The candidate answer explicitly states the opposite: 'The court decree (decreto) specifies exact duties,' 'The beneficiary retains rights not specifically assigned to the guardian,' and 'Seeking court approval for major decisions (selling property, etc.).' This directly contradicts the error described in the criterion, meaning the criterion is not satisfied (i.e., the response is correct regarding judicial limitations).
