It further notes that if the BIT is 'treaty-only,' the state must argue domestic law is relevant as part of the investment's legal framework. While it does not explicitly cite 'Article 42 of the ICSID Convention,' it thoroughly covers the concept of incorporating domestic law into the applicable law framework for counterclaims, which satisfies the intent of the criterion regarding the mechanism of incorporating domestic environmental obligations.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b21bb6a4-a9dd-4787-83a9-afdb78d12f8e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2937, "completion_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 3158}, "latency_s": 1.4521853330079466, "request_id": "6ByVaeCYGOyOkdUP_ZOcgQk", "raw_response": null}
