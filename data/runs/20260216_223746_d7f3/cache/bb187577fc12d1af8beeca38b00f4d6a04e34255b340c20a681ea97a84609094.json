The candidate response discusses the German firm's potential claim for reputational damages under German law (§ 823(1) BGB) and frames the defense strategy around the scope of the arbitration clause and the implied covenant of good faith under Delaware law. It discusses defending against the claim and the client's counterclaim for wrongful termination damages (lost profits, reliance damages). However, it never explicitly states or analyzes the specific causation standard (but-for causation) that the German firm (the plaintiff in arbitration) would need to meet under Delaware law (or any applicable law) to prove that the alleged security vulnerabilities *caused* the reputational harm. The discussion of causation is limited to whether the losses were caused by the vulnerabilities versus the termination itself, not the specific legal requirement of 'but-for' proof for reputational damages.\", \"criterion_id\": \"28978d72-d128-48d8-813a-427cc7e23507\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4196, "completion_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 4439}, "latency_s": 1.5528256249963306, "request_id": "MsOUaYxn6Z6R1Q-g8utx", "raw_response": null}
