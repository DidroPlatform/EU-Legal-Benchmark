The candidate answer focuses heavily on jurisdiction (seat, governing law, scope of the clause) and strategy, but it implicitly confirms the validity of the clause by proceeding to analyze its scope and effect. Specifically, the analysis of the German court threat relies on the premise that the arbitration clause is valid and enforceable under the New York Convention and German procedural law (\\u00a7 1032 ZPO), and that English courts will protect it. The response never suggests that the clause itself is voidable due to fraud, duress, or incapacity, thereby satisfying the requirement that the response identifies (by omission of any challenge) that no such grounds exist.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3728857a-38ce-4522-a3fe-08aa354add04\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4194, "completion_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 4405}, "latency_s": 1.1497978749976028, "request_id": "3MKUafjII6qEkdUPzIWYoAI", "raw_response": null}
