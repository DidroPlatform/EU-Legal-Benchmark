The candidate answer addresses the merits of the termination claim by stating: \\\"*On the early termination claim:* What does the contract say about termination rights? Were the security vulnerabilities material? Did they breach a warranty? Did your client have a cure period?\\\" This shows the response is focused on *investigating* whether a breach occurred based on the contract terms, rather than asserting that the facts *already presented* show no breach. However, the overall context of the client's position is that they believe the termination was pretextual (\\\"My client thinks they just found a cheaper product from someone else\\\"). The strategy section focuses heavily on defending against the *claim* of breach (vulnerabilities) and challenging damages, which implicitly supports the client's position that the termination was wrongful/not validly based on breach. Given the prompt only provides the German firm's *claim* (vulnerabilities) and the client's *suspicion* (cheaper product), the response correctly frames the next step as investigating the validity of the breach claim based on the contract, which is the necessary precursor to confirming whether a valid breach occurred. Since the client *believes* they did not breach, the response supports this by outlining the necessary steps to defend against the alleged breach, thus acknowledging the lack of established facts supporting a valid breach by the client.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d5afc437-3642-4325-9116-c899\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2274, "completion_tokens": 339, "total_tokens": 2613}, "latency_s": 1.9776850420166738, "request_id": "XOGUaZzQFMK0vdIP75DNmA8", "raw_response": null}
