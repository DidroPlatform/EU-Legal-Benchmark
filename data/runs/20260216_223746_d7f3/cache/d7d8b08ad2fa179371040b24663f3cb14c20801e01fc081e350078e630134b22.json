Let me separate the real problems from the negotiating pressure.\n\n## The Hard Truth About Lender Priority\n\nYes, the lender's charge *typically* has priority over your constructive trust claim—but with important nuances:\n\n**Standard position:**\n- A registered charge (mortgage) takes priority based on registration date, not when the money was advanced\n- Your constructive trust claim, even if successful, ranks *behind* secured creditors\n- If the property sells, the lender gets paid first from proceeds\n\n**But this doesn't automatically mean you get nothing:**\n\nThe lender's priority only extends to the *amount they actually advanced* (€200k) plus interest and costs. They don't have priority over the *entire equity*. The question is whether there's equity *beyond* their charge.\n\n## What You Actually Need to Know\n\n**1. What's the current property value?**\n\nThis is everything. If your renovations created €300k+ in value, there may be equity above the €200k charge. Example:\n\n- Property value before your work: €400k\n- Your investment: €180k (now €200k+ in added value)\n- Current value: €600k+\n- First mortgage: €200k (your ex's secret advance)\n- Equity above that charge: potentially €200k+\n\n**2. The lender's actual exposure**\n\nThe lender doesn't care about your dispute with your ex. They care about:\n- Whether the property is worth more than €200k\n- Whether it will sell\n- Whether they'll get paid\n\nIf there's substantial equity above their charge, they have *no interest* in blocking your claim—it doesn't affect them.\n\n**3. The \"secret advance\" angle**\n\nThis is where you might have leverage the solicitor isn't emphasizing:\n\n- **Fraud/misrepresentation to the lender**: Did your ex tell the lender the property was jointly owned? If the lender advanced money on a false representation that your ex had unencumbered title, that's a problem for *them*, not you.\n- **Potential lender liability**: Some jurisdictions recognize that a lender who advances money on a misrepresented title may have liability to the true owner.\n- **Negotiating position**: The lender may not want this scrutinized.\n\nThis varies significantly by jurisdiction (which you haven't specified—I'm assuming EU, possibly Ireland/UK?). This matters enormously.\n\n## What You Should Actually Do\n\n**Don't accept the \"walk away for €180k\" offer based on this reasoning.** Here's why:\n\n1. **Get an independent valuation** of the property *now*. You need to know if there's equity above the €200k charge.\n\n2. **Get proper legal advice on:**\n   - Whether the lender was told the property was solely owned by your ex\n   - Whether the lender's advance was obtained by misrepresentation\n   - Your jurisdiction's specific rules on lender priority vs. beneficial ownership claims\n   - Whether you have any claim against your ex for the secret remortgage (separate from the property claim)\n\n3. **Understand the lender's actual position:**\n   - Request a redemption statement from the lender\n   - Ask your solicitor to contact the lender's solicitor to understand their position\n   - They may be willing to cooperate if they understand you're not threatening their security\n\n4. **Don't let your ex's solicitor frame this as hopeless:**\n   - The \"you'll get nothing but a bill\" argument is partly true *if* there's no equity above the charge\n   - But it's also a negotiating tactic to pressure you into accepting their offer\n   - If there IS equity, this argument collapses\n\n## The Real Leverage Points\n\n- **The secret remortgage itself**: This may be a separate claim against your ex (fraud, breach of trust, conversion). Even if it doesn't affect the property claim, it's a counterclaim.\n- **The lender's exposure**: If they advanced money based on false information about title, they have their own problems.\n- **The buyer's withdrawal**: Why did they pull out? If it was because of the title issue, that's evidence the title problem is real and serious—which strengthens your position that your ex's conduct was wrongful.\n\n## What I'd Actually Advise\n\n1. **Don't negotiate from a position of assumed defeat.** Get the valuation and proper legal advice first.\n\n2. **Separate the issues:**\n   - Your constructive trust claim (property)\n   - Your claim for the secret remortgage (separate damages)\n   - The slander claim (your ex's problem, not yours)\n\n3. **Consider whether the lender might actually be your ally** rather than your enemy—if they understand they're not at risk, they may not care who owns the beneficial interest.\n\n4. **If there IS equity above the charge**, the lender's priority is irrelevant to your claim. You'd recover from that equity.\n\n5. **If there ISN'T equity above the charge**, then yes, you're in a difficult position—but that's a factual question, not a legal certainty.\n\n**What's your jurisdiction, and do you know the current property value?** That changes the analysis significantly.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 220, "completion_tokens": 1197, "total_tokens": 1417}, "latency_s": 13.886006417014869, "request_id": "chatcmpl-b7dc4a22-31a6-4681-b566-066752cbb046", "raw_response": null}
