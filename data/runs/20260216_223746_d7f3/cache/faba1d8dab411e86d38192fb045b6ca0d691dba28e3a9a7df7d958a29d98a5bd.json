The candidate answer discusses Moral Rights (Paternity/Integrity) in Section 3, noting that the right to be identified (Paternity, s.77) must be asserted, and the right to object to derogatory treatment (Integrity, s.80) is engaged if the altered version 'distorts or mutilates your work, or is prejudicial to your honour or reputation'. The answer does not explicitly state or confirm the premise of the criterion: that a breach of Moral Rights (Paternity/Integrity) *requires* copying the dialogue or plot. In fact, the discussion focuses on the visual character appropriation (artistic work) and the failure to credit the author, which relates to the visual/artistic expression, not necessarily the copying of dialogue or plot of the literary work. Therefore, the criterion's specific premise is not confirmed or addressed.\", \"criterion_id\": \"dee7a094-b7fc-411f-acad-ef932f692be7\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3469, "completion_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 3716}, "latency_s": 0.9941304170060903, "request_id": "G8CUaan8GdjpnsEPmcvxyAE", "raw_response": null}
