The candidate answer implies the user is driving illegally because they failed the test and are presumably driving on a provisional license without supervision, but it never explicitly states that driving unsupervised with a learner's license is illegal. Instead, it focuses on the invalidity of the IDP and the consequences of 'Driving without a valid license'. While the underlying situation implies driving on a learner's permit without supervision, the specific statement required by the criterion is missing.\", \"criterion_id\": \"eb545792-32ff-4d27-b44a-8f37a958dd90\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 567, "completion_tokens": 165, "total_tokens": 732}, "latency_s": 0.6419670000032056, "request_id": "uMiUaY7AKo3hnsEPj-nr0Q8", "raw_response": null}
