The candidate answer does not explicitly mention the 'manifest disregard of the law' doctrine or state that it is inapplicable to foreign awards under the New York Convention. However, the response extensively covers the narrow grounds for refusal under Article V (jurisdiction, due process, public policy) and cites relevant Supreme Court and Circuit Court precedent supporting a narrow review standard for foreign awards, which implicitly excludes the broader domestic standard of manifest disregard. Since the criterion is highly specific and the candidate answer omits the direct statement, the grade must be 0 based on strict adherence to the rubric requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"0b829d90-0ded-4a7c-9508-72d4252c8baa\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4041, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 4242}, "latency_s": 0.996391417022096, "request_id": "L82UaZjCJP3onsEP3cCnyQM", "raw_response": null}
