The candidate answer explicitly states that host-state counterclaims are **not automatically excluded**, but are **often rejected** due to lack of consent, insufficient nexus, or domestic law issues. While it notes that tribunals often require express consent (the 'Symmetry / express or clearly implied consent' approach), it immediately contrasts this with the 'Dispute-based / implied consent' approach and cites several leading cases (like *Urbaser* and *Burlington*) where counterclaims *were* admitted and upheld, even when the treaty was silent on counterclaims. Therefore, the response does not assert the strict position required by the criterion (that they are usually inadmissible unless expressly mentioned); rather, it presents a nuanced view that admissibility depends heavily on the specific wording of the consent clause.\", \"criterion_id\": \"191e67ef-7b2a-4b3a-a1e2-fe9e20a8a0b8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2935, "completion_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 3166}, "latency_s": 1.7153426249860786, "request_id": "Hx2VaaPaHvujkdUP0fjD0QU", "raw_response": null}
