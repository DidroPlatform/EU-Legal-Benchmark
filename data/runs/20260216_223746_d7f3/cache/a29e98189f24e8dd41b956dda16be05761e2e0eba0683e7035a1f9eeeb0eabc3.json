The candidate answer lists several critical provisions (like Tag-Along, Veto Rights, Liquidation Preference) and discusses their justification under German law and market practice, but it fails to explicitly state the crucial legal requirement that these specific shareholder rights (especially those modifying statutory rights or creating obligations between shareholders) must generally be incorporated into the GmbH's Articles of Association (Satzung) to be fully enforceable against the company or third parties, beyond just being in the Shareholders' Agreement (SHA). The answer mentions notarization requirements for SHA amendments and share transfers, but misses the core point about Satzung inclusion for enforceability of the substantive rights themselves.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f462ad42-2453-401c-bc17-67772f6a802f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2558, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 2787}, "latency_s": 4.88867908300017, "request_id": "Zc6Uabj5E9X1kdUPq5K00AM", "raw_response": null}
