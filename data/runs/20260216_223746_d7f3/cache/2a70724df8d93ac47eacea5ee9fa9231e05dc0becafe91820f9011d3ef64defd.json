The candidate answer strongly recommends negotiating a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with HMRC and then pursuing a parallel mitigation plan for civil litigation, which includes a 'technical defense' based on superseding fraud and setting up a settlement fund. While the response discusses leveraging the logistics firm's insurers and filing a cross-claim against them as part of the mitigation strategy (Section 7, Risk table), it does not explicitly recommend filing a formal counter-claim or separate legal action against the logistics firm as a primary, distinct strategic recommendation in the main decision framework or TL;DR section. The focus is on defense and settlement against the civil plaintiffs, not initiating a new offensive action against the logistics firm.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b752b596-6357-4c73-b603-fa2168506389\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4488, "completion_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 4701}, "latency_s": 1.0367416249937378, "request_id": "kO2Uaaz2I_minsEP9fLK0AM", "raw_response": null}
