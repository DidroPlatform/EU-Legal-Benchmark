The candidate answer specifies KPIs with targets and red flags (which act as thresholds) for several controls (e.g., Control 1: target \\u226595%; red flag <90%). However, it fails to explicitly define the 'materiality thresholds/tolerances' for most controls, focusing only on the KPI target. More critically, while it mentions an 'Escalation Protocol' generally ('Any KPI breach >10% variance triggers immediate CFO/Audit Committee notification'), it does not define the specific 'predefined escalation/remediation triggers and timelines' *for each individual control point* as required by the criterion. For example, for Control 1, it states the KPI breach triggers escalation, but it does not specify the required remediation timeline associated with that breach.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c81f11b1-1de7-4a08-9bea-c09bd530c8ac\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1477, "completion_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 1720}, "latency_s": 1.9403475419967435, "request_id": "2TKVaaK8C8eC7M8P_tvRkAs", "raw_response": null}
