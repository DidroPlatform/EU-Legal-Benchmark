The candidate answer lists three points under 'Key Negotiation Points': 1. Retail price, 2. Your royalty percentage, and 3. Rights granted (duration, territory, format exclusivity). While royalty percentage and rights granted are valid levers, 'Retail price' is the subject of the user's question, and the answer doesn't specify concrete levers *related to* setting or changing the price (like price floor/ceiling or consultation rights) as suggested in the examples. It lists general areas, but not three distinct, concrete contractual levers beyond the general royalty rate and rights scope. It fails to meet the specificity implied by the examples provided in the criterion description.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f3a73fbc-9aee-4a68-b68d-4a8cf0c429fd\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 695, "completion_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 923}, "latency_s": 0.9847899999876972, "request_id": "KteUac_zN8f5nsEPi7DUqAI", "raw_response": null}
