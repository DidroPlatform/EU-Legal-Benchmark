The candidate answer discusses the admissibility of counterclaims based on domestic environmental law (Section 3), noting that tribunals must determine if the counterclaim falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement and if the investor has obligations under domestic law. However, it does not explicitly define or elaborate on the concept of 'host-state regulatory space' or the 'sovereign margin' for legitimate regulation, which is a distinct concept from the jurisdictional hurdles for admitting a counterclaim based on that regulation. The focus remains on jurisdiction and applicable law, not the substantive scope of the state's regulatory power itself.\", \"criterion_id\": \"61fb34f1-4da2-4a96-8f69-5c0719d0ec0a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2935, "completion_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 3127}, "latency_s": 0.6525067500188015, "request_id": "Ch2VaeyFJdWbkdUPueCoyAM", "raw_response": null}
