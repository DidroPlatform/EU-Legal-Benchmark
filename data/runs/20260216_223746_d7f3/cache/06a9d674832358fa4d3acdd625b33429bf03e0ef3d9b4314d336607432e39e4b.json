The response discusses the implications of equity vs. debt financing and the impact of using an Irish sister subsidiary, which addresses financing choices and structural tiers. However, it does not explicitly recommend or describe two distinct forms of structural flexibility like 'hybrid-to-debt conversion options' or 'modular entity design' as required by the criterion. The discussion focuses on the tax consequences of the initial financing choices rather than proposing specific, named structural flexibility mechanisms beyond the basic equity/debt split and tiering.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5338ade1-d4a6-44bc-b8f6-9728ea8a5fc1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1327, "completion_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 1503}, "latency_s": 0.9848150830366649, "request_id": "YzSVaazuDYDHnsEPq_XX6Qg", "raw_response": null}
