The candidate response details controls for DTA, DPT, and GAAR. Control #3 is 'Intra-Group Pricing Benchmarking,' which is related to Transfer Pricing (TP), but the control is not explicitly named 'Transfer Pricing Compliance.' More critically, the reporting cadence listed for Control #3 is 'Quarterly (including peer benchmarking variance <5%)', which satisfies the 'quarterly reviews' part of the criterion. However, since the control name does not exactly match the criterion's specified control name ('Transfer Pricing Compliance'), and the criterion is highly specific, I must grade strictly against the exact wording. The closest control is present, but the name mismatch prevents a definitive '1'.\", \"criterion_id\": \"63c199bd-96ce-47c1-b5dd-751d1b859f3c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1465, "completion_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 1682}, "latency_s": 1.2844133750186302, "request_id": "tTKVacmhMOO9kdUPqsTX2Qg", "raw_response": null}
