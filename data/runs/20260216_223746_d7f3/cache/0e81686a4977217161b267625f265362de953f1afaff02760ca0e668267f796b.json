It does not present the specific argument required by the criterion (that the swerving itself was reasonable because the chair was unexpected/unseen, implying the drunk driver's reaction was standard, not extraordinary). Instead, it focuses on the foreseeability of *swerving* generally, not the foreseeability of the *driver's specific reaction* based on the unexpected nature of the obstacle itself.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e6c03261-2d1c-42d6-bea6-ac11720c84cf\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1260, "completion_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 1457}, "latency_s": 0.8641911669983529, "request_id": "o9GUaZ7EDKOrnsEP8_bgmQE", "raw_response": null}
