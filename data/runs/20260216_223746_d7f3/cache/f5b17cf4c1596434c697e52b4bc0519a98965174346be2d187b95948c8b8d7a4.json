Consent (the \\\"Offer to Arbitrate\\\" Question)'. It specifically addresses how the wording of the arbitration clause (narrow vs. broad language like 'disputes concerning an investment' versus 'any dispute relating to investments') is central to the analysis. It also correctly notes the relevance of the applicable arbitral rules (UNCITRAL vs. ICSID) in establishing procedural consent, which is highly relevant given the facts provided (UNCITRAL Rules, silent BIT). The inclusion of leading cases like *Saluka* and *Burlington Resources* directly supports the explanation of how tribunals interpret the BIT wording.\", \"criterion_id\": \"15177ed6-4514-4e8b-8f4f-02bf64fce179\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3327, "completion_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 3514}, "latency_s": 1.6124222920043394, "request_id": "V8GUacCjAoy0vdIP55ysuQ4", "raw_response": null}
