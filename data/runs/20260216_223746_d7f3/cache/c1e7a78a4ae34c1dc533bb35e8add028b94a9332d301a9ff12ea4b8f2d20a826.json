The candidate answer provides one specific precedent (TOTVS S.A. merger in 2023) but this precedent is internal to Brazil/Chile/Mexico and does not fit the requested examples (LATAM-Delta or Bayer-Monsanto), which typically illustrate complex, multi-jurisdictional coordination involving major global players or specific regional regulatory challenges that highlight the need for coordination between national authorities.
