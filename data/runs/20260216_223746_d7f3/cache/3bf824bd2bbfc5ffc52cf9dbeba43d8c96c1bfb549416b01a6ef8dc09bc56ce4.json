The candidate answer explicitly addresses the Italian context, noting that unauthorized derivative uses, including 'political theming' (which covers the workers' rights shirt), likely constitute infringement. While it primarily frames the issue under general infringement and merchandising rights, the Italian legal framework strongly protects moral rights, including the right of integrity (Diritto Morale, Art. 20 LDA), which prevents distortion or modification of the work. The response mentions that exceptions like parody are narrow and that the modifications are likely infringement, which aligns with the spirit of protecting integrity against unauthorized alterations, even if the specific term 'right of integrity' isn't used for that specific shirt, the overall context of unauthorized modification leading to infringement in Italy is clearly established.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a87ee2ed-7a89-48f0-9c97-02ca08e4b193\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1658, "completion_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 1894}, "latency_s": 1.3201853750506416, "request_id": "HjWVacDsCvWNxs0PtLSW2QE", "raw_response": null}
