Those dealing with administration receive services **appropriately/properly** (asianmukaisesti)\n2. The authority can perform its tasks **effectively/successfully** (tuloksellisesti)\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A**: \"asianmukaisesti\" (appropriately) + \"tuloksellisesti\" (effectively) - This matches the correct legal formulation.\n\n**Option B**: Uses \"asiattomasti\" (improperly/inappropriately) - This is clearly wrong as it contradicts the purpose of good administration.\n\n**Option C**: Uses \"tuloksetta\" (without results/ineffectively) - This contradicts the goal of effective administration.\n\n**Option D**: Reverses the roles - has the citizen performing tasks effectively and the authority receiving tasks appropriately - This is backwards and nonsensical.\n\n{\"answer\": \"A\", \"reasoning\": \"Option A correctly states the service principle from the Administrative Procedure Act: services should be provided appropriately to citizens and authorities should perform their tasks effectively. The other options contain incorrect terms (improperly, ineffectively) or reversed roles.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 471, "completion_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 766}, "latency_s": 7.694237249990692, "request_id": "chatcmpl-b1599371-fc9f-4466-a4e2-08f7c15616c7", "raw_response": null}
