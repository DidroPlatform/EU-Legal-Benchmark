The candidate answer discusses \\u00a7245A eligibility for dividends from specified 10%-owned foreign corporations and contrasts this with GILTI inclusions, noting that GILTI inclusions are taxable (with FTC considerations) and that avoiding hybrid dividends is necessary to keep \\u00a7245A eligibility clean. However, it never explicitly states the direct proposition required by the criterion: that \\u00a7245A does not apply to GILTI inclusions.
