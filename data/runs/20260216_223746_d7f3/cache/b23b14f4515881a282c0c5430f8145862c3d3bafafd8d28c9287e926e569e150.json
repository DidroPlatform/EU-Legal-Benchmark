{"provider": "mistral_api", "model": "mistral/mistral-large-latest", "text": "In your situation, you may have **legal protections as a long-term occupier in England**, even though you haven’t been paying rent. Here’s a breakdown of your rights and potential options:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Are You a \"Tenant\" or a \"Licensee\"?**\nYour legal status depends on whether you have **exclusive possession** of the room and whether there was an agreement (written or verbal) about your occupation.\n\n- **If you have exclusive possession of the room** (i.e., the landlord cannot enter without your permission, and you control who comes in), you may be a **tenant** under the **Rent Act 1977** or **Housing Act 1988**, even if you don’t pay rent.\n  - **Rent Act 1977** (if you moved in before **15 January 1989**) gives you **lifetime security of tenure** (you can stay as long as you want, and the landlord can only evict you with a court order for specific reasons, like rent arrears or antisocial behaviour).\n  - **Housing Act 1988** (if you moved in after **15 January 1989**) may give you an **assured tenancy** if you have exclusive possession and the landlord accepted you as a tenant (even without rent). However, this is less likely if you were allowed to stay as a **licensee** (e.g., a lodger or guest).\n\n- **If you are a licensee** (e.g., the landlord could enter your room, or you shared facilities like a kitchen/bathroom with others), you have **fewer protections** and can be asked to leave with **reasonable notice** (usually **28 days** in writing).\n\n**Key question:** Did you have a **lock on your door**? Did the landlord ever enter without your permission? If yes, you likely have **exclusive possession** and may be a tenant.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Did You Have a \"Periodic Tenancy\" or a \"Fixed-Term Tenancy\"?**\n- If you’ve been there **10 years without a written agreement**, you likely have a **periodic tenancy** (rolling weekly/monthly).\n- If the landlord **never asked you to leave** in 10 years, this could imply **implied acceptance of a tenancy**, even without rent.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Can the New Owner Evict You?**\n- **If you are a tenant (not a licensee):**\n  - The new owner **inherits the tenancy** and **cannot simply evict you** without a court order.\n  - They must follow the **legal eviction process** (Section 8 or Section 21 notice under the Housing Act 1988).\n  - If you have a **Rent Act 1977 tenancy**, they **cannot evict you without a court order** for a valid reason (e.g., rent arrears, property damage, or if they want to live there themselves).\n  - If you have an **assured tenancy**, they can serve a **Section 21 notice** (2 months’ notice) but **cannot force you out without a court order**.\n\n- **If you are a licensee:**\n  - They can ask you to leave with **reasonable notice** (usually **28 days** in writing).\n  - If you refuse, they may need a **court order** (but this is easier for them than if you were a tenant).\n\n---\n\n### **4. What About Your Belongings?**\n- The new owner **cannot just throw out your belongings**—they must follow the **Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977**.\n- If they remove your things without your consent, you could **sue for damages**.\n- If you **ignored the buyer’s message**, this could weaken your position, but it doesn’t automatically mean you’ve abandoned the property.\n\n---\n\n### **5. What Should You Do Now?**\n#### **Step 1: Confirm Your Legal Status**\n- **Check if you have exclusive possession** (e.g., do you have a lock on your door? Did the landlord ever enter without permission?).\n- **Look for any old emails/texts/letters** that might show you were treated as a tenant (e.g., references to \"rent,\" \"tenancy,\" or \"agreement\").\n- **Consult a housing solicitor or advice service** (see below for free help).\n\n#### **Step 2: Respond to the New Owner**\n- **Do not ignore them**—this could be seen as abandonment.\n- **Write a polite but firm email/letter** saying:\n  > *\"I have been living in this property for 10 years and believe I have a tenancy. I am seeking legal advice on my rights and will respond formally once I have done so. In the meantime, I expect to be given proper notice and due process before any attempt to remove me or my belongings.\"*\n\n#### **Step 3: Get Legal Advice (Free Options)**\n- **[Shelter England](https://england.shelter.org.uk/)** (Free housing advice)\n- **[Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/)** (Free legal guidance)\n- **[Law Centres Network](https://www.lawcentres.org.uk/)** (Free or low-cost legal help)\n- **[JustAnswer UK](https://www.justanswer.co.uk/)** (Paid but affordable legal Q&A)\n\n#### **Step 4: If They Try to Evict You Illegally**\n- **Do not leave voluntarily**—once you’re out, it’s much harder to fight.\n- **Call the police if they try to force you out** (illegal eviction is a criminal offence under the **Protection from Eviction Act 1977**).\n- **Keep records** (photos, messages, witness statements).\n\n#### **Step 5: Negotiate or Challenge the Eviction**\n- If you **are a tenant**, the new owner must go to court to evict you.\n- If you **are a licensee**, they may still need a court order if you refuse to leave.\n- You may be able to **negotiate a cash settlement** (e.g., \"I’ll leave if you pay me £X for relocation costs\").\n\n---\n\n### **6. Worst-Case Scenario: You Have to Leave**\nIf you **don’t have a tenancy** and must leave:\n- **Demand compensation** for your belongings and moving costs.\n- **Check if you qualify for homelessness assistance** from your local council (if you have no other housing options).\n- **Document everything** in case you need to take legal action later.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n✅ **You may have strong protections** if you’ve been there 10 years with exclusive possession.\n✅ **The new owner cannot just kick you out**—they need a court order if you’re a tenant.\n✅ **Do not ignore them**—respond in writing and seek legal advice.\n✅ **Free help is available** (Shelter, Citizens Advice, Law Centres).\n✅ **If they try to force you out, call the police**—illegal eviction is a crime.\n\nWould you like help drafting a response to the new owner?
