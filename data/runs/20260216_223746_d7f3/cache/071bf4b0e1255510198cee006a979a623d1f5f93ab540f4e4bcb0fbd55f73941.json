In the 'Executive Summary' table, Option A (Accept £1.4 M) is presented as the immediate cash option, and the risk analysis implies that litigation (Option B) carries a high risk of incurring massive legal bills and potentially losing, resulting in a final award that could be less than the guaranteed £1.4 million. Furthermore, the 'Step-3' decision tree explicitly states: 'If the estimated reputational damage is \\u2264 \\u00a3500k (i.e., can be mitigated by PR), accept money.' This directly addresses the core of the criterion by suggesting that if the potential damages award from a successful defamation suit is less than the guaranteed settlement, the settlement is the safer financial choice.\", \"criterion_id\": \"725d5b85-42c5-4769-857e-bffae403cdcb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4326, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 4549}, "latency_s": 1.2820680410368368, "request_id": "Z-qUab2NE42t28oP27iLoAg", "raw_response": null}
