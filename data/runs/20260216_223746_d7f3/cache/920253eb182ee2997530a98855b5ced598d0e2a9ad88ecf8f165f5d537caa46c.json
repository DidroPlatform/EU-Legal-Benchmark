Genuine Substance Defense**\n- Real people doing real work = defeats \"shell company\" challenge\n- Actual value creation in Ireland = commercial justification\n- OECD BEPS-compliant (substance over form)\n\n**2. Transfer Pricing Defense**\n- Not transferring all existing value immediately\n- Ireland pays for/creates what it owns\n- Ongoing payments reflect actual services rendered\n- Comparable to genuine multinational structures\n\n**3. Gradual Implementation**\n- Avoids \"overnight profit shift\" red flag\n- Demonstrates evolving business strategy\n- Time to build documentation and evidence trail\n\n### Critical Success Factors\n\n**You MUST have:**\n- **Real Irish employees** (not you working remotely, not contractors)\n- **Genuine development activity** in Ireland (documented, verifiable)\n- **Arm's length pricing** on all intercompany transactions\n- **Board meetings in Ireland** with documented strategic decisions\n- **Contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation**\n\n### Realistic Outcome\n\n**Profit shift achievable:** 55-65% to Ireland (not 80-90%)\n\n**Cost to achieve this:**\n- Irish salaries: £150-250k annually\n- Office/infrastructure: £30-50k annually\n- Professional fees (setup + ongoing): £50-75k\n- **Total annual cost: £230-375k**\n\n**Timeline:** 2-3 years to full implementation\n\n**HMRC challenge risk:** Moderate (not low, but defensible)\n\n---\n\n## The Brutal Truth\n\nThis is **expensive and slow**, but it's the only approach that:\n1. Achieves >50% profit shift\n2. Has genuine defensibility\n3. Doesn't rely on HMRC \"not noticing\"\n\n**If the client won't accept this level of investment and timeline**, then honestly, there is no legitimate structure that achieves their goals. They would be choosing between:\n- **Aggressive structures** (high risk, potential fraud territory)\n- **Staying in the UK** (commercial reality for most owner-managed businesses)\n\nThe uncomfortable reality: **Most UK software businesses of this size cannot legitimately shift majority profits offshore.** Those that do either have genuine multinational operations (which costs money) or are taking significant legal risks.\n\nWhat's the client's appetite for this level of commitment?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 121, "completion_tokens": 914, "total_tokens": 1035}, "latency_s": 22.28383537501213, "request_id": "chatcmpl-0a9f7c24-b7b8-483c-9761-aa960dc4e815", "raw_response": null}
