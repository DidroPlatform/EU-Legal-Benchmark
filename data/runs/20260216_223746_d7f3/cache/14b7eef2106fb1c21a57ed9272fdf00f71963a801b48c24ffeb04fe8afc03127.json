The candidate answer discusses the admissibility of counterclaims related to environmental law violations (Poland's counterclaim) and cites cases like *Perenco* where environmental damage claims were considered. However, it does not explicitly define or discuss the *concept* of the host-state's regulatory space or sovereign margin for legitimate regulation, which is a distinct legal concept often invoked when assessing whether a state's action (or counterclaim) falls within its legitimate regulatory powers, separate from the jurisdictional hurdle of whether the tribunal can hear the claim. The focus is entirely on jurisdiction and admissibility tests, not the scope of sovereignty.\", \"criterion_id\": \"61fb34f1-4da2-4a96-8f69-5c0719d0ec0a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2604, "completion_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 2800}, "latency_s": 1.4766565839818213, "request_id": "AdCUaeXoIqiSkdUPusP7uA8", "raw_response": null}
