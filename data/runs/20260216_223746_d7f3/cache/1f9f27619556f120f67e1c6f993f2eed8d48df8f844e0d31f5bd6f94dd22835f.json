The candidate answer correctly analyzes that the chair is not a *novus actus interveniens* (Section 2.1 and 2.5) and that B's swerving *is* the proximate cause. However, the analysis focuses on B's act being the proximate cause, not on arguing that B's act was *not* intervening in the sense that a reasonable person would have done the same thing. Instead, the answer argues that a reasonable person *would* foresee the risk of swerving (Section 2.3), which is a different point. The specific argument required by the criterion—that the swerving itself was a reasonable response to the unexpected chair—is not explicitly made or supported as the primary reason why B's act is not an intervening cause that breaks the chain from the initial event (the chair falling). The analysis focuses on B's act being the *proximate cause* of C's injury, not on B's act being *non-intervening* relative to the initial event.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e6c03261-2d1c-42d6-bea6-ac11720c84cf\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3203, "completion_tokens": 306, "total_tokens": 3509}, "latency_s": 1.2440199999837205, "request_id": "lu-UadDfCMyynsEP0d_uiAQ", "raw_response": null}
