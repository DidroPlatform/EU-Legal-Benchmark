The candidate answer mentions Tag-Along Rights (Point 2) and states: \\\"Lets you join any founder-led sale on same terms, preventing exclusion in partial exits.\\\" This definition is accurate but does not explicitly use the term 'pro rata portion' as specified in the criterion, although 'join any founder-led sale' implies a pro rata mechanism in this context. However, for strict adherence to the criterion's exact phrasing, it falls slightly short of explicitly stating 'pro rata portion'.\", \"criterion_id\": \"32a99ce4-2e4a-42d1-bf72-6db07c939b16\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1664, "completion_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 1848}, "latency_s": 1.765652834030334, "request_id": "CSqVabyVLqSDkdUP5IaYkQM", "raw_response": null}
