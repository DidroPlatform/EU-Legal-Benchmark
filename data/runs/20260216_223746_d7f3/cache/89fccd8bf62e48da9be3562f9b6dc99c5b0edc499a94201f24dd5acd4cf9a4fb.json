The candidate answer uses the structure: 1. Effectiveness of Pay Transparency and Equal Pay Reporting (which includes evidence and limitations), 2. Enforcement Mechanisms, and 3. Conclusion. While it has three main headings, the internal structure does not clearly map to the suggested tripartite structure (Comparative Analysis, Methodological Critique, Next-Generation Policies). The second section is purely about enforcement, and the conclusion is brief. It lacks a dedicated, clearly labeled section for a 'Methodological Critique' or 'Next-Generation Policies' that would satisfy the 'e.g.' examples provided in the rubric.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9dc8c858-729a-4e47-8b4b-e43269dae863\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1932, "completion_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 2139}, "latency_s": 12.486139375017956, "request_id": "QjOVacPXOv367M8P1uGygAU", "raw_response": null}
