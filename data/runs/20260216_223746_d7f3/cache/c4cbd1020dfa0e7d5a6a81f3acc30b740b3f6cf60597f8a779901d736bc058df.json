The candidate answer discusses moral rights, specifically mentioning Section 84, but it frames the discussion around the right not to have a work falsely attributed to *you* (the author) when someone else is credited, which is the opposite of the criterion's focus. The criterion states the right applies to the person whose name is *wrongly used* (i.e., falsely attributed to them). The candidate discusses the right to be identified (s.77) and the right not to have your work falsely attributed (s.84), but it does not explicitly state the legal scope required by the criterion: that the right applies to the person whose name is wrongly used (i.e., the person falsely credited). Instead, it discusses the potential for the author to enforce their rights when someone else is credited, which is related but does not capture the specific legal statement required by the rubric.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b18b6758-1ae6-44c6-b6fe-3f5bc295de82\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3485, "completion_tokens": 267, "total_tokens": 3752}, "latency_s": 1.0630780000064988, "request_id": "EcCUaZzTHaDxnsEP86zG2AI", "raw_response": null}
