The candidate answer discusses Section 44 of the Arbitration Act 1996, but it focuses on the court's power to *grant* interim relief (Section 44(1) or (2)), not the power of the tribunal to *revoke* a court order under Section 44(6). Section 44(6) deals with the tribunal's power to vary or revoke an order made by the court under Section 44(3). Since the specific mention of Section 44(6) regarding the tribunal's power to revoke is absent, the criterion is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3b951acb-152e-4be0-a915-e1528b4664a3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1002, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 1218}, "latency_s": 0.8010063339897897, "request_id": "0MyUabKcJJTlnsEP9NTwiQU", "raw_response": null}
