The candidate answer correctly identifies that Chile requires merger notifications to the FNE (under Section 4A), but it incorrectly cites the governing statute for Chilean corporations as 'Ley 28.046' in Section 2C, and then correctly identifies the relevant statute as 'Ley 18.046' in the same section. Crucially, the response *never* mentions or cites 'Decreto Ley 211' in relation to FNE notifications. Therefore, the specific citation required by the criterion is missing.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9b7ae9ee-f2cc-4e51-850b-dc8702070b7d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4810, "completion_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 4996}, "latency_s": 0.8018915000138804, "request_id": "cR-Vaa6ELNz07M8PwPSugQU", "raw_response": null}
