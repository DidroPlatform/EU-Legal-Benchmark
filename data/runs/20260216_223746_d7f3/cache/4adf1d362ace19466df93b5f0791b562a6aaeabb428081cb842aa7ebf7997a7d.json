The candidate answer discusses the NL-SG DTA and the UK-SG DTA, but it does not explicitly state that the UK-SG DTA limits double taxation *similar to the NE-SG treaty* (which is not mentioned in the prompt or context, suggesting 'NE' might be a typo for 'NL' or another jurisdiction, but the criterion specifically mentions 'NE-SG'). More critically, the response focuses heavily on the NL-SG treaty and the UK-SG treaty's 0% WHT, but it fails to confirm the existence of a UK-Singapore DTA that limits double taxation in a manner analogous to the specified (though potentially misstated) NE-SG treaty, which is the core requirement of this specific criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d95e0739-9b6d-47af-9399-80ae5fb237bb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1070, "completion_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 1315}, "latency_s": 0.8401894160197116, "request_id": "fSOVaeLdNZC-nsEPxMmk4QY", "raw_response": null}
