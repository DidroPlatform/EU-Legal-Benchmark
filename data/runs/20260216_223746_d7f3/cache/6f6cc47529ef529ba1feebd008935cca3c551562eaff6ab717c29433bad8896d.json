The candidate answer discusses the *grounds* the landlord might use (Section 8, which covers breaches like rent arrears or anti-social behaviour) and then lists types of evidence the tenant should gather to prove they are *not* in the wrong. While it mentions rent payments as a potential issue, it does not explicitly list two distinct types of tenancy breach that the landlord might be alleging. It focuses on the tenant's defense against an unspecified claim, rather than detailing two potential breaches themselves.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8a3d1e61-d07b-42b4-9e15-bf239c2edd27\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1704, "completion_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 1883}, "latency_s": 0.9740095000015572, "request_id": "NSyVaZeYHqL17M8Pt6zc8AU", "raw_response": null}
