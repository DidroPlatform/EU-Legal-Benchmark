The candidate answer discusses GILTI extensively, the impact of debt on GILTI inclusions, the high-tax exception for GILTI, and the interaction between GILTI and the 100% DRD. However, it never explicitly mentions Subpart F income, tested income under GILTI excluding Subpart F income, or the mechanism by which payment characterization (e.g., interest vs. dividend) dictates whether the income falls under the Subpart F regime or the GILTI regime. The discussion is focused on GILTI mechanics and FTC limitations, not the boundary between Subpart F and GILTI.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f9ecd0f0-4a16-43f1-a9bf-1ac20638d5f4\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1996, "completion_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 2208}, "latency_s": 5.9100592079921626, "request_id": "GPOUac2iF67pnsEP2M6v6QU", "raw_response": null}
