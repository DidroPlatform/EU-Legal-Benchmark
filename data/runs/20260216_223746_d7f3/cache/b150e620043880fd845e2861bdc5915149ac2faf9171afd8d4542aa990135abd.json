The candidate answer explicitly addresses this under Section 1.1 (Article 3 FSO), stating that the neighbouring company, as a leaseholder using the premises for their trade, is 'also a responsible person.' Furthermore, in Section 3.1, it notes that the neighbouring company has its own independent duty to carry out a fire risk assessment and take general fire precautions as a responsible person under Article 3 of the FSO. This directly covers the concept of assigning/sharing responsibilities via the lease/occupancy arrangement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"938b8ea8-338e-4b84-90ec-be0a7edc224e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4413, "completion_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 4592}, "latency_s": 2.1739694999996573, "request_id": "5L6Uad60LcDw7M8P6KGOoQI", "raw_response": null}
