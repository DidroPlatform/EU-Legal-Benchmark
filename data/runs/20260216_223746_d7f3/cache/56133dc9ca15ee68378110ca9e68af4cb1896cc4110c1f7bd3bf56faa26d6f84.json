Capacity of judgement (Urteilsfähigkeit) IS presumed under Swiss civil law (Art. 16 ZGB). This statement is CORRECT.\\n\\nii. The Digest/Pandects was compiled under Justinian (around 530 CE) from works of Roman jurists from roughly the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE. This statement is CORRECT.\\n\\niii. Switzerland's neutrality was formally recognized at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, NOT the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. While the Peace of Westphalia recognized Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire, formal recognition of neutrality came later. This statement is INCORRECT.\\n\\niv. Legal sociology develops theories that simplify segments of reality - this sounds more like a description of legal dogmatics or economic models. Legal sociology studies law as a social phenomenon empirically. However, the statement about simplifying segments of reality in an exemplary way could describe model-building in social science. This is actually a reasonable description of theoretical work in sociology. But the phrasing 'in an exemplary way' (modellhaft) is more characteristic of economic theory or ideal types. This statement appears CORRECT as a general description of social science theory-building, including legal sociology.\\n\\nv. A limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) under Swiss law requires at least one general partner with unlimited liability and at least one limited partner. The statement says it has ONLY partners with limited liability, which is INCORRECT.\\n\\nSo statements iii and v are incorrect.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 361, "completion_tokens": 372, "total_tokens": 733}, "latency_s": 7.670778457977576, "request_id": "chatcmpl-7b7bdaa6-6fad-40eb-8dcb-ec4fc7ee4d33", "raw_response": null}
