Statement ii is correct: Art. 16 ZGB defines capacity of judgment essentially as stated - a person has capacity of judgment unless they lack the ability to act rationally due to age, mental disability, mental disorder, intoxication, or similar circumstances. It is indeed a key concept of Swiss law of persons. Statement iii is incorrect: Cantons cannot introduce a VAT. Under Art. 130 of the Federal Constitution, VAT is an exclusive federal tax. Cantons are prohibited from levying taxes that the federal constitution reserves to the Confederation. Statement iv is correct: The Federal Assembly consists of the National Council and Council of States, which are equal chambers (bicameral system with perfect bicameralism), and both must agree on legislation including federal acts (Art. 148-149 Federal Constitution). Therefore only statement iii is incorrect.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 429, "completion_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 659}, "latency_s": 5.520079917012481, "request_id": "chatcmpl-936c2936-9fd5-4395-976a-5b193287e608", "raw_response": null}
