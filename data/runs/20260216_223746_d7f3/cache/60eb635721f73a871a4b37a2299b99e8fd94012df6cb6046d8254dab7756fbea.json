{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 1, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion states that the response should be graded 1 if it *incorrectly* states that guardianship automatically grants power over all financial and personal decisions without judicial limitations. The candidate answer explicitly details that the court assesses proportionality and necessity, and that the guardian's responsibilities include 'Accounting to the court periodically' and acting in the person's 'documented interests.' This directly contradicts the premise of automatic, unlimited power, meaning the response does *not* make the error described in the criterion. Therefore, the criterion is not satisfied (i.e., the response is correct regarding limitations), leading to a grade of 1 based on the rubric's instruction to assign grade=1 only if the criterion is satisfied (meaning the error described in the criterion occurred). Since the error did *not* occur, the grade should be 0. Re-evaluating the instruction: 'Assign grade=1 only if the criterion is clearly satisfied; otherwise grade=0.' The criterion is a negative statement about an error: 'The response incorrectly states X.' If the response *does not* incorrectly state X (i.e., it correctly states the opposite or is nuanced), the criterion is *not* satisfied. Therefore, grade must be 0.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8cd172aa-79b6-4745-9610-d45cdac4333e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 648, "completion_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 949}, "latency_s": 1.143161458981922, "request_id": "OdiUaYudBemekdUPuPLrcQ", "raw_response": null}
