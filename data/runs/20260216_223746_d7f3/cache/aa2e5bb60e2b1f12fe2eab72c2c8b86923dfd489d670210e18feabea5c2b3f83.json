Let me break down where you stand legally:\n\n## The Good News First\n\n**You DO have copyright protection!** In the UK, copyright is **automatic** from the moment you create original work. You don't need to register anything. The moment you drew those 40 pages of 'Nexus', they were protected under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.\n\nYou own:\n- The artistic copyright in your illustrations\n- Rights in the characters and their visual representation\n- Moral rights (including the right to be identified as the author)\n\n## The Training Issue (The Complicated Part)\n\nThe AI training scraping is legally murky and rapidly evolving:\n\n- UK law *does* have a text and data mining (TDM) exception, BUT it's primarily for non-commercial research\n- There's debate about whether commercial AI training falls under this\n- You could potentially argue they've infringed by reproducing your work in their training process\n- This area is currently being tested in courts (including ongoing cases in the US)\n\n## The Advertisement (Your Strongest Case)\n\n**This is likely infringement.** Here's why:\n\n1. **Substantial copying**: If Ophelia is recognizably your character, this could be reproduction of a substantial part of your work\n2. **Commercial use**: It's in a national ad - clearly commercial\n3. **Moral rights violation**: Your right to be identified as the creator (right of paternity) may have been breached\n4. **No credit given**: This strengthens your moral rights claim\n\n## What You Can Do\n\n**Immediate steps:**\n- **Document everything**: Screenshot the ad, the AI outputs, your original work with timestamps/upload dates\n- **Cease and desist letter**: Send to both the drink company and Synthetic Dreams Corp\n- **Contact the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)** about the ad\n\n**Legal options:**\n- Consult an IP solicitor (many offer free initial consultations)\n- Look into organizations like **DACS** (Design and Artists Copyright Society) or **Own It** for support\n- Consider whether the drink company has deeper pockets than the AI company (they might settle faster)\n\n## Cross-Border Issues\n\nSince Synthetic Dreams Corp is American but you're in the UK:\n- If they operate in the UK, UK law applies to UK activities\n- The ad running in the UK definitely falls under UK jurisdiction\n- You may have claims under both UK and US law\n\n## Reality Check\n\n- This will likely be stressful and potentially expensive\n- The AI training aspect is the weakest part of your claim (legally uncertain)\n- The character use in the ad is your strongest angle\n- Many companies settle rather than fight, especially with clear evidence\n\n**You haven't screwed yourself at all.** You have rights, and you have options. This is exactly the kind of situation copyright law is meant to protect against.\n\nWould you like specific guidance on finding legal support in Manchester, or help drafting a cease and desist letter?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 282, "completion_tokens": 683, "total_tokens": 965}, "latency_s": 14.956777707993751, "request_id": "chatcmpl-912bdbdf-e435-46d6-af5b-1ff04d0be6b8", "raw_response": null}
