However, it does not explicitly state or address the *unresolved difficulty* regarding enforcement for raw materials/intermediate products that are processed in NI before potentially entering the EU. It describes the current system (which attempts to manage this via destination proof) but fails to confirm that the underlying enforcement difficulty regarding complex supply chains remains an unresolved issue, as required by the specific criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4415a72c-e330-4316-a7cb-27df04119e0a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4115, "completion_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 4307}, "latency_s": 0.6910711249802262, "request_id": "YSCVaZm8JqjlnsEP1bugwAM", "raw_response": null}
