The candidate answer explicitly addresses Shirt 2 (the workers' rights advocate shirt) and concludes: 'The key problem for anyone claiming an exception here is that these are commercial products being sold on carts... Additionally, your client may have moral rights (diritti morali) claims... Article 20 gives the author the right to object to any distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work that would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation. Associating the character with a specific political movement without the author's consent could constitute such a prejudicial modification...' While the response focuses heavily on moral rights and the failure of exceptions, the underlying premise that using the character in a modified, politically charged way on merchandise constitutes an infringement of the author's exclusive rights (which includes adaptation/modification rights under Article 18, the basis for derivative works) is clearly established. The analysis confirms it is an infringement under Italian law, which is the core requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"0112e721-9f6a-4b3f-8ed7-559b095bcb35\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4294, "completion_tokens": 280, "total_tokens": 4574}, "latency_s": 1.5417859159933869, "request_id": "B8aUady-FcTV7M8PzpbtcQ", "raw_response": null}
