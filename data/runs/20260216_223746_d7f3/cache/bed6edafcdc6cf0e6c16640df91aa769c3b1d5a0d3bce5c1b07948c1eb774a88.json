The candidate answer explicitly recommends using the UK Patent Box (Step 3) but frames it as applying to 'qualifying income' generated by IP, which is standard UK Patent Box application, not specifically claiming it on a 'service fee' paid to a cost-plus entity. Furthermore, the entire premise of the candidate's recommendation is to move away from the structure implied by the criterion (where the UK entity is purely cost-plus and the residual profit is in Ireland) by suggesting legitimate UK optimisation or genuine functional relocation.
