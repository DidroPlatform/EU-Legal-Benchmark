However, success depends critically on: (1) whether the initial attack by the victim is established; (2) the proportionality of using broken glass; and (3) whether the jury finds the fear of being armed was genuinely held. The law is relatively favourable on honest mistake, but less so on proportionality.\n\n---\n\n## 1. APPLICABLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\n### 1.1 Statutory Basis\n\nSelf-defence in England and Wales is governed by:\n\n- **Common law** (primary source for s.20 OAPA 1861 charges)\n- **Criminal Law Act 1967, s.3** (defence of property/persons)\n- **Self Defence Act 2024** (recent codification – see below)\n\n### 1.2 Self Defence Act 2024\n\nThe Self Defence Act 2024 (in force from 28 January 2024) **codifies** common law self-defence for the first time. It applies to all offences, including s.20 GBH.\n\n**Key statutory test (s.1 SDA 2024):**\n\nA person is not guilty of an offence if they use reasonable force in the circumstances as they *honestly* believed them to be, when:\n\n(a) Acting for a legitimate purpose (self-defence, defence of another, defence of property, prevention of crime, lawful arrest)\n(b) The force used is reasonable in those circumstances\n\n---\n\n## 2. THE TWO-STAGE TEST FOR SELF-DEFENCE\n\n### 2.1 Stage One: Honest Belief in Necessity\n\n**The Test:**\n\nThe defendant must have *honestly* believed that:\n- Force was necessary\n- The circumstances required that level of force\n\n**Critical Point:** The belief need **not** be reasonable, only honest.\n\n**Key Authority: *R v Williams (Gladstone)* [1987] 3 All ER 411**\n\nLord Morris held:\n> \"If the jury came to the conclusion that the defendant believed that he was in immediate danger and that it was necessary for him to defend himself, then provided he only used such force as was reasonable in the circumstances as he believed them to be, he would be entitled to rely on self-defence.\"\n\n**Application to Your Client:**\n\nYour client's honest belief that the victim was armed is **directly relevant** here. Even though the victim was *not* actually armed, if your client genuinely believed this at the time, this supports the self-defence claim.\n\n**Evidential Support Needed:**\n- Client's testimony (credibility crucial)\n- Witness accounts of victim's behaviour/movements\n- Any statements suggesting the victim appeared to be reaching for a weapon\n- Client's demeanour/state of mind (panic, fear)\n\n### 2.2 Stage Two: Reasonableness of Force Used\n\n**The Test:**\n\nOnce honest belief in necessity is established, the force used must be **reasonable in the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be** (not as they actually were).\n\n**Key Authority: *R v Palmer* [1971] 1 All ER 1077**\n\nLord Morris:\n> \"If there has been an attack so that self-defence is reasonably necessary, it will be recognised that a person defending himself cannot weigh to a nicety the exact measure of his necessary defensive action. If the jury thought that in a moment of unexpected anguish a person attacked had only done what he honestly and instinctively thought was necessary, that would be most potent evidence that only reasonable defensive action had been taken.\"\n\n**The \"Moment of Anguish\" Principle:**\n\nThis is crucial for your client. The law recognises that:\n- Defendants need not calculate force with precision\n- Instinctive reactions in emergencies are given latitude\n- The test is not whether a \"reasonable person\" would have used exactly that force, but whether the defendant's response was reasonable *given what they believed*\n\n**Application to Your Client:**\n\nThe use of broken glass is problematic but potentially defensible:\n- If your client believed the victim was armed and posed a lethal threat, using a weapon (broken glass) might be proportionate\n- However, if the victim was unarmed and posed only a moderate threat, using a sharp weapon is likely disproportionate\n- The \"moment of anguish\" principle provides some protection, but only if the response was instinctive, not calculated\n\n---\n\n## 3. HONEST BUT MISTAKEN BELIEF – DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n### 3.1 The Legal Position\n\n**Fundamental Principle:** An honest but mistaken belief in the circumstances does **not** defeat self-defence, provided the force would have been reasonable *if those circumstances had been true*.\n\n**Key Authority: *R v Scarlett* [1994] 98 Cr App R 290**\n\nThe Court held:\n> \"The reasonableness of the defendant's belief is to be judged on the facts as the defendant believed them to be. If the defendant's belief was unreasonable, that is relevant to whether the belief was genuinely held, but does not itself defeat the defence.\"\n\n**Application:**\n\nYour client believed the victim was armed. This belief was mistaken, but if:\n1. The belief was genuinely held, AND\n2. The force used would have been reasonable *if the victim had been armed*\n\n...then the defence succeeds.\n\n### 3.2 Distinguishing Honest Mistake from Recklessness\n\n**Important Caveat:** The honest belief must not be the product of the defendant's own recklessness or negligence.\n\n**Authority: *R v Keane* [2010] EWCA Crim 2514**\n\nThe Court held that a defendant cannot rely on a mistaken belief if:\n- The mistake was caused by the defendant's own intoxication\n- The defendant was reckless as to whether the belief was true\n- The defendant failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain the facts\n\n**Application to Your Client:**\n\nKey questions:\n- Was your client intoxicated? (If so, this weakens the defence)\n- Did the victim's behaviour reasonably suggest they were armed? (If yes, the mistake is more understandable)\n- Did your client have any opportunity to ascertain the truth? (Probably not in a street altercation)\n\n---\n\n## 4. THE REASONABLE FORCE TEST – DETAILED ELEMENTS\n\n### 4.1 Proportionality\n\n**The Test:**\n\nThe force used must be proportionate to the threat posed, *as the defendant believed it to be*.\n\n**Authority: *R v Cresswell* [2006] EWCA Crim 3379**\n\nThe Court identified relevant factors:\n- Nature of the threat\n- Imminence of the threat\n- Availability of alternative responses\n- Whether the defendant was the aggressor\n\n**Application to Your Client:**\n\n**Factors Supporting Proportionality:**\n- Victim initiated the attack\n- Your client feared for his life (high threat level)\n- Street altercation (limited time to assess alternatives)\n- Broken glass was readily available (not a pre-planned weapon)\n\n**Factors Against Proportionality:**\n- Broken glass is a serious weapon\n- If the victim was unarmed, the threat level may not justify a sharp weapon\n- Possible alternative responses (running away, calling police)\n\n### 4.2 Imminence\n\n**The Test:**\n\nThe threat must be imminent. Self-defence does not justify pre-emptive strikes against anticipated future threats.\n\n**Authority: *R v Beckford* [1988] AC 130**\n\nLord Griffiths:\n> \"The force used must be no more than is necessary and must be reasonable in the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.\"\n\n**Application to Your Client:**\n\nThis is likely satisfied:\n- The victim attacked first (imminent threat)\n- Your client struck in response (not pre-emptive)\n- The altercation was ongoing\n\n### 4.3 Necessity\n\n**The Test:**\n\nThe defendant must have believed that force was necessary (not merely desirable or convenient).\n\n**Authority: *R v Owino* [1996] 2 Cr App R 128**\n\nThe Court held that the defendant must have believed:\n- There was no safe alternative\n- Force was the only way to protect themselves\n\n**Application to Your Client:**\n\nQuestions to investigate:\n- Could your client have run away?\n- Could your client have called for help?\n- Was the victim blocking escape routes?\n- Was the attack so sudden that alternatives were unavailable?\n\n---\n\n## 5. BURDEN AND STANDARD OF PROOF\n\n### 5.1 Who Bears the Burden?\n\n**The Position:**\n\nSelf-defence is a **defence**, not an element of the prosecution's case. However:\n\n- The defendant must raise sufficient evidence of self-defence\n- Once raised, the prosecution must disprove it **beyond reasonable doubt**\n- The defendant need not prove self-defence on the balance of probabilities\n\n**Authority: *R v Lobell* [1957] 1 QB 547**\n\n### 5.2 Evidential Burden\n\nYour client must adduce sufficient evidence to raise the defence. This can come from:\n- Your client's own testimony\n- Witness evidence\n- Circumstantial evidence (e.g., injuries consistent with being attacked first)\n\n---\n\n## 6. CASE LAW SYNTHESIS\n\n### 6.1 Key Authorities on Mistaken Belief\n\n| Case | Principle | Application |\n|------|-----------|-------------|\n| *Williams (Gladstone)* | Honest belief in necessity is sufficient; reasonableness is secondary | Your client's belief in being armed is key |\n| *Palmer* | \"Moment of anguish\" – instinctive reactions given latitude | Broken glass use may be defensible as instinctive |\n| *Scarlett* | Mistaken belief doesn't defeat defence if force would be reasonable if belief true | Critical: would broken glass be reasonable if victim *was* armed? |\n| *Keane* | Mistake must not be caused by defendant's own recklessness | Investigate whether client was intoxicated/reckless |\n| *Cresswell* | Proportionality assessed against perceived threat | Victim's apparent threat level is crucial |\n\n### 6.2 The Self Defence Act 2024 – Codification\n\nThe Act codifies these principles but adds important clarifications:\n\n**s.2 SDA 2024 – Factors for Jury:**\n\nIn determining whether force was reasonable, the jury may consider:\n- Nature and imminence of threat\n- Extent of information available to defendant\n- Defendant's role in creating the situation\n- Whether defendant was acting to protect themselves or another\n- Whether defendant was acting to prevent crime or lawful arrest\n\n**Importantly:** The Act preserves the common law position that the defendant's *honest* belief is central.\n\n---\n\n## 7. CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES IN YOUR CLIENT'S CASE\n\n### 7.1 Proportionality Challenge\n\n**The Prosecution's Strongest Argument:**\n\nUsing broken glass is a serious escalation. The prosecution will argue:\n- The victim was unarmed (no actual threat to life)\n- Broken glass is a weapon capable of causing serious injury\n- Your client could have used lesser force (pushing away, running)\n- GBH was the likely result of using broken glass\n\n**Your Response:**\n\n- Your client *believed* the victim was armed\n- In that belief, using a weapon was proportionate\n- The \"moment of anguish\" principle applies\n- Your client did not have time to calculate alternatives\n\n### 7.2 Credibility of Mistaken Belief\n\n**The Prosecution's Challenge:**\n\nThe prosecution will scrutinise whether your client genuinely believed the victim was armed:\n- Why did your client think the victim was armed?\n- Did the victim say anything suggesting they had a weapon?\n- Did the victim's movements suggest they were reaching for a weapon?\n- Is your client's account consistent with witness evidence?\n\n**Your Response:**\n\n- Gather witness evidence supporting the belief\n- Establish the victim's aggressive behaviour\n- Show that the victim's movements were ambiguous\n- Emphasise the stress and fear of the moment\n\n### 7.3 Availability of Alternatives\n\n**The Prosecution's Challenge:**\n\nCould your client have:\n- Run away?\n- Called for help?\n- Used lesser force?\n\n**Your Response:**\n\n- Investigate the location (was escape possible?)\n- Establish the speed of the attack (was there time to consider alternatives?)\n- Show that the victim was blocking escape routes\n- Emphasise the instinctive nature of the response\n\n---\n\n## 8. EVIDENTIAL STRATEGY\n\n### 8.1 Evidence to Gather\n\n**Supporting Self-Defence:**\n\n1. **Witness Statements:**\n   - Did anyone see the victim attack first?\n   - Did anyone see the victim's movements suggesting they were armed?\n   - What was the victim's demeanour/aggression level?\n\n2. **Medical Evidence:**\n   - Your client's injuries (consistent with being attacked first?)\n   - Victim's injuries (consistent with defensive response?)\n\n3. **Scene Evidence:**\n   - Location of the altercation (escape routes?)\n   - Presence of other weapons/objects\n   - CCTV footage (if available)\n\n4. **Your Client's Account:**\n   - Detailed statement of events\n   - Why they believed victim was armed\n   - Their state of mind (fear, panic)\n   - Any prior knowledge of victim\n\n5. **Character Evidence:**\n   - Your client's peaceful character (if admissible)\n   - Victim's violent history (if admissible under s.100 CJA 2003)\n\n### 8.2 Expert Evidence\n\nConsider instructing:\n- **Medical expert:** On injuries and consistency with self-defence narrative\n- **Forensic expert:** On blood spatter, weapon trajectory (if relevant)\n\n---\n\n## 9. LEGAL PROSPECTS – ASSESSMENT\n\n### 9.1 Strengths\n\n1. **Honest Belief in Necessity:** The law is favourable. Even though the victim was not armed, if your client genuinely believed this, the defence is potentially viable.\n\n2. **Victim Attacked First:** This is crucial. If established, it strongly supports self-defence.\n\n3. **\"Moment of Anguish\" Principle:** The law recognises that defendants cannot calculate force precisely in emergencies.\n\n4. **Self Defence Act 2024:** The codification clarifies that honest belief is central, which supports your client.\n\n### 9.2 Weaknesses\n\n1. **Proportionality of Broken Glass:** This is the prosecution's strongest point. Using a sharp weapon against an unarmed person is difficult to justify, even if the defendant believed the person was armed.\n\n2. **Credibility of Mistaken Belief:** The jury must believe your client genuinely thought the victim was armed. This depends on:\n   - Consistency of your client's account\n   - Witness evidence\n   - Victim's behaviour\n\n3. **Availability of Alternatives:** If the jury thinks your client could have run away or used lesser force, this weakens the defence.\n\n### 9.3 Overall Assessment\n\n**Prospects: Moderate to Good**\n\n- If witness evidence supports your client's account of the victim attacking first and appearing armed, prospects are **good**.\n- If your client's account is uncorroborated and relies solely on their testimony, prospects are **moderate**.\n- The mistaken belief element is legally favourable, but the proportionality of using broken glass is problematic.\n\n**Key Determinant:** Witness evidence. If credible witnesses support your client's account, the defence is strong. If not, it is weaker.\n\n---\n\n## 10. RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n### 10.1 Immediate Actions\n\n1. **Obtain Witness Statements:** Urgently identify and interview all potential witnesses.\n\n2. **CCTV Footage:** Request footage from nearby businesses/cameras.\n\n3. **Medical Records:** Obtain your client's medical records showing injuries.\n\n4. **Victim's History:** Investigate the victim's background (prior violence, weapons offences).\n\n5. **Scene Photographs:** Obtain photographs of the location.\n\n### 10.2 Tactical Considerations\n\n1. **Early Guilty Plea vs. Trial:** If witness evidence is weak, consider negotiating a guilty plea to a lesser charge (s.47 ABH). If witness evidence is strong, proceed to trial.\n\n2. **Expert Evidence:** Consider instructing a medical expert to opine on the consistency of injuries with self-defence.\n\n3. **Character Evidence:** If admissible, adduce evidence of your client's peaceful character and the victim's violent history.\n\n### 10.3 Trial Strategy\n\n1. **Emphasise Honest Belief:** Focus on why your client believed the victim was armed.\n\n2. **Victim's Aggression:** Establish that the victim attacked first and behaved aggressively.\n\n3. **Moment of Anguish:** Remind the jury that your client did not have time to calculate force precisely.\n\n4. **Proportionality:** Argue that, given the perceived threat, using broken glass was reasonable.\n\n---\n\n## 11. CONCLUSION\n\nYour client has a viable self-defence claim, particularly given the law's favourable treatment of honest but mistaken beliefs. However, success depends critically on:\n\n1. **Establishing that the victim attacked first** (essential)\n2. **Credible evidence supporting the belief that the victim was armed** (crucial)\n3. **Persuading the jury that broken glass was proportionate to the perceived threat** (difficult but achievable)\n\nThe Self Defence Act 2024 codifies principles favourable to your client, particularly regarding honest belief.
