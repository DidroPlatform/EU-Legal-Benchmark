While the candidate focuses on the *outcome* (sea border/checks) rather than quoting the exact negative phrasing ('no customs or regulatory checks'), it accurately describes the Protocol's core objective regarding the Irish border, which is the essence of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"7316dd03-d67f-4ccb-8ed0-ceee41fa529a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2711, "completion_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 2936}, "latency_s": 0.9253349580103531, "request_id": "pjOVaan2JNuxnsEPg_7zyAU", "raw_response": null}
