{"provider": "vercel_gateway", "model": "vercel_ai_gateway/openai/gpt-5.2", "text": "You’re in a situation where liability can be **shared** across multiple “dutyholders”. In England (including London), after a fatal fire the investigation typically looks at (1) **who was the “Responsible Person”** under fire safety law, (2) **who controlled the risk** that materialised (electrical equipment/maintenance/management), and (3) whether each dutyholder took **all reasonably practicable** steps.\n\nI can’t determine “who is to blame” as a matter of law on these facts alone, but I can set out what you would usually need to evidence to show you took reasonable steps, the main legal frameworks, and how primary responsibility is often analysed in shared-premises cases.\n\n## 1) Key legal frameworks likely in play\n\n### A. Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (FSO)\nApplies to **non-domestic premises** and common parts. Main points:\n- A “**Responsible Person**” (RP) must take **general fire precautions** to ensure safety of employees and relevant persons.\n- Must carry out a **suitable and sufficient fire risk assessment** and keep it under review.\n- Must have **appropriate fire safety arrangements** (maintenance, training, procedures).\n- Must ensure **fire-fighting equipment, detection/alarm, emergency routes/exits** are maintained.\n- **Article 5(3)**: where premises are shared/overlapping control, **each person with control** has duties to the extent of their control.\n- **Article 22**: duty to **co-operate and co-ordinate** with other responsible persons.\n\n**Important:** The FSO does not say “PAT testing” specifically. The duty is outcome-based: maintain systems and prevent fire risks so far as is reasonably practicable. PAT testing is one *common method* of controlling electrical risk, not an automatic legal requirement in every case.\n\n### B. Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HSWA)\nBroader workplace safety duties:\n- **s.2**: duty to employees.\n- **s.3**: duty to non-employees affected by the undertaking (this becomes very relevant with shared buildings and fatalities).\n- Often used as a primary prosecution route after a death if management failings are alleged.\n\n### C. Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999\nRequires risk assessments and **competent assistance**, and implementing preventive/protective measures.\n\n### D. Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (EAWR)\nVery relevant here:\n- Requires electrical systems/equipment to be constructed/maintained to prevent danger.\n- Does **not** mandate PAT by name, but PAT is a widely used way to evidence maintenance/inspection/testing proportionate to risk.\n\n### E. Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 (CMCHA)\nIf the deceased was owed a relevant duty of care and death resulted from a **gross breach** arising from **senior management** failures in how activities were managed/organised. This is fact-sensitive and typically pursued only if there is strong evidence of systemic, senior-level failings.\n\n### F. Occupiers’ Liability (civil) + contractual lease duties\nCivil claims may run alongside criminal/regulatory proceedings, focusing on who controlled the premises and hazards.\n\n## 2) What you would need to demonstrate you took “all reasonable steps” (and what evidence helps)\n\nInvestigators generally want **documentary proof plus practical reality** on the ground. For a shared outbuilding, the biggest scrutiny points tend to be **control**, **coordination with the tenant/neighbor**, and **electrical equipment control**.\n\n### A. Governance / dutyholder structure (FSO Articles 3, 5, 22)\nYou would want to evidence:\n- Who was RP for the outbuilding (and for which areas).\n- Written **allocation of responsibilities** between you (owner/landlord) and the other company (occupier/tenant).\n- A functioning **co-operation and coordination** arrangement: regular meetings, shared actions log, agreed standards.\n\n**Strong evidence**\n- Lease clauses: who maintains electrics, who can bring equipment in, compliance obligations.\n- A “shared building fire safety protocol” signed by both parties.\n- Records of coordination meetings, emails confirming actions.\n\n**Potential weakness**\n- If the building is yours and you retained significant control, regulators may argue you should have imposed and policed minimum electrical safety standards for anything used/stored there, especially if shared occupancy increased risk.\n\n### B. Fire Risk Assessment quality and follow-through (FSO Articles 9, 11)\nTo show the FRA was “suitable and sufficient”, you would want:\n- The FRA document, scope, date, and reviewer competence.\n- Evidence you **implemented** recommendations (not just obtained a report).\n- Review triggers: changes in occupancy, new storage types, new equipment.\n\n**Strong evidence**\n- Actions tracked to completion (purchase orders, photos, sign-offs).\n- Periodic review schedule and update after changes.\n\n**Potential weakness**\n- If the outbuilding was shared and used for storage of manufacturing products, investigators may ask whether the FRA properly addressed:\n  - ignition sources (temporary equipment),\n  - electrical equipment brought in by others,\n  - housekeeping/combustible load,\n  - separation/compartmentation,\n  - detection/alarms and emergency response.\n\n### C. Electrical safety management (EAWR + FSO general precautions)\nEven though “PAT” isn’t always mandatory, after an electrical-fire fatality, you will likely be asked what system you had to ensure electrical equipment used on site was safe.\n\nYou’d want to demonstrate a **risk-based electrical equipment control system**, such as:\n- A site rule that **no portable appliance may be used unless** it is:\n  - formally inspected/tested within an interval appropriate to risk, and\n  - visually checked before use.\n- A documented system for:\n  - registering incoming equipment,\n  - tagging/inspection/testing,\n  - removing defective items,\n  - ensuring competent persons perform checks.\n\n**Strong evidence**\n- Written policy/permit-to-use process for brought-in equipment.\n- Logs of inspections/tests/maintenance (yours and tenant’s).\n- Evidence you audited the tenant’s compliance (spot checks).\n- Competence records for anyone doing electrical inspection/testing.\n\n**Potential weakness**\n- If your system relied entirely on the tenant “doing their own PAT” with no verification, that can be criticised—especially where you owned the structure and had knowledge of shared use.\n\n### D. Fire protection systems & maintenance (FSO Articles 13, 17)\nYou’ll be expected to show:\n- Alarm/detection appropriate for the risk and maintained.\n- Extinguishers (if relevant) maintained.\n- Emergency lighting (if present) maintained.\n- Escape routes, exit signage, and doors managed.\n- Any compartmentation/fire doors not compromised.\n\n**Evidence**\n- Maintenance certificates, service contracts, test logs.\n- Weekly/monthly test records.\n\n### E. Training, procedures, and emergency planning (FSO Articles 15, 21)\n- Fire procedures, evacuation plans, drills.\n- Training records for your employees and—critically—how the shared building occupants were coordinated (e.g., joint drills or agreed procedures).\n\n### F. Control of storage and housekeeping\nIf the outbuilding stored manufacturing products, you may need to evidence:\n- Storage layout controls, separation distances, no-blocking of exits.\n- Limits on ignition sources.\n- Waste management.\n\n## 3) The FRA provider’s omission about PAT testing: how that cuts both ways\n\n### Advantages for you\n- Using a competent third-party assessor supports that you sought professional help and didn’t ignore duties.\n- If the assessor’s scope included the outbuilding and electrical ignition risks, and they failed to flag obvious controls, that may support:\n  - you relied on competent advice, and/or\n  - civil recovery against them (professional negligence) depending on contract/scope.\n\n### Disadvantages / limitations\n- Under the FSO, the duty to ensure the FRA is “suitable and sufficient” remains with the RP. Outsourcing doesn’t outsource legal responsibility.\n- PAT testing is not a universal checklist item; investigators may say a competent RP should still have had an electrical safety management system, especially where third-party equipment is used.\n\nAlso, it will matter whether the FRA scope was “fire precautions” only or whether you had separate electrical safety arrangements under HSWA/EAWR.\n\n## 4) Who is “primarily to blame”? How it’s commonly analysed\n\nWith shared premises, investigators often consider **multiple potential dutyholders**:\n\n### (1) The company that brought in and used the faulty equipment\nThey likely had direct control of the immediate hazard:\n- Duty under HSWA s.2/s.3 and EAWR to ensure equipment is safe/maintained.\n- If they failed to inspect/test/maintain and this caused the fire, they are a strong candidate for primary causative fault.\n\n### (2) You/your company as building owner and (likely) a Responsible Person/controller\nEven if the other company caused the ignition, you can still be exposed if regulators believe you:\n- retained control of the outbuilding (as owner/landlord),\n- failed to set/enforce minimum electrical safety standards for occupiers,\n- failed to coordinate fire safety management under Article 22,\n- had a risk assessment/arrangements that didn’t adequately address foreseeable electrical ignition from portable equipment.\n\n### (3) The fire risk assessor / consultant (usually civil exposure more than criminal)\nCriminal prosecution of consultants is less common but possible if their conduct is grossly negligent and causative; more often it becomes:\n- evidence about adequacy of the FRA, and/or\n- a civil professional negligence claim.\n\n**Reality in many prosecutions/inquests:** The “primary” blame can be attributed to the party whose act/omission most directly caused ignition (the tenant’s equipment management), while the owner/RP may still face enforcement/prosecution for **systemic management failures** that allowed the risk to exist or increased consequences.\n\n## 5) What to prepare now (practically) to show reasonable steps\nGiven active investigations, coordinate with specialist counsel. In terms of evidence you’ll likely want to assemble:\n\n- Lease and any side letters on safety/maintenance responsibilities.\n- FRA(s), scope, assessor competence evidence, and your action completion records.\n- Electrical safety policy covering:\n  - incoming equipment,\n  - inspection/testing regime,\n  - competent persons,\n  - audit/monitoring.\n- Maintenance logs for alarms, emergency lighting, extinguishers, electrical installation inspections (EICR) if applicable.\n- Training/drill records and shared-occupancy coordination records.\n- Any prior complaints, near misses, defects reports and how they were handled.\n- Evidence of how the outbuilding’s use was managed (storage controls, housekeeping).\n\n## 6) A key clarifying point that will change the analysis\nA lot turns on **control** and the exact lease setup. If you answer these, I can give a tighter, more structured view of likely dutyholder allocation:\n\n1) Did you/your company retain responsibility for the outbuilding’s **electrical installation** and maintenance (e.g., fixed wiring, distribution boards)?\n2) Did the tenant have freedom to bring in/use portable equipment without your approval?\n3) Was the deceased an employee of which company (yours, theirs, contractor, visitor)?\n4) Were there any shared fire alarm/detection systems and who maintained them?\n5) Did you ever audit or require evidence of the tenant’s equipment testing/maintenance?\n\nIf you want, I can also provide a checklist framed directly against the FSO Articles (e.g., Art 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 21, 22) and the key HSWA/EAWR duties, with “what inspectors typically look for” and “common failure points” in shared buildings.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 269, "completion_tokens": 2458, "total_tokens": 2727}, "latency_s": 47.595219541020924, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJ2A3PWE994AJ01PBHD65X", "raw_response": null}
