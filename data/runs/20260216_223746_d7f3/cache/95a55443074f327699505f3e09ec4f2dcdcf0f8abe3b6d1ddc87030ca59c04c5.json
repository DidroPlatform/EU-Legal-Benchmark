The candidate answer focuses heavily on Kompetenz-Kompetenz, deference to the tribunal's jurisdictional ruling, and the pro-enforcement bias under the New York Convention, citing scholarly support for procedural autonomy. However, it does not explicitly mention or use the term 'delocalization theory' or the concept that the award exists independently of the seat's legal system as a distinct argument for resisting challenges (which is typically relevant when defending against an annulment action at the seat, though the underlying principle supports enforcement resistance elsewhere). Since the criterion specifically requires mentioning this theory, and it is absent, the criterion is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"0c47ba91-5906-42ff-bc80-b47de8fb0c4e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2036, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 2252}, "latency_s": 0.9819162500207312, "request_id": "4iiVacCUAbyK7M8Ph5iNuAM", "raw_response": null}
