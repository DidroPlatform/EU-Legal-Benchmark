The candidate answer mentions 'Anti-suit injunction risks - the Singapore tribunal might order the English proceedings stopped' under 'Potential Complications'. While this is a risk related to conflicting actions, it does not explicitly list the core risks mentioned in the criterion (multiple court orders, conflicting injunctions, or multiple injunctions in different jurisdictions) as distinct points of conflict arising from parallel proceedings, focusing more on the tribunal's power over the English proceedings.
