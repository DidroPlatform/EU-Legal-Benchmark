FALSE - This description is incomplete. Swiss case law requires THREE cumulative conditions for tax avoidance (Steuerumgehung): (1) the chosen legal form is unusual/inappropriate (objective element), (2) the choice was made solely to save taxes (subjective element), AND (3) the chosen arrangement would actually lead to significant tax savings if accepted (effective element/Effektivitätselement). The statement only mentions two elements and is therefore incorrect.\\n\\nii. This statement claims the 10% threshold for partial taxation (Teilbesteuerungsverfahren) is unconstitutional. The Swiss Federal Supreme Court (BGer) has upheld the 10% threshold as constitutional, finding it serves legitimate purposes. However, the reasoning in the statement about economic double taxation occurring regardless of participation quota is factually correct as an economic observation. The conclusion that it's unconstitutional is debatable - the BGer found it constitutional. This statement appears to be a correct observation about the economic reality but the Swiss Federal Court has ruled the threshold is constitutional, so calling it 'unconstitutional' would be a matter of opinion. Actually, looking more carefully, the statement says the threshold IS unconstitutional - this is false as the BGer upheld it.\\n\\nWait, let me reconsider. The question asks which statements are FALSE.\\n\\niii. FALSE - The first part is correct (degressive tariff violates Leistungsfähigkeitsprinzip), but the conclusion is wrong. The Swiss Federal Supreme Court ruled in BGE 133 I 206 that the degressive tariff in Obwalden is unconstitutional. Economic policy considerations cannot justify the violation. So the statement's conclusion that it's constitutional is false.\\n\\niv. FALSE - Steuerhinterziehung and Steuerbetrug do NOT stand in genuine ideal concurrence (echte Idealkonkurrenz). Steuerhinterziehung is an administrative offense while Steuerbetrug is a criminal offense. They stand in unechte Konkurrenz, and the administrative penalty for Steuerhinterziehung is typically absorbed when Steuerbetrug is prosecuted. Actually, under Swiss law, they can both be pursued but through different proceedings. The statement about 'echte Idealkonkurrenz' is incorrect - they are in unechte Konkurrenz.\\n\\nv. FALSE - This describes the Quellentheorie (source theory), not the Reinvermögenszugangstheorie. The Reinvermögenszugangstheorie defines income as the total increase in net wealth during a period plus consumption. The description given (income that can be used without diminishing wealth) is the source theory.\\n\\nSo false statements: i, iii, iv, v. This corresponds to answer H.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 964, "completion_tokens": 651, "total_tokens": 1615}, "latency_s": 16.977035707997857, "request_id": "chatcmpl-1ce60d39-5493-41e9-b90e-62ee01c754c4", "raw_response": null}
