The candidate answer mentions the DUP boycott and their initial rejection of the WF, and the subsequent 'Safeguarding the Union' deal that brought them back, which covers the 'continued unionist objections' aspect. However, it does not explicitly mention ongoing legal issues, Lords/Parliament enquiries, independent reviews, or current litigation that are central to the criterion's scope beyond the initial political disputes resolved by the February 2024 deal. The answer focuses heavily on explaining the mechanics (green/red lanes, Stormont Brake) rather than the unresolved political/legal fallout.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1aec1b76-0882-40d2-b898-82a67f653e0f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2714, "completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 2916}, "latency_s": 1.8839174169697799, "request_id": "9zOVaY23I9qfnsEPuPyNyAM", "raw_response": null}
