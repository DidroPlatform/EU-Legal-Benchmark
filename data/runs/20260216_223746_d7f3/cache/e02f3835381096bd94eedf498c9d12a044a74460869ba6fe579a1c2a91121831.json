The candidate answer explicitly states the opposite of the incorrect advice described in the criterion. In Section 1, the candidate states: \\\"The mortgage is a **real right** that attaches to the *legal* title. Once the mortgage is **registered**, it becomes a **priority lien** that \\u201cruns with the land\\u201d and is enforceable against anyone who later acquires an interest, even an equitable one.\\\" It further concludes: \\\"If the \\u20ac200\\u202fk mortgage was **properly executed and registered**, the bank will, in most jurisdictions, be able to **realise its debt first**.\\\" This directly aligns with the ground truth that the registered charge has priority over a later equitable claim (like a constructive trust). Therefore, the candidate answer does *not* incorrectly advise that the constructive trust automatically has priority; it correctly advises the opposite.\", \"criterion_id\": \"efe892e8-3336-4d58-afc7-6400db760a08\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4200, "completion_tokens": 284, "total_tokens": 4484}, "latency_s": 14.409918749995995, "request_id": "BOqUaa_rGt_x7M8P3PK2gQE", "raw_response": null}
