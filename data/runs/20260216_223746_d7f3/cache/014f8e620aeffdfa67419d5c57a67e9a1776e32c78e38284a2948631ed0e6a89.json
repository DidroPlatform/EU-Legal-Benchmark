The Starting Point: Why Counterclaims Are Exceptional\n\nInvestor-state arbitration was designed as a one-directional mechanism: the investor activates it; the state defends. Nothing in that architecture naturally accommodates a state bringing its own affirmative claim for relief. The result is that every tribunal confronted with a counterclaim must work through a series of gatekeeping questions, and the burden falls squarely on the respondent state to establish each one.\n\n---\n\n## II. The Three Jurisdictional / Admissibility Tests\n\n### A. Consent (the \"Offer to Arbitrate\" Question)\n\n**Core principle:** Jurisdiction in treaty arbitration rests on the state's standing offer in the BIT and the investor's acceptance of that offer. A counterclaim reverses the polarity—the state is now claimant—so the tribunal must ask whether the instrument of consent extends that far.\n\n**How tribunals approach it:**\n\n1. **Language of the arbitration clause.** Some BITs use narrow language (\"disputes between an investor and a host state concerning an obligation under this Treaty\") that has been read as limiting jurisdiction to investor-initiated claims about treaty breaches. Others use broader language (\"any dispute relating to investments\") that can, in principle, encompass state claims.\n\n2. **Applicable arbitral rules.**\n - **ICSID Convention, Article 46** expressly permits counterclaims that arise \"directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute,\" provided they fall within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the consent of the parties. This gives ICSID tribunals a textual hook.\n - **UNCITRAL Rules (2013 revision, Article 21(3))** provide that a respondent may make a counterclaim \"arising out of the same contract\" or, more broadly, may rely on a claim \"for the purpose of a set-off\" provided it is within the tribunal's jurisdiction. The language \"same contract\" is awkward in treaty arbitration because there is no contract; tribunals have had to reason by analogy to \"same legal relationship\" or \"same investment.\"\n\n3. **Your specific situation.** The Brazil-Poland BIT's dispute-settlement clause is silent on counterclaims. Silence is generally not read as consent. But under UNCITRAL Rules the tribunal may reason that the investor, by commencing arbitration under those Rules, accepted the procedural framework including Article 21(3), and that the state's counterclaim falls within the scope of the broadly worded consent clause—if the BIT's clause is broad enough. This is a genuinely open question and will turn on the exact wording.\n\n**Key cases on consent:**\n\n| Case | Forum | Outcome | Reasoning |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Saluka v. Czech Republic** (UNCITRAL, 2006) | UNCITRAL / Netherlands-Czech BIT | Counterclaim **declined** | Tribunal held the BIT's dispute-settlement clause (\"disputes … concerning an investment\") was limited to investor claims about BIT obligations; it did not extend to state claims under domestic law. |\n| **Roussalis v. Romania** (ICSID, 2011) | ICSID / Greece-Romania BIT | Counterclaim **declined** (majority) | Majority held the BIT's narrow arbitration clause did not cover state counterclaims. Dissent by Judge Rowe argued Article 46 ICSID Convention plus the broad BIT language should suffice. |\n| **Goetz v. Burundi** (ICSID, 1999) | ICSID / Belgium-Luxembourg-Burundi BIT | Counterclaim **admitted** (by agreement) | Parties effectively consented during proceedings; less useful as precedent on the textual question. |\n| **Burlington Resources v. Ecuador** (ICSID, 2017) | ICSID / US-Ecuador BIT | Counterclaim **admitted** | Tribunal found the BIT's broad clause (\"any dispute … relating to an investment\") plus ICSID Article 46 provided jurisdiction. Ecuador was awarded ~$41 million for environmental remediation. |\n| **Perenco v. Ecuador** (ICSID, 2019) | ICSID / France-Ecuador BIT | Counterclaim **admitted** | Similar reasoning; Ecuador awarded ~$54 million on environmental counterclaim. |\n| **Urbaser v. Argentina** (ICSID, 2016) | ICSID / Spain-Argentina BIT | Counterclaim **admitted on jurisdiction, dismissed on merits** | Broad BIT clause (\"any dispute relating to investments\") read as covering counterclaims; tribunal engaged with human-rights obligations of investors but found Argentina had not proved breach. |\n| **Paushok v. Mongolia** (UNCITRAL, 2011) | UNCITRAL / Russia-Mongolia BIT | Counterclaim **declined** | Tribunal found no jurisdictional basis in the BIT for state claims and noted UNCITRAL Rules alone could not create jurisdiction absent consent in the treaty. |\n\n**Practical takeaway for your case:** Under UNCITRAL Rules with a silent BIT, the weight of authority leans against jurisdiction over counterclaims, but the result is not foreordained—it depends on how broadly the BIT's dispute clause is drafted and whether the tribunal is willing to read the investor's acceptance of UNCITRAL Rules as procedural consent to counterclaims within the scope of the treaty's subject-matter.\n\n---\n\n### B. Connection / Nexus with the Investor's Claim\n\nEven where consent is found, tribunals require a sufficient factual and legal connection between the counterclaim and the primary claim.\n\n**The standard formulations:**\n\n- **ICSID Article 46:** \"directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute.\"\n- **UNCITRAL Article 21(3):** \"arising out of the same contract\" (read analogically as the same investment relationship).\n- **Scholarly / tribunal gloss:** The counterclaim must arise from the same investment, the same facts, or the same legal relationship; it should not be a free-standing claim that the state could (and ordinarily would) pursue in its own courts.\n\n**How this plays out in practice:**\n\n- In **Burlington** and **Perenco**, the environmental damage counterclaims were intimately connected with the same oil-production operations that were the subject of the expropriation claims. The nexus was obvious.\n- In **Saluka**, even if the tribunal had found consent, the Czech Republic's counterclaim (for damages arising from the investor's alleged mismanagement of a bank) was arguably connected, but the tribunal never reached the nexus analysis.\n- In **Urbaser**, Argentina's counterclaim (failure to provide universal water access) was connected to the same concession that was the subject of the investor's fair-and-equitable-treatment claim.\n\n**Your situation:** Poland's counterclaim alleges that the farm's construction damaged protected habitats. If the investor's primary claim concerns the same farm (e.g., expropriation or regulatory interference with the farm), the factual nexus is strong. This element is probably the easiest for Poland to satisfy.\n\n---\n\n### C. Applicable Law (Can the Tribunal Apply Domestic Environmental Law?)\n\nThis is often the most analytically difficult hurdle.\n\n**The problem:** The BIT typically gives the tribunal jurisdiction over disputes \"concerning obligations under this Agreement.\" A counterclaim grounded in domestic environmental law is not, on its face, a claim about a BIT obligation. So the state must show either:\n\n1. **The BIT itself incorporates or references domestic law obligations** (some newer treaties do—e.g., provisions requiring investors to comply with host-state law, or \"corporate social responsibility\" clauses). If the Brazil-Poland BIT contains such a clause, Poland's position is significantly stronger.\n\n2. **The applicable-law clause is broad enough.** Many BITs say the tribunal shall apply the BIT, applicable rules of international law, and the law of the host state. If domestic law is part of the applicable law, the tribunal arguably can adjudicate a domestic-law counterclaim—provided the consent and nexus hurdles are cleared.\n\n3. **International law itself imposes environmental obligations on the investor.** This was Argentina's argument in **Urbaser** (human right to water). The tribunal accepted in principle that international law could impose obligations on corporations but found Argentina had not identified a sufficiently specific norm. This pathway remains largely theoretical but is developing.\n\n**Key cases on applicable law:**\n\n- **Saluka:** Tribunal emphasized that the BIT's dispute clause was limited to BIT obligations, effectively foreclosing domestic-law counterclaims.\n- **Burlington / Perenco:** Tribunals applied Ecuadorian environmental law as part of the applicable law under the BIT's applicable-law clause and the ICSID Convention's Article 42 (which defaults to host-state law plus applicable international law).\n- **Urbaser:** Tribunal was willing to look at international human-rights law as a source of investor obligations but found the specific norm insufficiently crystallized.\n- **David Aven v. Costa Rica** (ICSID, DR-CAFTA, 2018): Tribunal considered Costa Rica's environmental counterclaim under DR-CAFTA Article 10.20(6), which expressly permits counterclaims. It ultimately declined the counterclaim on the merits but the jurisdictional pathway was clear because the treaty text was explicit.\n\n**Your situation:** You need to examine (a) whether the Brazil-Poland BIT has an applicable-law clause that includes domestic law, and (b) whether there is any provision referencing investor obligations or compliance with host-state law. If the BIT is a relatively older, lean instrument (as many Central/Eastern European BITs are), it likely lacks such provisions, making it harder for Poland to ground a domestic-environmental-law counterclaim within the tribunal's mandate.\n\n---\n\n## III. Synthesis: A Decision-Tree for Your Case\n\n```\n1. Does the BIT's dispute-settlement clause encompass\n state-initiated claims (counterclaims)?\n │\n ├─ Narrow clause (\"disputes concerning obligations\n │ under this Treaty\") → Likely NO jurisdiction\n │ (Saluka, Roussalis, Paushok line)\n │\n └─ Broad clause (\"any dispute relating to investments\")\n │\n 2. Do the UNCITRAL Rules supply a procedural\n vehicle for the counterclaim?\n │\n ├─ Art. 21(3) permits counterclaims \"arising\n │ out of the same contract/relationship\"\n │ → Arguable YES, but rules alone cannot\n │ create jurisdiction absent treaty consent\n │\n 3. Is there a sufficient factual/legal nexus\n between the counterclaim and the primary claim?\n │\n ├─ Same investment, same facts → YES\n │\n 4. Can the tribunal apply domestic environmental\n law as the substantive basis for the counterclaim?\n │\n ├─ BIT applicable-law clause includes host-state\n │ law, or BIT contains investor-obligation\n │ provisions → Stronger basis\n │\n └─ BIT silent or limited to treaty obligations\n → Weaker basis (but cf. Burlington/Perenco\n under ICSID Art. 42)\n```\n\n---\n\n## IV. Practical Observations for Briefing the Client\n\n1. **The trend is toward greater receptivity**, especially in ICSID arbitration and under newer treaties. Burlington, Perenco, and Urbaser represent a clear shift from the near-automatic rejection seen in Saluka and Roussalis. But the UNCITRAL / silent-BIT context is less favorable to the state.\n\n2. **The investor has strong procedural objections** in your scenario:\n - The BIT is silent on counterclaims.\n - UNCITRAL Rules Article 21(3) was drafted for commercial arbitration and its application in treaty arbitration is contested.\n - Domestic environmental law may fall outside the tribunal's applicable-law mandate.\n\n3. **But the investor should not be complacent.** If the BIT's dispute clause is broadly worded, a progressive tribunal could follow the Burlington/Perenco reasoning. The factual nexus (same farm, same construction) is strong. And there is a growing policy expectation—reflected in UNCITRAL Working Group III discussions on ISDS reform—that states should be able to raise environmental and human-rights counterclaims.\n\n4. **Strategic considerations:**\n - Even if the counterclaim is dismissed on jurisdiction, the underlying environmental allegations may resurface as a defense to quantum (contributory fault, illegality, unclean hands).\n - The investor should assess its actual environmental exposure under Polish law independently of the arbitration, because Poland can always pursue the claim in its own courts.\n - If the tribunal bifurcates jurisdiction, the counterclaim issue could add significant time and cost.\n\n5. **Drafting the jurisdictional objection:** The strongest arguments for the investor are (a) no consent in the BIT, (b) UNCITRAL Rules cannot independently create jurisdiction, and (c) domestic environmental law is outside the tribunal's applicable-law mandate. Cite **Saluka**, **Paushok**, and the **Roussalis** majority. Distinguish **Burlington** and **Perenco** on the basis that those cases involved ICSID Article 46 and broader BIT clauses.\n\n---\n\nI should flag that the precise wording of the Brazil-Poland BIT's arbitration clause and applicable-law provision will be dispositive on several of these points—I would want to parse that language carefully before finalizing the brief.
