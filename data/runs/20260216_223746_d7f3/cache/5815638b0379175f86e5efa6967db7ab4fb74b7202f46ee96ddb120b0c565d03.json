The response mentions Section 44 generally, stating that courts retain power to grant interim measures in support of arbitration (Principle 1 under Key Principles). However, it does not specifically cite or discuss subsection 44(5), which deals with the court's power to grant relief where the tribunal has no power or is unable to act effectively.
