Statement ii is incorrect - Switzerland has no Prime Minister; the Federal Council has 7 members with a rotating ceremonial President, no special executive powers, and cannot dissolve the Federal Assembly. Statement iii is incorrect - penal orders in Swiss law are limited to sentences up to 6 months, not 12 months.
