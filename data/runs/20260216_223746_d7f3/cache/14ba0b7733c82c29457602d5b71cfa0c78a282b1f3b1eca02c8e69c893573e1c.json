While the candidate answer extensively discusses the 'unreasonable interference' test, which is the core of nuisance law, and mentions balancing factors like locality, duration, and time of day, it never explicitly states or frames the law using the principle of 'good neighbourliness' (often associated with cases like *Bamford v Turnley* or the general balancing act required in nuisance). The closest concept mentioned is the balancing of factors to determine 'unreasonable interference,' but the specific legal phrasing required by the criterion is absent.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d83e8fa0-97e2-48b9-a675-1d498047d617\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2446, "completion_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 2625}, "latency_s": 1.6360127500083763, "request_id": "Bb6UaYjlNb3knsEP-_zhiQI", "raw_response": null}
