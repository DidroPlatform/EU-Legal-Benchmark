However, the reference answer strongly suggests a focus on the classic US/UK corporate law debate (Friedman vs. Stakeholder/Social Institution models) and explicitly mentions concepts like 'nexus of contracts,' 'Parkinson\\u2019s idea of social institution model,' and a specific New Jersey Supreme Court case. The candidate's answer completely ignores these core reference points. While the candidate disagrees with the proposition, their explanation relies entirely on specific Swiss statutory law (CO, Federal Constitution) rather than engaging with the theoretical frameworks (Shareholder Wealth Maximization vs. Social Institution Model/Stakeholder Theory) that the reference answer mandates for discussion. The structure and content do not align with the expected discussion points derived from the reference answer.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.45}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1249, "completion_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 1456}, "latency_s": 1.0906062920112163, "request_id": "oOSUabjvLPWT28oP4MbLwA0", "raw_response": null}
