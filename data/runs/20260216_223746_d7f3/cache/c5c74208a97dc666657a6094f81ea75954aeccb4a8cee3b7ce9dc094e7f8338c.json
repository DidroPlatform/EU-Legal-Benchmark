He published \"A Memory of Solferino\" in 1862 after witnessing the battle's aftermath. This statement is **incorrect** - it wrongly attributes his influence to the American Civil War.\n\n**Statement ii**: According to Swiss constitutional law, popular initiatives that violate mandatory provisions of international law (jus cogens) must be declared invalid. However, for other international law violations (like ECHR), the Federal Assembly cannot simply declare them invalid - they must be put to vote. The people decide, though this creates tension with international obligations. This statement is **incorrect** - it overstates the Federal Assembly's power to reject initiatives.\n\n**Statement iii**: In Swiss criminal law, intention (Vorsatz/dol) is defined in the general part of the Criminal Code (Article 12), not the specific part. The specific part deals with individual offenses. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**Statement iv**: Constitutional principles of administrative law in the Federal Constitution apply to both the Confederation AND the cantons. The cantons are bound by federal constitutional principles. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\nAll four statements (i, ii, iii, and iv) are incorrect.\n\n{\"answer\": \"H\", \"reasoning\": \"All statements are incorrect: (i) Dunant was influenced by Solferino, not the American Civil War; (ii) initiatives violating ECHR cannot simply be declared invalid by Federal Assembly; (iii) intention is defined in the general part, not specific part of Criminal Code; (iv) constitutional principles apply to both Confederation and cantons.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 346, "completion_tokens": 386, "total_tokens": 732}, "latency_s": 9.912294084002497, "request_id": "chatcmpl-0b6b0598-4274-4094-a5dc-489e0515d321", "raw_response": null}
