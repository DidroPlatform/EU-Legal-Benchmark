{"provider": "nim", "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", "text": " First, take a breath. **You have not screwed yourself.** Copyright protection in the UK is automatic the moment you create original work—you do not need to register anything (unlike the US, where registration unlocks certain damages). Being \"not that big yet\" changes nothing about your rights.\n\nHowever, the AI element makes this legally complex and currently unsettled. Here is a realistic breakdown of where you stand under UK law:\n\n## 1. The Scraping/Training (The \"Input\")\nUnder UK law, **Text and Data Mining (TDM)**—which includes scraping content to train AI—became significantly broader in 2023. Currently, UK law permits commercial TDM **unless** the rights holder has explicitly opted out (e.g., via robots.txt, terms of service, or a clear reservation of rights).\n\n*If you did not have an opt-out notice on your website when they scraped the work*, the company may have a defence that their training was lawful under the UK TDM exception. This is controversial and untested in court, but it is the current legal landscape.\n\n**Crucially:** This only covers the *act of training*. It does not automatically give them the right to reproduce your actual work or characters in their outputs.\n\n## 2. The Generated Character in the Advert (The \"Output\")\nThis is your strongest ground. If the generated image of \"Ophelia\" is **substantially similar** to your original character (same distinctive features, costume, pose, composition), this is likely **copyright infringement** regardless of how it was made.\n\nUnder the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, copying can be indirect (AI generation doesn't magically clean the slate). If a UK court finds the output reproduces a \"substantial part\" of your original artistic work, both the user and potentially the AI company could be liable.\n\n**Character Protection:** Distinctive characters in graphic novels receive protection in the UK. If Ophelia has specific, original visual attributes (unique costume design, silhouette, markings), she is protected as an artistic work, not just as a generic idea.\n\n## 3. The Missing Credit (Moral Rights)\nYou mentioned your name wasn't credited. In the UK, you have a **\"right of paternity\"** (moral right to be identified as the author). **However**, this right must be **asserted**—usually in writing (e.g., \"© [Your Name], 2024. The author asserts their moral rights.\")—before the infringement occurs. If you didn't assert this right on the posted pages, you might not be able to claim for the lack of attribution, though you can still claim for the economic infringement (the copying itself).\n\n## 4. The Advert & \"Passing Off\"\nIf the advert suggests you endorsed the drink or created the image, you may also have a claim for **\"passing off\"** or false endorsement under UK law, separate from copyright. This requires showing you have goodwill/reputation (which your online presence may establish) and that the public might be confused into thinking you authorised the use.\n\n## What You Should Do Immediately\n\n**Preserve Evidence:** Screenshot everything—the original Ophelia pages (with dates), the generated image, the advert, the credits shown, and any evidence the AI model was trained on your work (if the company admitted it or if you can show your work in datasets).\n\n**Check Your Server Logs/Metadata:** If you can prove the scraping happened from UK servers, UK law applies more cleanly. If they scraped from the US, US \"Fair Use\" doctrine becomes relevant (currently being tested in cases like *Andersen v. Stability AI*).\n\n**Assert Your Rights Now:** Put a notice on your current/future work immediately:  \n*\"© [Your Full Name] [Year]. All rights reserved. No text and data mining authorisation is granted. The author hereby asserts their moral right to be identified as the author of this work under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.\"*  \nThis protects future scrapes.\n\n**Do Not Delay:** Copyright claims have limitation periods (6 years in UK civil cases), but evidence disappears fast.\n\n## The Hard Truth\nYou likely have a case regarding the **advert image itself** if it copies Ophelia's distinctive features. The **training** issue is murkier and depends on whether you had opt-out mechanisms in place.\n\n**You need a solicitor.** Look for a UK Intellectual Property solicitor experienced in digital rights and AI (firms like Bird & Bird, Pinsent Masons, or smaller boutique IP practices). Many offer initial consultations. If you cannot afford private litigation, organizations like **The Society of Authors** or **The AOI (Association of Illustrators)** offer legal advice and sometimes collective action support.\n\nYou are not powerless, but this is a rapidly evolving area of law where the specifics of how \"Ophelia\" was rendered in the AI output will determine everything.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a solicitor.
