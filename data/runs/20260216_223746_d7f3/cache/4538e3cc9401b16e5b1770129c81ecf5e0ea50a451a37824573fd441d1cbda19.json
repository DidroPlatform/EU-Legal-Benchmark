The candidate answer addresses the necessity limb of self-defence (Limb 1) by stating: \\\"The first question is whether the Defendant genuinely (honestly) believed that it was necessary to use force to defend himself.\\\" This directly addresses the requirement that force must be used to avert an attack. Furthermore, the analysis of the facts under Section III.A focuses on the Defendant's belief that he was attacked first and feared for his life, which establishes the necessary trigger (imminent or immediately apprehended attack) required for the defence to be engaged. The entire structure of the analysis confirms that the defence is contingent upon the belief in the necessity to defend against an attack.\", \"criterion_id\": \"74ca3b09-c13e-4143-b0da-ede48e93caee\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4292, "completion_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 4516}, "latency_s": 1.0601587500132155, "request_id": "50mUabzcHrbzxs0P7LC32Q0", "raw_response": null}
