It is implemented through a series of **Joint Committee Decisions** and **EU regulations** that amend the operation of the Protocol. The core legal instruments are:\n\n- **Joint Committee Decision No 1/2023** of 24 March 2023, laying down arrangements relating to the Windsor Framework\n- **Joint Committee Decision No 2/2023** of 24 March 2023, amending the Protocol specifically on customs and movement of goods\n- Several **EU regulations**, most notably **Regulation (EU) 2023/1231** (on retail movements of food from GB to NI) and **Regulation (EU) 2023/1128** (on plant health), both adopted 14 June 2023\n- **UK domestic legislation**, principally the **Windsor Framework (Democratic Scrutiny) Regulations 2024** (SI 2024/27) and amendments to the Internal Market Act 2020\n\nThe Protocol itself remains the treaty-level instrument; the Windsor Framework modifies its practical operation rather than replacing it wholesale.\n\n---\n\n## The Core Architecture: How NI Sits in \"Both Markets\"\n\nYour student's characterisation (via Sinn Féin) is essentially correct, and it is also the source of every problem.\n\nUnder the Protocol as modified by the Windsor Framework, Northern Ireland occupies a unique legal position:\n\n1. **NI remains part of the UK's customs territory** (Article 4 of the Protocol).\n2. **NI continues to apply a subset of EU single market rules**, specifically those relating to goods — EU regulations on product standards, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) rules, state aid rules as they affect goods trade, and VAT/excise rules on goods (Annex 2 of the Protocol, which lists the applicable EU law).\n3. **NI has unfettered access to the GB market** for goods originating in or in free circulation in NI (enshrined in Section 45 of the UK Internal Market Act 2020, as amended).\n4. **NI goods can circulate into the EU single market** because NI applies the relevant EU rules — meaning goods produced in NI to EU standards can cross into Ireland (and thus the rest of the EU) without border checks.\n\nSo yes: NI is simultaneously inside the UK customs territory and inside the EU single market for goods. This is precisely the \"best of both worlds\" framing that Sinn Féin and some business groups have used, and precisely the constitutional abomination that the DUP identified.\n\n---\n\n## Your Central Question: Why Isn't NI Just a Spaceport?\n\nThis is the right question. If NI is in both markets, what stops someone shipping goods into NI under UK customs terms and then moving them across the border into Ireland and the EU single market, circumventing EU tariffs, standards, and controls?\n\nThe answer is the **lane system** — the Framework's central operational mechanism.\n\n### The Green Lane and Red Lane\n\nThe Windsor Framework replaced the original Protocol's arrangement (which treated essentially all GB-to-NI goods movements as requiring full customs declarations and SPS checks) with a **two-lane system**:\n\n- **The Green Lane (now formally called the \"UK Internal Market lane\")**: For goods moving from GB to NI that are destined to remain in NI (or move on to the rest of the UK). These goods face **radically simplified procedures** — no customs declarations in the full sense, no routine SPS checks, no tariffs. Traders must be registered in the **UK Trusted Trader Scheme** (an enhanced version of the earlier UKTS, provided for in Joint Committee Decision No 1/2023, Annex I).\n\n- **The Red Lane (the \"normal lane\")**: For goods that are, or are at risk of being, moved into the EU single market (i.e., across the border into Ireland). These face **full EU customs procedures**, including declarations, duties at EU rates, and regulatory checks.\n\n### The \"At Risk\" Test — and Where the Burden Falls\n\nThis is the critical piece your student asked about, and it has changed significantly.\n\n**Under the original Protocol (Article 5(2) and Joint Committee Decision No 1/2020 of 17 December 2020):**\n\nA good was considered \"at risk\" of entering the EU single market unless it could be shown that it would not be \"subject to commercial processing in Northern Ireland\" and met certain criteria. The default was essentially that **goods were presumed at risk** unless the trader could demonstrate otherwise. This was the regime that caused enormous friction.\n\n**Under the Windsor Framework (Joint Committee Decision No 1/2023, replacing Decision No 1/2020):**\n\nThe presumption is **reversed for goods moving through the Green Lane**. Goods moved by a registered trusted trader through the Green Lane are **presumed NOT to be at risk** of entering the EU single market. The burden shifts: it is now for the authorities (in practice, UK Border Force acting under the framework, with EU oversight rights) to demonstrate that a specific consignment is at risk, rather than for the trader to prove it is not.\n\nHowever — and this is important — this reversed presumption **only applies to goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland through the Green Lane via a trusted trader**. It does not apply to:\n\n- Goods entering the Red Lane (full EU procedures apply, no presumption in the trader's favour)\n- Goods arriving in NI directly from third countries\n\n### Third Country Goods (Your China Example)\n\nThis is where the architecture gets less generous.\n\n**Goods arriving in NI directly from a third country (say, China) are NOT covered by the Green Lane.** The Green Lane is specifically for GB-to-NI movements. Goods from third countries entering NI are subject to:\n\n- **EU customs procedures** under the Union Customs Code (Regulation (EU) No 952/2013), because NI applies EU customs rules for goods that may enter the single market\n- **UK customs procedures** insofar as NI is part of the UK customs territory\n\nIn practice, this means third-country goods arriving directly in NI face **EU-rate tariffs and full customs controls** at the point of entry. They are treated, for customs purposes, as entering the EU. If the goods are destined to remain in the UK (NI or GB), the trader can seek a **reimbursement or waiver** of the EU-rate tariff if the UK tariff is lower, but the procedural burden is on the trader.\n\nSo for your China scenario: goods shipped directly from China to Belfast are **not** presumed to be safe for the UK internal market and waved through. They hit EU customs controls. The \"spaceport\" risk is more acute for goods that enter GB first (under UK customs terms, potentially with lower tariffs or different standards), and then someone tries to move them through NI into the EU. The Green Lane/Red Lane system and the trusted trader scheme are the safeguards against that.\n\n### What Actual Safeguards Exist Against Abuse?\n\n1. **The Trusted Trader Scheme**: Only registered traders can use the Green Lane. Registration requires the trader to demonstrate that their supply chain ends in NI or GB. HMRC administers this. Abuse can lead to removal from the scheme and penalties.\n\n2. **Data sharing and real-time monitoring**: Under Joint Committee Decision No 1/2023, the UK provides the EU with real-time access to customs and trade data for goods moving through the Green Lane. The EU can monitor flows and flag concerns.\n\n3. **EU safeguard rights**: The EU retains the right, under Article 5 of the Protocol as modified, to request that specific goods or categories of goods be moved to the Red Lane if there is evidence of diversion risk. There is a Joint Consultative Working Group and the Joint Committee itself as escalation mechanisms.\n\n4. **Physical checks on a risk basis**: While routine SPS and customs checks are eliminated for Green Lane goods, UK authorities conduct **risk-based checks and inspections** at NI ports. The EU has the right to send officials to observe (not conduct) these checks — a point of significant political sensitivity.\n\n5. **Labelling requirements**: Under the Framework, goods moving through the Green Lane to NI must carry a \"Not for EU\" label (for food products, this is specified in Regulation (EU) 2023/1231, Article 7). This is meant to prevent onward sale into the Republic of Ireland. Whether a label on a sausage is a meaningful safeguard against organised customs fraud is a question I leave to your professional judgment.\n\n---\n\n## The Stormont Brake\n\n### What It Is\n\nThe **Stormont Brake** is a mechanism introduced by the Windsor Framework, given domestic legal effect by the **Windsor Framework (Democratic Scrutiny) Regulations 2024 (SI 2024/27)**, and provided for in the amended Article 13(3a) of the Protocol (inserted by Joint Committee Decision No 2/2023).\n\nIt works as follows:\n\n- When the EU proposes to **amend or replace** an EU law that applies to NI under Annex 2 of the Protocol, the NI Assembly can trigger the Stormont Brake.\n- The trigger requires **30 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) from at least two parties**, using a **Petition of Concern-style mechanism** (cross-community support is not formally required, but the two-party threshold is designed to ensure it is not a single-party veto).\n- Once triggered, the UK government is obligated to **notify the Joint Committee** that the new or amended EU law should not apply in NI.\n- The Joint Committee then discusses the matter. If no resolution is found, the UK can **unilaterally disapply** the EU measure in NI, but the EU then has the right to take **\"appropriate remedial measures\"** (i.e., proportionate retaliation, potentially including suspending parts of the trade arrangements).\n\n### What It Is Not\n\nIt is **not** a unilateral NI veto on EU law. It is a mechanism that allows NI to raise an objection, which the UK government then pursues diplomatically, with the backstop being unilateral UK action that carries consequences. It has never been used.\n\n### The DUP Boycott\n\nThe DUP's boycott of the Assembly (which ran from February 2022 to February 2024) was **not primarily about the Stormont Brake**, because the Brake did not yet exist for most of the boycott period. The boycott was about the **original Northern Ireland Protocol** as a whole.\n\nThe DUP's objections were constitutional and practical:\n\n1. **Constitutional**: The Protocol placed NI under EU single market rules without democratic consent, creating what the DUP described as an \"Irish Sea border\" — regulatory and customs barriers between NI and the rest of the UK. This, they argued, undermined NI's place in the Union and violated the Acts of Union 1800 (specifically Article VI, guaranteeing equal trading rights across the UK — an argument the courts addressed in *Allister & Others v Secretary of State for Northern Ireland* [2023] UKSC 5, where the Supreme Court held that the Protocol was lawful under the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which had modified the Acts of Union by necessary implication).\n\n2. **Practical**: Businesses in NI faced enormous bureaucratic burdens moving goods from GB, with full customs declarations and SPS checks on everyday items.\n\n3. **Democratic deficit**: EU laws would apply in NI with no NI (or UK) input into their making.\n\nThe DUP used the mechanism under the **Northern Ireland (Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern) Act 2022** — which required the nomination of both a First Minister and deputy First Minister for the Executive to function — to collapse the Executive by refusing to nominate a First Minister. Since Sinn Féin had won the most seats in the 2022 Assembly election and nominated the First Minister (Michelle O'Neill), the DUP's refusal to nominate a deputy First Minister meant no Executive could form.\n\nThe DUP returned to the Assembly in **February 2024** after the UK government passed the **Windsor Framework (Democratic Scrutiny) Regulations 2024** and made further commitments in the **\"Safeguarding the Union\" Command Paper (CP 1021, January 2024)**. This paper included:\n\n- The Stormont Brake mechanism\n- Legislation to affirm NI's place in the UK internal market (amendments to the Internal Market Act 2020)\n- An \"InterMinisterial Group\" giving NI a voice on EU rules applying there\n- Commitments on the operation of the Green Lane\n\nWhether the DUP secured enough to justify a two-year boycott is a matter of political opinion. Many of their own voters and members felt they did not.\n\n---\n\n## Summary for Your Student\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|---|---|\n| Is NI in both markets? | Yes — UK customs territory + EU single market for goods |\n| What stops it being a free transit point? | Green Lane/Red Lane system, Trusted Trader Scheme, data sharing, EU monitoring rights, \"Not for EU\" labelling |\n| Where is the burden of proof on \"at risk\" goods? | **Reversed** for Green Lane goods (presumed NOT at risk).
