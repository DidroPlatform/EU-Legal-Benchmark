Section 5.3, specifically addressing a shipment from China to NI, states: 'Because NI remains aligned with the EU customs territory, a Chinese-origin shipment that lands in NI is treated as an EU import.' It further explains that if the goods are on the EU risk register, the EU can require a full customs declaration and physical checks before the goods can leave NI for GB, which aligns with the concept of being subject to EU rules/tariffs (red lane treatment for onward movement to GB). The core premise that NI imports from third countries are treated as EU imports is clearly stated.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f57b3384-02c0-47f0-b614-11a03bd257cb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3956, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 4166}, "latency_s": 24.29163516598055, "request_id": "gfKUaczREo65kdUPzNPImQM", "raw_response": null}
