This satisfies the criterion that the response states the purpose of the FTC limitation is to ensure foreign taxes on one type of income cannot offset U.S. tax on another, by discussing the basket limitations imposed by Section 904.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9620eeef-a685-4f67-8c7e-caaed3794617\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4356, "completion_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 4592}, "latency_s": 0.9232086659758352, "request_id": "rMWUabPrOMKHnsEPkpLbwQ8", "raw_response": null}
