It explicitly states that the job title 'Marketing Manager' does not automatically equate to 'Dirigente' and classification depends on actual powers, contrasting this with the UK where no such statutory definition exists.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4b0dbe00-ea3f-4e16-b69d-bef7676337a6\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3804, "completion_tokens": 157, "total_tokens": 3961}, "latency_s": 0.8673066250048578, "request_id": "dLeUaazJO73ukdUPjeSHsAM", "raw_response": null}
