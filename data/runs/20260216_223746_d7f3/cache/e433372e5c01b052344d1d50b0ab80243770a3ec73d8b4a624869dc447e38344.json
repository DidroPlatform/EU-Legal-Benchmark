The response explicitly lists KPI #7, 'Independent Tax-Compliance Review,' which is performed by 'External or internal audit' and measures 'Number of audit findings (severity-weighted).' This directly satisfies the requirement for verification by an independent assurance function. Furthermore, KPI #2 ('Document completeness score') and KPI #9 ('Data-reconciliation error rate') are subject to 'Quarterly audit of repository metadata' or 'Automated reconciliation scripts,' which are monitoring activities often overseen or validated by Internal Audit to preserve control integrity and objectivity. The overall framework structure, especially the inclusion of an annual external audit and the explicit mention of Internal Audit signing off on the quarterly package, confirms the presence of verification by an independent function.\", \"criterion_id\": \"433fb637-b97d-41e1-9b0b-5540527c3a48\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3784, "completion_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 4016}, "latency_s": 21.808148792013526, "request_id": "uPCUadnsJ5uZ28oPjdqtsAQ", "raw_response": null}
