The response correctly identifies the governing statute as s. 76 CJIA 2008 (Section II.A.(i)) and discusses the general reasonableness test under s. 76(6) (using the term 'disproportionate'). Crucially, the response does not mention s. 76(5A) at all, which deals specifically with the 'grossly disproportionate' test applicable only to householder cases. By focusing only on the general principles applicable to street altercations (s. 76(6) 'disproportionate'), the response implicitly confirms that the higher 'grossly disproportionate' threshold of s. 76(5A) is not the standard to be applied here, thereby satisfying the requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2f43efa2-6cd5-48c6-b8fd-1035de7d7d10\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4291, "completion_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 4532}, "latency_s": 1.8614156669937074, "request_id": "_EmUafKNEoDXvdIPm5KRmQE", "raw_response": null}
