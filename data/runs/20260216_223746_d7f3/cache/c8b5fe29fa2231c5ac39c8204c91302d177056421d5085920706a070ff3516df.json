(ii) Under Swiss law, a popular initiative violating jus cogens (peremptory norms of international law) is declared invalid, but violation of the ECHR alone is not sufficient grounds for invalidation by the Federal Assembly — such initiatives can still be put to a vote. (iii) Intention (intent/Vorsatz) is defined in the general part of the Swiss Criminal Code (Art. 12), not the specific part. (iv) The constitutional principles of administrative law (Art. 5, Art. 9, etc. of the Federal Constitution) apply to all levels of government, including cantons, not just the confederation.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 347, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 570}, "latency_s": 5.417948542017257, "request_id": "chatcmpl-cc904095-da93-4927-b9f6-a80b81c0815d", "raw_response": null}
