Let me give you the actual mechanics.\n\n## The Core Problem the Framework Tried to Solve\n\nPost-Brexit, the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol (2020) created a hard choice: either a land border on the island (politically impossible) or regulatory checks between GB and NI (economically disruptive). The Protocol chose the latter—NI stayed aligned with EU rules for goods.\n\nThis meant NI businesses faced dual compliance costs and GB goods faced friction. The DUP opposed it as a \"sea border\" separating NI from the rest of the UK.\n\n## What the Windsor Framework Actually Changed\n\n**Adopted:** 27 February 2023 (the \"Windsor Framework\" is the political agreement; the legal instrument is the **Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland (Amendment) 2023**)\n\nThe Framework introduced a **\"green lane/red lane\" system**:\n\n- **Green lane**: Goods staying in NI, moving between NI and GB, or moving GB→NI with no EU-destined purpose. These face minimal checks.\n- **Red lane**: Goods at risk of entering the EU market. These face full EU customs and regulatory checks.\n\n## The Actual Safeguards: The \"Stormont Brake\"\n\nThis is what the DUP boycott was about.\n\n**The Stormont Brake** (Articles 1-3 of the 2023 Amendment) allows the Northern Ireland Assembly to vote to suspend the application of EU goods rules if:\n\n1. A petition of concern is signed by 30+ MLAs (roughly 25% of the Assembly)\n2. The Assembly votes that EU rules are causing \"significant economic, social or political difficulties\"\n3. A simple majority votes to suspend\n\n**Legally**, this triggers a 4-month negotiation period between UK and EU. If unresolved, the UK can unilaterally suspend the rules.\n\n**Why the DUP boycotted**: They wanted the brake to be easier to trigger (lower threshold) and wanted it applied *before* problems arose, not after. They saw it as insufficient protection. The boycott was leverage to push for changes—which the UK government partially conceded through side letters and political commitments (though not formal legal changes).\n\n## The Burden of Proof Problem You've Identified\n\nThis is where the Framework gets genuinely fuzzy, and it's a legitimate student question.\n\n**The legal text** (Protocol Article 5, as amended):\n\n> Goods shall be considered as \"at risk\" of entering the Union customs territory if they do not fulfil the conditions laid down in Annex 7.\n\n**Annex 7** sets out the conditions. Goods are \"at risk\" if:\n- They don't have a \"declaration of non-movement\" (a trader's statement they won't go to the EU)\n- They don't meet origin/processing requirements\n- They're subject to EU prohibitions/restrictions\n\n**In practice, the burden sits with the trader/importer:**\n\n- Goods from third countries (China, etc.) arriving directly in NI are **presumed at risk** unless the importer can demonstrate they meet the conditions for the green lane\n- This means providing documentation showing the goods will stay in the NI/GB market\n- If you can't prove that, they go through the red lane (full checks)\n\n**The actual mechanism** (this is in the Customs Procedures Regulations and the UK's retained EU law):\n\nThe UK Border Force and the EU's Revenue and Customs Coordination Working Group determine risk profiles. But operationally, **the importer must declare the intended destination**. If there's doubt, goods are treated as \"at risk.\"\n\n## What This Means for Your \"Transit Space Port\" Question\n\nYou're not wrong, but it's more constrained than you suggest:\n\n- Goods *can* move through NI to either market, but the trader must declare intent upfront\n- There's no \"minimal scrutiny\" for goods genuinely destined for the EU—those face full checks\n- For goods staying in NI/GB, checks are lighter (hence \"green lane\")\n- The friction is real but **not symmetrical**: goods going GB→NI→EU face more scrutiny than goods staying in the GB-NI zone\n\n**The actual risk**: Traders could theoretically declare goods as \"staying in NI\" and then move them to the EU. This is why the EU insisted on post-movement monitoring and why there are penalties for false declarations.\n\n## Primary Sources for Your Student\n\n1. **Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland (Amendment) 2023** – the formal legal text (UK legislation.gov.uk)\n2. **Windsor Framework: A New Start** (27 Feb 2023) – the political summary from the UK government\n3. **EU-UK Joint Committee Decision** (2023/1/01) – the formal EU side\n4. **The Stormont Brake** – Articles 1-3 of the Amendment (very readable, 2 pages)\n\nThe student should note: the Framework is still being operationalized. The \"at risk\" determination is ongoing and contested—traders and the EU are still arguing about what counts.\n\nDoes this help clarify what you're explaining tomorrow?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 330, "completion_tokens": 1174, "total_tokens": 1504}, "latency_s": 14.738822290993994, "request_id": "chatcmpl-b41cf323-0608-4b4c-bc32-763bd6a6df85", "raw_response": null}
