The candidate answer directly contradicts this by stating, under section 1, that the contract must specify the retail price or a formula, and that the author's margin is to 'Negotiate the exact price or formula' and 'Propose a minimum price'. Furthermore, under section 2, it mentions the author's right to object if the price is 'manifestly too low' (Art. L.132-9 CPI), implying a statutory check on the publisher's pricing power, which is contrary to the strict interpretation implied by the reference answer's example: \\u201cUnder the fixed-price system, the publisher\\u2014not the author\\u2014determines the public retail price.\\u201d While French law does mandate a fixed price (or formula) in the contract, the candidate answer focuses heavily on the author's negotiation margin *on* that price, rather than confirming the publisher's ultimate authority to set the final price if negotiations fail or if the contract specifies a formula.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f4d14352-9ab6-48da-ab1a-bfbdbddda401\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1779, "completion_tokens": 309, "total_tokens": 2088}, "latency_s": 1.012195499963127, "request_id": "CiSVafTvA8jl7M8P9OOViAY", "raw_response": null}
