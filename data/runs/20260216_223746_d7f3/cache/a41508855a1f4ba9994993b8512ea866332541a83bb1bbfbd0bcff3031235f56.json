The response discusses the flexibility inherent in choosing between equity and debt financing, which is a structural choice, and it discusses the flexibility gained by interposing an Irish sister subsidiary versus direct U.S. parent financing. However, it does not explicitly recommend two distinct *forms* of structural flexibility like 'hybrid-to-debt conversion options' or 'modular entity design' as separate, actionable recommendations for ongoing flexibility beyond the initial financing choice and the choice of intermediate jurisdiction. The discussion focuses more on the comparative implications of the initial choices rather than recommending specific ongoing flexibility mechanisms.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5338ade1-d4a6-44bc-b8f6-9728ea8a5fc1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3291, "completion_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 3482}, "latency_s": 0.902799166040495, "request_id": "SuOUaYadDqGkvdIPktLvwQ4", "raw_response": null}
