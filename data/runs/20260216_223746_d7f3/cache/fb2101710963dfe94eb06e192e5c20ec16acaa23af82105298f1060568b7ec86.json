The answer also quotes the definition of the Stormont Brake, although that was not explicitly required by this specific criterion, it shows comprehensive coverage. The description of the green lane clearly relates to goods 'not intended for the EU' market, satisfying the spirit of the 'not for EU' labeling requirement in context.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ccda598d-81f1-4df2-bf89-43523370149a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3961, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 4190}, "latency_s": 1.2371837500249967, "request_id": "I_KUae_QFNHMkdUPjY-7sAQ", "raw_response": null}
