The key issue is whether the truck driver's act of allowing the chair to fall caused the injuries, despite the intervening drunk driver.\n\n## Two-Stage Causation Test\n\n### 1. **Factual Causation (\"But For\" Test)**\n\n**Application:**\n- But for the chair falling onto the roadway, would the collision have occurred?\n- Likely **YES** - the chair created the dangerous situation that prompted the swerving\n- The truck driver satisfies factual causation\n\n### 2. **Legal Causation**\n\nThis is where the analysis becomes complex due to the **intervening act** (novus actus interveniens) of the drunk driver.\n\n## Key Legal Causation Principles\n\n### **A. The \"Operating and Substantial\" Cause Test**\n\nThe truck driver's act need not be the **sole** or **main** cause, but must be:\n- More than minimal or negligible\n- An operating and substantial cause\n\n**R v Hennigan [1971]** - defendant's act need only be a substantial cause\n\n### **B. Intervening Acts - The Drunk Driver**\n\nThe critical question: Does the drunk driver's voluntary act **break the chain of causation**?\n\n#### **Relevant Principles:**\n\n**1. Foreseeability Test**\n- Was the intervening act reasonably foreseeable?\n- **R v Roberts (1971)** - victim's response must be \"daft\" or \"unexpected\" to break the chain\n- A driver swerving to avoid an obstacle is **reasonably foreseeable**\n- Even erratic swerving by an impaired driver might be foreseeable on a public roadway\n\n**2. Free, Deliberate, and Informed Acts**\n- **R v Kennedy (No 2) [2007]** - a fully voluntary, informed act by a third party may break the chain\n- However, the drunk driver's act was:\n  - **Reactive** (responding to sudden danger)\n  - **Not fully informed** (impaired judgment)\n  - **Not truly \"free\"** (emergency situation)\n- Likely **does NOT break the chain**\n\n**3. Proportionality**\n- Was the response proportionate to the threat?\n- **R v Williams & Davis [1992]** - victim's response must be \"daft\" or disproportionate\n- Swerving to avoid a chair is **proportionate**, even if executed poorly\n\n## Likely Conclusion\n\n### **Chain of Causation Probably NOT Broken**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. The truck driver created the initial dangerous situation\n2. The drunk driver's response was:\n   - Reasonably foreseeable (drivers do swerve to avoid obstacles)\n   - Not a free, deliberate, informed act (reactive and impaired)\n   - Proportionate in nature (avoiding collision), even if poorly executed\n3. The intoxication makes the response **less** voluntary, not more\n\n### **Supporting Authority:**\n- **R v Pagett (1983)** - defendant liable even when police shot killed victim during shootout\n- **R v Blaue (1975)** - \"take your victim as you find them\" - includes encountering drunk drivers on roads\n\n## Potential Defenses\n\nThe truck driver might argue:\n- The drunk driver's extreme intoxication was unforeseeable\n- The specific manner of swerving was \"daft\"\n\n**Likely to fail** because:\n- Impaired drivers on roads are a known risk\n- The **act** of swerving was reasonable; only the **execution** was poor\n- Courts are reluctant to break causation for emergency responses\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe truck driver would **likely be held to have caused** the injuries. The drunk driver's intervening act, while contributing, does not break the chain of causation because it was a foreseeable, reactive response to the danger created by the truck driver's negligence. Both parties could potentially face liability, but the original wrongdoer remains causally responsible.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 91, "completion_tokens": 943, "total_tokens": 1034}, "latency_s": 18.157024250016548, "request_id": "chatcmpl-02185f1b-9a13-4b2f-8011-6730b4b7ec1d", "raw_response": null}
