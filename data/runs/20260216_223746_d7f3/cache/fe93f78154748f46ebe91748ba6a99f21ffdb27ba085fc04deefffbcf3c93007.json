The candidate answer recommends filing a UK Binding Tariff Information (BTI) or an Origin Ruling, which is a similar mechanism for obtaining binding clarification from HMRC regarding classification or origin. While BTI/Origin Ruling serves a similar purpose to an ATR in providing certainty, the specific term 'Advance Tariff Ruling' (ATR) was not explicitly used as the primary recommendation for the Alpine model's specific issue (refrigerant classification/origin impact). The recommendation focuses on a unified origin claim supported by documentation and a BTI/Origin Ruling for the *entire* shipment, rather than specifically isolating the Alpine model for an ATR based on the R454B refrigerant.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a07478e0-ab1f-4244-81e1-6ce4bbf8d0c5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2303, "completion_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 2514}, "latency_s": 1.0912372919847257, "request_id": "ByeVabiiCIqjkdUP-qvu2QQ", "raw_response": null}
