While it does not explicitly cite the Brazilian LINDB (Decree-Law 4.657/1942) by name, the discussion of which law governs cross-border corporate acts, asset transfers (lex situs), and third-party contracts falls directly under the scope of private international law principles, which the LINDB governs in Brazil. The analysis of governing law for corporate capacity and formalities is a direct application of these principles.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e1a1d7d6-f84f-4127-b034-078fb2a8d220\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4833, "completion_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 5048}, "latency_s": 0.9904321249923669, "request_id": "NR-Vab3rOK7pnsEP2M6v6QU", "raw_response": null}
