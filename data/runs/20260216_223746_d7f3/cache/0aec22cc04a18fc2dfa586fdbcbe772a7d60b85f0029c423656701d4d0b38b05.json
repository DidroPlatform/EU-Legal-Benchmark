{"provider": "vercel_gateway", "model": "vercel_ai_gateway/openai/gpt-5.2", "text": "I can’t give legal advice, but I can tell you how priority usually works in these situations and what the real battleground issues tend to be. The key point: **a later mortgage/“further advance” can absolutely destroy the practical value of a constructive trust claim if the lender gets priority**, but **it isn’t automatically game over**—priority depends on *how the advance was made, what the lender knew or should have known, and what protections you had/should have had as someone in occupation or with a beneficial interest*.\n\nBelow is the usual framework (England & Wales). If you’re elsewhere, say where and I’ll adapt.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Can the lender’s charge “wipe you out” even if you win constructive trust?\n**Often, yes in practice.** Even if you establish you have a beneficial interest (constructive trust / proprietary estoppel), **a registered legal charge typically has priority over later or unprotected equitable interests**. If the bank’s charge ranks ahead of your interest, then on sale the bank is paid first. If that consumes the equity, you can “win” and still receive nothing.\n\nBut whether the bank ranks ahead is **not a given**.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Why might the lender have priority?\nPriority commonly turns on these points:\n\n### A) Was this a “further advance” under an existing mortgage, or a brand-new remortgage?\n- **Brand-new remortgage** (new lender, new legal charge): the lender typically insists on vacant possession/consents/solicitor checks. If you were living there, this can raise issues (see “overriding interests” below).\n- **Further advance with the same lender**: the original charge is already on the title. Many mortgage terms allow further borrowing. Priority is governed by a mixture of:\n  - the mortgage terms\n  - **Land Registration Act 2002**\n  - **whether the lender had notice of another interest**\n  - whether the advance was “obligatory” or “optional” (this matters a lot)\n\n### B) “Obligatory” vs “optional” further advances (crucial)\nIf the mortgage contract **obliged** the lender to make further advances (rare in consumer lending, but possible in some facilities), then the further advance may keep the same priority as the original charge.\n\nIf it was **optional** (much more common), then **a further advance can lose priority** *if* at the time of making it the lender had notice of another interest (or sometimes a restriction/notice on the register indicating it).\n\nIn plain English: **if the lender didn’t have to lend the extra €200k and should have known someone else had a stake, you may have leverage to argue the extra lending shouldn’t outrank you.**\n\n---\n\n## 3) Your strongest line of attack is often: “I had a beneficial interest + I was in actual occupation”\nIf you had a beneficial interest (from contributions, renovation funding, common intention etc.) and you were **in actual occupation**, your interest may be an **overriding interest** binding a purchaser (and sometimes a mortgagee), even if it isn’t registered.\n\nThis is not automatic, and lenders often protect themselves by:\n- requiring all occupiers to sign **consent/postponement forms** (sometimes called “occupier’s consent”)\n- ensuring occupiers are identified and either become party to the mortgage or postpone their rights\n\nSo the questions that matter immediately are:\n- Were you **living there** at the time of the remortgage/further advance?\n- Did you sign **anything** (consent, waiver, declaration of no interest, ID check forms, “occupier consent”)?\n- Did the lender/solicitors ever contact you or ask you to sign?\n- Were you temporarily absent (work, hospital, staying elsewhere) when the lender inspected? (Temporary absence doesn’t necessarily defeat “actual occupation,” but it becomes fact-sensitive.)\n\nIf you were in occupation and never consented, **that is often the factual hook to challenge priority**—or at least to force the lender to take the risk seriously.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Can you argue: “The loan was secret and after my investment, so it shouldn’t beat me”?\n“Secret” by itself isn’t usually enough. What matters is **notice / occupation / register protections**.\n\nHowever, you *may* have viable arguments depending on facts:\n\n### A) Lack of consent / occupier waiver\nIf you were an occupier and didn’t sign a postponement, the lender may face an argument that your interest binds them (or at minimum that the further advance shouldn’t gain priority over you).\n\n### B) Optional further advance + notice\nIf it’s the same lender and this was optional, the lender’s priority for the extra €200k can be attacked if the lender had **notice** of your interest (which can be inferred if you were in occupation and they didn’t properly investigate).\n\n### C) Broker/solicitor/lender negligence issues\nIf a lender’s conveyancer failed to do standard occupancy checks, or accepted dubious statements from your ex, the lender may still enforce against the property—but there can be **negligence / breach of duty** routes that create settlement pressure or a compensation claim (this gets technical quickly).\n\n### D) Fraud / undue influence / misrepresentation (limited but sometimes powerful)\nIf your ex forged signatures or lied about occupiers, lenders will usually try to enforce their charge anyway, but fraud can change who bears the loss and can open different remedies.\n\n---\n\n## 5) What your ex’s solicitor is saying: “Even if you win, the lender eats the equity”\nThat statement is **sometimes true on the numbers**, but it’s also a **standard pressure tactic** because it assumes:\n1) the lender’s further advance definitely has priority; and\n2) there’s no viable claim that changes that; and\n3) you can’t get any personal remedy against your ex (damages/account) even if the property equity is gone.\n\nThose assumptions may be wrong.\n\nEven if the bank does get paid first, you may still have:\n- a **personal claim against your ex** for your share/value (constructive trust accounting, equitable compensation, deceit, etc.)\n- a claim that the ex has **dissipated** relationship/property assets (depending on your jurisdiction and relationship status)\n- procedural leverage: an **injunction / restriction** preventing sale/refinance without notice to you while the dispute is resolved\n\nSo: the lender priority issue is huge, but not the only route.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Immediate steps (practical, high impact)\n1) **Get the title register + mortgage documents** (official copies):  \n   - confirm whether it’s a new charge or further advance  \n   - dates, lenders, amount secured, any restrictions/notes\n\n2) **Subject access request (SAR) to the lender** (and the conveyancer if possible):  \n   Ask for: application, occupancy declarations, valuation notes, call logs, broker notes, ID/AML, signed consents, any “who lives at the property” forms.\n\n3) **Lock down the register**:  \n   If you haven’t already, ask a solicitor about entering a **restriction / notice** (depending on what you can evidence). This can prevent a clean sale or further borrowing without dealing with you.\n\n4) **Evidence your occupation and contributions**:  \n   - council tax, utility bills, electoral roll, insurance, bank transfers, receipts for renovations, messages acknowledging your investment, photographs, contractor invoices\n\n5) **Do not sign a “walk away” settlement under pressure** until you’ve had advice from a property litigation solicitor who does trusts + land registration priority disputes.\n\n---\n\n## 7) What I need to answer more concretely\nIf you tell me the following, I can map the likely priority position more precisely (still not legal advice, but much more targeted):\n\n1) Country/jurisdiction (England & Wales, Ireland, etc.)  \n2) Are you on the legal title? If not, were you living there at the time of the remortgage/further advance?  \n3) Same lender as before, or a new lender?  \n4) Did you ever sign an occupier consent / waiver / mortgage documents?  \n5) Was the property ever rented out / were you absent at the time?  \n6) Rough current value, existing mortgage balance before the extra €200k, and current total secured debt.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n- **Yes**, a lender’s charge **can** practically wipe out your recovery **if** it has priority and the numbers leave no equity.  \n- **No**, it’s **not automatically true** that the lender must have priority for a *secret* later advance—priority can be challenged depending on **occupation, notice, optional vs obligatory advance, and whether you signed any postponement/consent**.  \n- You may still have **personal remedies against your ex** even if property equity is eaten up.\n\nAnswer the six questions above and I’ll outline the most likely priority scenario and which facts are make-or-break.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 207, "completion_tokens": 1889, "total_tokens": 2096}, "latency_s": 45.077855667012045, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJ1AWE312RBTWMR7NBF8SY", "raw_response": null}
