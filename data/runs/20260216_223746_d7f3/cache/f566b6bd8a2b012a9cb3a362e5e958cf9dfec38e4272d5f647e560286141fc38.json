They are informational activities, not binding legal acts. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**Statement ii**: The Digest (Pandects) was NOT a short introduction for students. It was a massive compilation of Roman legal writings. The short introduction for students was the \"Institutes.\" This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**Statement iii**: In Swiss civil proceedings, parties cannot always make new factual submissions and introduce new evidence without restriction in the main oral hearing. There are rules about when new facts and evidence can be introduced, particularly regarding timeliness and relevance. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**Statement iv**: Swiss commercial law does permit the registration of limited liability partnerships (Kollektivgesellschaft and other partnership forms exist). This statement appears **correct**.\n\n**Statement v**: According to Luhmann's theory of autopoietic social systems, systems are operationally closed and self-referential. The legal system doesn't \"trigger democratic impulses\" in politics in this direct way - each system operates according to its own code. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\nIncorrect statements: i, ii, iii, and v\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n{\"answer\": \"B\", \"reasoning\": \"Statements i, ii, iii, and v are incorrect: (i) information campaigns aren't appealable administrative decisions; (ii) the Digest was a massive compilation, not a short student introduction (that was the Institutes); (iii) Swiss civil procedure has restrictions on new submissions; (v) autopoietic theory doesn't support legal systems triggering democratic impulses in politics due to operational closure of systems.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 288, "completion_tokens": 389, "total_tokens": 677}, "latency_s": 7.408215458999621, "request_id": "chatcmpl-aa4e0e62-cdd1-41a1-9a0c-2f5404c4aa81", "raw_response": null}
