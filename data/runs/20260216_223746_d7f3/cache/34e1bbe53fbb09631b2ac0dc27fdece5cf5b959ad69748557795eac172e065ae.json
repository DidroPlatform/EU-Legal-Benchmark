{"provider": "nim", "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", "text": " Under French publishing law, **your legal margin to impose or even negotiate the selling price is extremely limited**, but there are contractual workarounds. Here is the breakdown:\n\n## 1. The Legal Default: The Publisher Decides\nArticle **L. 132-17 of the Intellectual Property Code** states that the publisher (éditeur) has the exclusive right to determine the **selling price** (prix de vente au public), the format, and the presentation of the work. This is considered part of the publisher's \"right of exploitation\" (droit de destination).\n\n**For digital books specifically:** While the \"Lang Law\" (fixed book price) technically applies to e-books, it functions differently than for print. The publisher sets the price, and discounts are regulated but more flexible than for physical books.\n\n## 2. What You Can Actually Negotiate\nSince you cannot legally *impose* the price, you negotiate **contractual limitations** on the publisher's pricing power:\n\n- **Consultation clause**: Require the publisher to inform you of the intended price range before publication and consult you before any significant price changes (though they retain final decision).\n- **Floor price protection**: Negotiate a clause prohibiting sale below a certain threshold (e.g., \"no sales below €X without written consent\"). This is rare but possible, especially for niche academic/educational works.\n- **Promotional limits**: Limit the frequency or depth of promotional pricing (e.g., \"maximum 30% discount for 2 weeks per year\").\n- **Royalty structure**: Since you can't control the price, negotiate higher royalties (typically 25-40% for digital vs. 7-10% for print) or royalties calculated on the *gross* price (prix catalogue) rather than net receipts, protecting you from deep discounts.\n\n## 3. Critical Warning: Your Content is Legally Risky\nYou describe your work as **\"annotated extracts of newspaper articles.\"** This raises major **copyright red flags** that could torpedo your contract:\n\n- **Newspaper articles are protected** by copyright in France (L. 112-1 CPI).\n- **\"Extracts\"** may infringe if they exceed \"short quotations\" (courtes citations) or critical analysis limits under L. 122-5 CPI.\n- **Annotation** does not automatically transform copyrighted material into a new original work that bypasses the need for permissions.\n\n**Action required:** Before signing, you must either:\n- Confirm all extracts fall under the \"short quotation\" exception (very short excerpts, justified by the critical/analytical purpose, clearly attributed), OR\n- Obtain authorization from the newspaper publishers (which usually requires payment), OR\n- Ensure your publisher has secured the clearances.\n\nIf the publisher discovers rights issues after publication, **you** (not the publisher) are typically liable for copyright infringement and indemnification.\n\n## 4. Negotiation Strategy for an Online Publisher\nSince they publish exclusively online:\n- **Pricing transparency**: Ask for a clause requiring them to maintain the book at a \"standard\" price (not permanently discounted) for the first 6-12 months to protect your royalty value.\n- ** Territory**: Clarify if \"online\" means France only, French-speaking territories, or worldwide (affects pricing strategy).\n- **Subscription models**: If they use subscription access (e.g., \"all-you-can-read\"), negotiate a minimum guaranteed payment per download/view or a higher flat fee, as unit pricing disappears.\n\n**Summary:** You cannot legally force a specific price, but you can contractually constrain the publisher's discounting freedom and protect your revenue through royalty structure. **Prioritize resolving the copyright clearance on those newspaper extracts before discussing price—it is the dealbreaker.**\n\nWould you like specific contract clause wording for any of these protections?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 75, "completion_tokens": 1931, "total_tokens": 2006}, "latency_s": 101.69832683401182, "request_id": "chatcmpl-95d409024d748ad6", "raw_response": null}
