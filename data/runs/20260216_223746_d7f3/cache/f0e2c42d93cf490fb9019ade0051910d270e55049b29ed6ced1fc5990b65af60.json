The **convention constitutive** (founding agreement) of the GIP determines the applicable personnel regime. Two scenarios exist:\n\n1. **Public law regime** – staff are public agents (contractual agents under public law)\n2. **Private law regime** – staff are employed under the **Code du travail**\n\nThe convention constitutive can opt for:\n- An exclusively public law regime\n- An exclusively private law regime\n- A **mixed regime** combining both\n\n### Contributing to Public Service Is Not an Obstacle\n\nThe fact that the agent contributes to **public service activities (missions de service public)** does **not**, in itself, prevent employment under private law. This is a well-established specificity of GIPs. Unlike EPA (établissements publics administratifs), where the principle from **CE, Berkani, 1996** presumes public law status for personnel, GIPs are **not** classified as établissements publics and are therefore not subject to this jurisprudential rule.\n\nThe **Tribunal des conflits** and the **Conseil d'État** have confirmed that the nature of the employment relationship in a GIP depends on what the convention constitutive provides, not on the nature of the missions performed.\n\n## Conditions and Precautions\n\n### 1. Check Your Convention Constitutive\nThis is **essential**. You must verify that your GIP's founding agreement:\n- Expressly authorizes recruitment under private law, or\n- Provides for a mixed regime, or\n- Does not restrict recruitment exclusively to public law\n\nIf the convention constitutive provides exclusively for a public law regime, you **cannot** recruit under private law without first amending it.\n\n### 2. Applicable Rules Under Private Law\nIf private law recruitment is authorized:\n- The **Code du travail** applies (CDD, CDI, etc.)\n- The agent is subject to **private law jurisdiction** (Conseil de prud'hommes) for employment disputes\n- Social security is under the **régime général** (not the public agent regime)\n- Collective agreements may apply depending on the GIP's activity\n\n### 3. Specific Situations to Watch\n\n- **Fonctionnaires détachés or mis à disposition**: civil servants seconded to the GIP retain their public law status regardless of the GIP's personnel regime\n- **Mixed regime**: if your GIP employs both public and private law agents, ensure clear distinction in contracts and applicable rules\n- **Reclassification risk**: ensure that the contract and working conditions are genuinely consistent with private law to avoid judicial reclassification\n\n## Relevant Case Law\n\n- **TC, 14 February 2000, GIP Habitat et Interventions Sociales**: confirmed that personnel regime depends on the convention constitutive\n- **CE, 2013-2014 decisions**: reinforced the autonomy of GIPs in choosing their personnel regime\n- The Conseil d'État has consistently held that GIPs are **sui generis** public law entities, distinct from établissements publics\n\n## Practical Recommendation\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| **1** | Review your convention constitutive carefully |\n| **2** | If private law is authorized, draft a compliant employment contract under the Code du travail |\n| **3** | Ensure proper social security affiliation (régime général) |\n| **4** | Identify the competent jurisdiction (prud'hommes) in the contract |\n| **5** | If the convention is silent or restrictive, consider an amendment approved by the general assembly |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe participation in public service missions **does not determine** the legal regime of employment in a GIP. What matters is the **convention constitutive**. This flexibility is precisely one of the distinctive advantages of the GIP structure compared to traditional public establishments. Provided your founding agreement permits it, you may lawfully recruit agents under private law, even for public service activities.\n\n> **Caveat**: Given the complexity and the stakes (particularly regarding jurisdictional competence and social protection), I would recommend confirming this analysis with your GIP's legal counsel or the supervising authority, especially if the convention constitutive is ambiguous.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 57, "completion_tokens": 1115, "total_tokens": 1172}, "latency_s": 27.93716020800639, "request_id": "chatcmpl-dc591378-05e1-412f-8315-ef29b495fcee", "raw_response": null}
