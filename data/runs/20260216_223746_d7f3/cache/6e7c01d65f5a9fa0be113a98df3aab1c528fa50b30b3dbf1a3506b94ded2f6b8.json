The candidate answer explicitly addresses this tension in Section 2 and Section 4. Specifically, Section 4 discusses structuring the order to account for potential conflict, such as stating: \\\"If the tribunal issues such an order, the court\\u2019s order shall be stayed to the extent of any inconsistency.\\\" Furthermore, Section 6 discusses the likely outcome when the tribunal issues a preservation order, implying the risk of conflicting or overlapping orders. The entire structure of the balancing test (Section 3) is designed to manage this conflict by deferring to the tribunal if it can act, thus mitigating the risk of parallel, conflicting proceedings.\", \"criterion_id\": \"36e47807-e2dd-46b6-912f-ace82d771cd9\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3901, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 4117}, "latency_s": 0.9115870000096038, "request_id": "6eqUabuxPN_x7M8P3PK2gQE", "raw_response": null}
