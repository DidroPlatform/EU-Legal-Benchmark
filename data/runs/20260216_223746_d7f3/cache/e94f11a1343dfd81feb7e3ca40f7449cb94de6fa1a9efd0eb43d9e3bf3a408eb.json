The candidate answer explicitly addresses the unworkability of the original Protocol by detailing the problems that led to the Windsor Framework:\\n\\n1. **Heavy customs infrastructure/Bureaucracy:** The answer notes that the original Protocol treated essentially all GB-to-NI goods movements as requiring 'full customs declarations and SPS checks,' which caused 'enormous friction' and 'immense bureaucratic burdens' (implied by the contrast with the Green Lane).\\n2. **Unworkable 'at risk' mechanisms:** The answer states that under the original Protocol, goods were 'presumed at risk unless the trader could demonstrate otherwise,' which was the regime that caused friction.\\n3. **Political turmoil:** The answer directly links the Protocol to the DUP boycott, citing their objection to the 'Irish Sea border' and the constitutional implications, which caused the collapse of the Executive.\\n\\nThe answer clearly identifies these factors as the reason the original Protocol required replacement, satisfying the requirement to discuss the unworkability by referencing multiple factors.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2826ef22-06a3-46de-8eb3-18cf74e9e1ed\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4204, "completion_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 4507}, "latency_s": 1.2730602090014145, "request_id": "4MSUaeWODsf5nsEPi7DUqAI", "raw_response": null}
