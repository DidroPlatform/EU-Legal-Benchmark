The candidate answer mentions fines in Section 7, under the heading 'Risk': \\\"If the CNIL discovers that health data were processed without a valid legal basis, it can impose a fine (up to \\u20ac20 million or 4 % of global turnover) and order you to delete the data.\\\" However, the response is structured as a comprehensive guide, and the mention of fines is buried deep within a section about remediation, not as a direct answer to the initial question or as a primary consequence listed early on. Given the strict nature of the evaluation, and that the primary focus of the response is on obligations rather than penalties, I will mark this as not clearly satisfied as a direct statement of consequence.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8d8023af-af12-48a2-b432-066ae915a51a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4422, "completion_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 4637}, "latency_s": 1.2371964170015417, "request_id": "KOaUaZCnD6H0xN8P39CegA8", "raw_response": null}
