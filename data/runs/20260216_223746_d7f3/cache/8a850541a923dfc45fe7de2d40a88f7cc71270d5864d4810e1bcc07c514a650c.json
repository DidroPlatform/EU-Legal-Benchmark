The candidate answer correctly notes that private law staff can be employed even for public service activities, provided certain conditions (like lack of PPP exercise) are met. However, it fails to directly address the specific default rule mentioned in the criterion: that if the GIP's main object is an SPA, public law is the default regime. The candidate answer focuses on the possibility of using private law rather than confirming or refuting the default public law status implied by the criterion when the GIP performs an SPA.\", \"criterion_id\": \"18abdf2a-eb07-4ab6-872f-df2b404b1dcb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1139, "completion_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 1323}, "latency_s": 0.9463890829938464, "request_id": "CBSVaenCLMzXvdIPq7fiiAU", "raw_response": null}
