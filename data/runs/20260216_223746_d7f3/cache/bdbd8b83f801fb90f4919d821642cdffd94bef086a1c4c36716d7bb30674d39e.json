The candidate answer focuses almost entirely on defending the *enforcement* of an award already rendered in a foreign seat (Paris) under the New York Convention, primarily addressing defenses under Article V. It discusses the impropriety of the *anti-arbitration injunction* itself (citing federal cases like Paramedics) but does not address the specific circumstances under which *New York state courts* would issue such an injunction in the first place, which is what the criterion asks about. The response discusses federal policy favoring arbitration but fails to address the specific state court standard for granting anti-arbitration injunctions as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f24c358a-43a3-47ef-b32c-ce86625942a9\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4003, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 4219}, "latency_s": 1.2340758749924134, "request_id": "ur2Uaff_N9D-nsEPgIiFuAU", "raw_response": null}
