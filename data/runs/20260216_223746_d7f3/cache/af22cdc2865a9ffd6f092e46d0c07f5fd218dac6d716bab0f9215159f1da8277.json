The candidate answer states, \\\"You can negotiate: ... The retail price itself,\\\" which implies the author has a role in setting the price, but it does not explicitly state that the author *sets, fixes, or legally approves* the final retail price as a legal right under French law. In fact, French law (Loi Lang, 1981) generally fixes the retail price for books (though exceptions exist, especially for online/digital sales, which this case involves), and the publisher usually determines the final price, subject to negotiation. The response focuses on negotiation freedom rather than the legal mechanism of price setting/approval by the author.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a4b9ac1f-ad65-4795-8621-04e72c36c1f3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 682, "completion_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 890}, "latency_s": 1.547076165996259, "request_id": "bsiUacPcDsGknsEPzKbYmAI", "raw_response": null}
