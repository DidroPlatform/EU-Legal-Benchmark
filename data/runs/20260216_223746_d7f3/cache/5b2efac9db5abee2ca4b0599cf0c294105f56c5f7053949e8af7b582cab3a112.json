The candidate answer explicitly states, 'Yes, you should have informed your members that you were collecting this information. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies in France, you are required to inform individuals about the collection and processing of their personal data.' While it focuses on 'informing' (transparency/Article 13/14), it also mentions the legal basis, which often includes consent or legitimate interest (Article 6). Given the context of collecting sensitive-adjacent data (ability to practice sports) for planning, informing them and obtaining consent (or establishing a clear legal basis) is the core requirement.
