The candidate answer discusses Option B: Fiscal Representative + Indirect Representation, but it incorrectly describes the roles. It states the Customs Broker acts as the Indirect Representative, but then implies the Fiscal Representative handles VAT liability. Crucially, it fails to mention the concept of 'joint and several liability' for the customs debt specifically associated with an indirect representation agreement, which is the core requirement of the criterion. The structure described is confusing and does not explicitly address the required legal liability mechanism for an indirect representative.\", \"criterion_id\": \"566fd9ff-4870-40ea-bad8-2cfc7888257d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4357, "completion_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 4531}, "latency_s": 1.118721499980893, "request_id": "SsuUafjhNNyWkdUPpoLOyQM", "raw_response": null}
