The ad also fails to give you the **right to be identified** (s 77) and may be a *derogatory treatment* if the image is altered in a way that harms your reputation (s 80).' Furthermore, in Section 4.2, it details the remedies for the Moral Right breach, specifically mentioning the 'Right to be identified (s 77) \\u2013 the ad gave no credit to you.' This directly addresses the requirement by linking the moral right breach (failure to attribute) to the commercial act of advertising/exhibiting in public.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c7044567-39eb-4f9b-b0f9-1e689184f731\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4280, "completion_tokens": 283, "total_tokens": 4563}, "latency_s": 1.187122083036229, "request_id": "E-2UabqgLtGxnsEPuvytyAM", "raw_response": null}
