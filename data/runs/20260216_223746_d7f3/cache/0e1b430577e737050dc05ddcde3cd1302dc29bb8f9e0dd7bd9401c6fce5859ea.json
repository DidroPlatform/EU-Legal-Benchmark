It follows the typical structure: (1) noting the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded under Article 35 § 3(a), (2) confirming no other inadmissibility grounds apply, and (3) declaring it admissible. This is the proper continuation when the Court finds a complaint warrants substantive examination. Options A and D reject complaints as inadmissible, while C addresses situations where one violation makes separate examination of other articles unnecessary - none of which fit a standard admissibility declaration as well as B.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 445, "completion_tokens": 156, "total_tokens": 601}, "latency_s": 3.986975625011837, "request_id": "chatcmpl-9c66d511-1efe-4757-ae82-c98fbe5abdac", "raw_response": null}
