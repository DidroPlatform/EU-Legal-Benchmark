Let me break this down comprehensively.\n\n---\n\n## PART 1: DEFENDING COPYRIGHT IN ITALY\n\n### Applicable Legal Framework\n\nYour client's copyright is protected in Italy through several overlapping legal instruments:\n\n**The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works** is the foundational treaty here. Both the US and Italy are signatories. Under the Berne Convention's principle of **national treatment** (Article 5), your client's work is entitled to the same protection in Italy that Italian authors receive under Italian law. Critically, the Berne Convention requires **no formalities** — your client does not need to have registered the copyright in Italy, filed any paperwork, or even placed a copyright notice on the work. Protection is automatic upon creation.\n\n**Italian Copyright Law (Legge 22 aprile 1941, n. 633 — \"Legge sul Diritto d'Autore\")** as amended, governs the substantive rights. Under this law, original works of a creative character, including drawings, illustrations, and characters, are protected. Article 1 protects works of the mind having a creative character, and Article 2 specifically includes works of drawing and figurative arts.\n\n**EU Directives**, particularly the **InfoSoc Directive (2001/29/EC)** and the **Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EC)**, harmonize certain aspects of copyright protection and enforcement across EU member states, including Italy.\n\n### Are the T-Shirts Infringing?\n\nLet me analyze each shirt separately under Italian law:\n\n**Shirt 1 — The character in a different outfit with crazy sunglasses:** This is almost certainly infringing. Under Italian copyright law, a cartoon character can be protected as a distinct artistic work when it has sufficiently distinctive features. Changing the outfit and adding sunglasses does not create a new, independent work — it is a **modification (elaborazione)** of the original under Article 4 of the Italian Copyright Law. The character remains recognizably your client's creation. The right to make adaptations and modifications belongs exclusively to the author under Article 18. The fact that the vendors are clearly trading on the recognizability of the character demonstrates that the essential creative elements have been reproduced.\n\n**Shirt 2 — The character dressed as a workers' rights advocate tied to an Italian movement:** This is also very likely infringing, though it introduces a slightly more nuanced question. The character is being used in a political or social commentary context. However, Italian copyright law's exceptions are **narrower** than US fair use. Italy does not have a general fair use doctrine. Instead, it has a closed list of exceptions under Articles 65-71 of the Copyright Law. The relevant exceptions include:\n\n- Article 65: reproduction of articles on current economic, political, or religious topics (not applicable here — this is merchandise, not journalism)\n- Article 70: quotation for purposes of criticism, discussion, or teaching, provided it is done for non-commercial purposes and does not compete with the economic exploitation of the work\n\nThe key problem for anyone claiming an exception here is that **these are commercial products being sold on carts**. The commercial nature of the use makes it extremely difficult to invoke any Italian copyright exception. Even if there is a political message, the medium is merchandise sold for profit, not commentary or criticism in an editorial context.\n\nAdditionally, your client may have **moral rights (diritti morali)** claims under Articles 20-24 of the Italian Copyright Law. Moral rights in Italy are **perpetual, inalienable, and non-waivable** — far stronger than in the US. Article 20 gives the author the right to object to any distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work that would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation. Associating the character with a specific political movement without the author's consent could constitute such a prejudicial modification, particularly if the political association is controversial or could alienate portions of the audience.\n\n**Shirt 3 — A warped version mocking a famous joke from the show:** This is also likely infringing, and it raises both reproduction/adaptation rights and moral rights issues. The \"warping\" of the character is a modification under Article 4/18, and the mocking nature could trigger moral rights protection under Article 20. Italian courts have historically been protective of authors' moral rights. Parody does exist as a concept in EU law — the **CJEU in Deckmyn v. Vandersteen (C-201/13)** recognized parody as an autonomous EU concept — but the parody must strike a **fair balance** between the rights of the copyright holder and the freedom of expression of the parodist. A commercial t-shirt that warps the character primarily to sell merchandise (rather than to make a genuine parodic commentary) would likely not qualify.\n\n### Enforcement Options in Italy\n\n**1. Cease and Desist Letters (Diffida)**\nThe first step would typically be to send formal cease and desist letters (diffide) to the vendors through an Italian attorney (avvocato). This puts them on notice and can sometimes resolve the matter without litigation.\n\n**2. Civil Action (Azione Civile)**\nYour client can file a civil lawsuit in Italian courts. Under the Enforcement Directive (implemented in Italy through Legislative Decree 140/2006), the remedies available include:\n\n- **Injunctive relief (inibitoria)** — ordering the vendors to stop selling the infringing merchandise\n- **Seizure and destruction** of infringing goods (sequestro e distruzione)\n- **Damages (risarcimento del danno)** — which can be calculated based on lost profits, the infringer's profits, or a reasonable royalty\n- **Publication of the judgment** — the court can order that the decision be published in newspapers or other media at the infringer's expense, which serves both a reputational and deterrent function\n\n**3. Provisional/Emergency Measures (Procedimento Cautelare)**\nItalian courts can grant **urgent provisional measures** under Articles 156-162 of the Copyright Law and the general provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. This is particularly useful because:\n\n- You can obtain an **ex parte seizure order (descrizione e sequestro)** — meaning the court can order seizure of the infringing goods without prior notice to the infringers, preventing them from hiding or destroying inventory\n- These measures can be obtained relatively quickly\n- The specialized IP sections (Sezioni Specializzate in materia di Impresa) of Italian courts handle these matters\n\n**4. Criminal Enforcement**\nItalian copyright law has **criminal provisions** (Articles 171-174), which is a significant enforcement tool. Unauthorized reproduction and sale of copyrighted works for commercial purposes can constitute a criminal offense punishable by fines and imprisonment. Your client could file a criminal complaint (querela or denuncia) with the Italian authorities. The **Guardia di Finanza** (financial police) actively enforces IP rights and can conduct raids and seizures. Criminal enforcement can be particularly effective against street vendors and market stalls.\n\n**5. Customs Enforcement**\nUnder EU Regulation 608/2013, your client can file an application with Italian customs authorities to detain goods suspected of infringing IP rights. This can help prevent further importation or distribution of the infringing shirts.\n\n### Practical Considerations\n\n- Your client should **document everything** — photographs of the carts, the shirts, the locations, receipts if possible, and any identifying information about the vendors.\n- You will need to engage **Italian counsel** — an avvocato with IP expertise, ideally in Rome given the location.\n- Consider whether the vendors are part of a **larger operation** — often street vendors are supplied by larger manufacturers or distributors, and targeting the source is more effective than targeting individual sellers.\n- **Evidence preservation** is critical — consider having a notarial act (atto notarile) prepared by an Italian notary who can officially document the infringement, which carries strong evidentiary weight in Italian proceedings.\n\n---\n\n## PART 2: ANALYSIS UNDER US LAW\n\nIf the same shirts were found being sold in the United States, the analysis would proceed under the **Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq.)**.\n\n### Copyrightability of the Character\n\nUnder US law, cartoon characters can be protected by copyright when they are **sufficiently distinctive and well-delineated**. The standard comes from cases like **Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates (9th Cir. 1978)** and the more recent **DC Comics v. Towle (9th Cir. 2015)**, which established a three-part test for character copyrightability: the character must have (1) physical as well as conceptual qualities, (2) be sufficiently delineated to be recognizable as the same character whenever it appears, and (3) be especially distinctive and contain some unique elements of expression.\n\nA successful cartoon character with 1 million YouTube subscribers almost certainly meets this standard. The visual design — the specific combination of shapes, colors, proportions, and features — constitutes protectable expression.\n\nYour client should ideally have a **copyright registration** with the US Copyright Office. While copyright exists automatically upon creation (as under the Berne Convention), registration is a **prerequisite to filing suit** for works of US origin under **17 U.S.C. § 411(a)**. Additionally, timely registration (before infringement or within three months of publication) enables recovery of **statutory damages and attorney's fees** under **17 U.S.C. § 412**, which dramatically changes the litigation calculus.\n\n### Infringement Analysis\n\nTo establish infringement, your client must show (1) ownership of a valid copyright and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original. The analysis for each shirt:\n\n**Shirt 1 — Different outfit, crazy sunglasses:** This is a **derivative work** under 17 U.S.C. § 106(2). The exclusive right to prepare derivative works belongs to the copyright holder. A derivative work is one \"based upon one or more preexisting works\" that \"recast[s], transform[s], or adapt[s]\" the original. Changing the outfit while retaining the recognizable character is a textbook derivative work. Under **substantial similarity** analysis (whether using the **ordinary observer test** from *Arnstein v. Porter* or the **extrinsic/intrinsic test** from *Sid & Marty Krofft v. McDonald's*), the character would be substantially similar to the original because the core visual elements are preserved. This would be straightforward infringement.\n\n**Shirt 2 — Workers' rights advocate outfit tied to a political movement:** The infringement analysis is the same as Shirt 1 — it's an unauthorized derivative work. However, the political dimension raises the question of **fair use** under **17 U.S.C. § 107**, which is where US law diverges significantly from Italian law.\n\nThe four fair use factors are:\n\n**(1) Purpose and character of the use:** This factor examines whether the use is **transformative** — does it add new expression, meaning, or message? After **Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith (2023)**, the Supreme Court significantly narrowed the transformative use analysis, holding that when the use has the **same or highly similar purpose** as the original (here, both are commercial merchandise featuring the character's likeness), the first factor weighs against fair use even if the new work adds some new meaning. Putting the character in a political outfit on a t-shirt sold commercially has the same essential purpose as authorized merchandise — trading on the character's appeal. This factor likely weighs **against** fair use.\n\n**(2) Nature of the copyrighted work:** Creative, fictional works receive **stronger protection** than factual works. A cartoon character is highly creative. This factor weighs **against** fair use.\n\n**(3) Amount and substantiality of the portion used:** The entire character is being reproduced (even if modified). When the \"heart\" of the work is taken, this factor weighs against fair use. See **Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises (1985)**.\n\n**(4) Effect on the market:** Unauthorized merchandise directly competes with and substitutes for authorized merchandise. This factor weighs **strongly against** fair use. The existence of a licensing market for character merchandise is well-established, and the infringing shirts usurp that market.\n\nOverall, a fair use defense for this shirt would very likely **fail** under US law, despite the political message, primarily because it is commercial merchandise.\n\n**Shirt 3 — Warped parody version mocking a joke:** This is the most interesting US law analysis because **parody receives significant fair use protection** under US law, far more than in Italy.\n\nThe landmark case is **Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. (1994)**, where the Supreme Court held that parody — which by definition must borrow from the original to make its point — can qualify as fair use. However, the analysis is still case-specific:\n\n**(1) Purpose and character:** A parody that comments on or criticizes the original work is more likely to be transformative. If the warped version is genuinely mocking the show's joke — commenting on the original — it has a stronger claim to being transformative than if it merely uses the character for humor unrelated to the original. However, post-**Warhol**, the commercial nature of the use (selling t-shirts) cuts against this factor. The court would ask whether the new use has a substantially different purpose from the original, or whether it merely serves as a substitute in the same market (merchandise).\n\n**(2) Nature of the work:** Still weighs against fair use (creative work).\n\n**(3) Amount used:** Parody is given more latitude here because it must conjure up the original. Taking the recognizable character is arguably necessary for the parody to work. However, taking more than necessary to conjure up the original weighs against fair use.\n\n**(4) Market effect:** This is critical. If the warped parody shirt serves as a **market substitute** for authorized merchandise, this weighs against fair use. The question is whether consumers would buy the parody shirt *instead of* an authorized shirt. Given that both are t-shirts featuring the character, there is a strong argument that they compete in the same market.\n\nThe parody defense is **stronger** for this shirt than for the others, but it is far from certain to succeed, especially in the post-*Warhol* landscape where commercial exploitation weighs heavily. The **Air Pirates** case is also instructive — the Ninth Circuit found that underground comics parodying Disney characters were infringing despite their parodic nature, in part because they copied the characters' visual appearance extensively.\n\n### US Enforcement Options\n\n- **Federal court litigation** under the Copyright Act (subject to registration requirement)\n- **Statutory damages** of $750–$30,000 per work infringed (up to $150,000 for willful infringement) under § 504(c), if registration was timely\n- **Injunctive relief** under § 502\n- **Impoundment and destruction** of infringing articles under §§ 503, 509\n- **Attorney's fees** under § 505 (discretionary, but more available with timely registration)\n- **DMCA takedown notices** if the shirts are being sold or advertised online\n- **Customs recordation** with US Customs and Border Protection to prevent importation of infringing goods\n\n### Additional US Claims\n\nBeyond copyright, your client might also have:\n\n- **Trademark claims** under the **Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1125(a))** if the character or show name functions as a source identifier — likelihood of confusion, dilution\n- **State law claims** including unfair competition, unjust enrichment, and potentially right of publicity depending on the jurisdiction\n- **DMCA § 1202 claims** if copyright management information was removed or altered\n\n---\n\n## KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ITALY AND THE US\n\n| Issue | Italy | United States |\n|-------|-------|---------------|\n| **Registration required?** | No | No for protection, but yes to file suit (US works) |\n| **Fair use/exceptions** | Narrow, closed list of exceptions; no general fair use | Broad, flexible four-factor fair use defense |\n| **Parody protection** | Limited; must balance with author's rights | Stronger; Campbell v. Acuff-Rose provides significant protection |\n| **Moral rights** | Strong, perpetual, inalienable (Art. 20-24) | Very limited — only for works of visual art under VARA (17 U.S.C. § 106A), which likely wouldn't cover a cartoon character on YouTube |\n| **Criminal enforcement** | Available and actively used | Available under 17 U.S.C. § 506 but less commonly pursued for merchandise |\n| **Damages** | Actual damages; no statutory damages regime like the US | Statutory damages available (potentially very significant) |\n\n---\n\n## RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. **Immediately document** all evidence of the infringing shirts in Rome\n2. **Engage Italian IP counsel** to send cease and desist letters and evaluate provisional measures\n3. **Consider criminal complaint** to the Guardia di Finanza, which can act quickly against street vendors\n4. **Ensure US copyright registration** is current and timely to preserve statutory damages and attorney's fees eligibility\n5. **Investigate the supply chain** — the vendors likely have a common supplier, and targeting the manufacturer/distributor is more effective\n6. **Consider trademark registration** for the character in both the US and EU (through EUIPO) to create additional enforcement tools\n7. **Monitor online marketplaces** for similar infringing merchandise globally\n\nThis is a situation where your client has strong rights under both legal systems, but the enforcement mechanisms and strategic", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 166, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 4262}, "latency_s": 92.38464499998372, "request_id": "chatcmpl-1599120c-e4f4-4895-b5df-7495bf32e85f", "raw_response": null}
