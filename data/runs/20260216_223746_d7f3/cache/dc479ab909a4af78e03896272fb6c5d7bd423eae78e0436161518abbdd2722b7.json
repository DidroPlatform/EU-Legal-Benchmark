The candidate answer addresses Moral Rights under Section 77 (right to be identified) and states: 'The right to be identified as the author (the \\\"paternity right\\\") of your work when it is published commercially, exhibited, or included in a film or broadcast. However, I must be honest here: this right must be asserted under s.78...'. This directly addresses the condition specified in the rubric criterion by referencing the circumstances under which the right is engaged (publishing commercially/exhibiting in public) and the requirement for assertion, which is linked to the commercial exploitation by the advertiser.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c7044567-39eb-4f9b-b0f9-1e689184f731\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3505, "completion_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 3738}, "latency_s": 1.6529600830108393, "request_id": "IcCUaba2B6iSkdUPusP7uA8", "raw_response": null}
