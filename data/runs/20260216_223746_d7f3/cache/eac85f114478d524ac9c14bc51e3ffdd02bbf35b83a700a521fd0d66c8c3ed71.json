The candidate answer discusses pay transparency, reporting obligations, and various enforcement mechanisms (audits, penalties, lawsuits, etc.). While it mentions the EU Pay Transparency Directive allowing workers to sue if gaps aren't justified, and Iceland's model requiring companies to prove pay equity, it does not explicitly detail the legal mechanism of shifting the burden of proof *after* an employee presents prima facie evidence, which is the core requirement of this specific criterion.
