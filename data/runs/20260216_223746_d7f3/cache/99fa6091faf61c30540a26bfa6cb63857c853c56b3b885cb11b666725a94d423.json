The candidate answer discusses the German court attitude in Section 2, stating they are 'Pro-arbitration (ZPO \\u00a7 1035 et seq.)' and that precedent favors stays. However, it never explicitly cites or mentions ZPO \\u00a7 1032(1) as the specific provision mandating that German courts decline jurisdiction based on the existence of an arbitration agreement. The analysis focuses heavily on English law and the ICC rules, failing to meet the specific statutory citation requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1e1996f6-c1bd-451d-a75c-92f3f6fa6094\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2073, "completion_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 2276}, "latency_s": 33.177179584046826, "request_id": "7zGVaYSKJ4yD7M8PobrS-Ag", "raw_response": null}
