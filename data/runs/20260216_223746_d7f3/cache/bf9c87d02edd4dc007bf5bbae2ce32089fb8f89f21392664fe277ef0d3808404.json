The candidate answer discusses 'Actual Occupation' in the context of overriding interests (LRA 2002, Schedule 3, Para 2) and correctly notes that this usually requires physical presence. However, it focuses heavily on Adverse Possession (which requires a right in the land, but is distinct from actual occupation as an overriding interest) and the failure of the occupation due to absence. It does not explicitly state the legal principle that a claim based on *actual occupation* (as an overriding interest) requires the claimant to have some form of proprietary right or interest in the land that is not merely a personal license, which is the core of the criterion. While the discussion of 'landlord' implies a potential license (which defeats AP), it fails to clearly articulate the requirement for a right in the land for the actual occupation claim itself.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8718243c-5ff0-4b5c-8761-fc13dc640746\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1318, "completion_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 1560}, "latency_s": 23.374519291013712, "request_id": "lEeUadSjIrbzxs0P7LC32Q0", "raw_response": null}
