The candidate answer explicitly rejects the binary choice presented in the prompt, arguing that the two legal problems (tax vs. civil) should be separated. While it discusses the implications of accepting the deal (admitting negligence) on civil liability and suggests alternative negotiation strategies, it does not perform the required expected-value comparison (e.g., calculating the expected cost of taking the deal vs. the expected cost of fighting the deal, incorporating probabilities and quantified financial outcomes for taxes, penalties, and civil judgments). It offers strategic advice instead of the quantitative weighing requested.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a50cf50a-2f7b-4ef0-94de-69b49708857d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1530, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 1731}, "latency_s": 0.8858297079568729, "request_id": "ht6UacSZB8HWxs0P6fe2gQ0", "raw_response": null}
