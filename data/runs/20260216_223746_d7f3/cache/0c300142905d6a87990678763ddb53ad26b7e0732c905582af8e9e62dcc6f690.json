The following analysis is thus qualified and based on standard topics in Swiss corporate law (Obligationenrecht, OR), particularly Arts. 620 ss OR (formation and purpose of companies), 694 OR (objects clause), 716–725 OR (board duties and liability), 954–964c OR (accounting and sustainability reporting), and relevant Federal Supreme Court jurisprudence.\n\n### Position: Partial Disagreement\nI **disagree** with the proposition that profit maximisation constitutes the *one and only one* social responsibility of business. While Swiss law prioritises the pursuit and distribution of profits to shareholders as the *primary* corporate objective, it imposes mandatory legal duties extending beyond pure profit-seeking. These duties reflect broader social responsibilities embedded in the *ordre public économique* (BGE 144 III 434, 439 E. 3), including compliance with environmental, labour, and human rights standards. Non-compliance exposes organs to liability and invalidates corporate acts.\n\n#### 1. Primary Profit Orientation under Swiss Company Law\nSwiss corporate law adopts a **shareholder primacy model**, aligning closely—but not exclusively—with the proposition:\n- **Art. 620 Abs. 2 OR** defines companies (in particular, AG under Arts. 620–763 OR and GmbH under Arts. 772–827 OR) as entities \"formed for the joint pursuit of a commercial operation [...] with the aim of allocating profits to members\". The corporate purpose (*Zweck*, Art. 694 OR) must typically be profit-oriented for commercial enterprises; ideal (*ideelle*) purposes are exceptional and secondary (BGE 138 III 278, 284 E. 3.2, \"Von Roll\").\n- Board members must act in the **company's best interest** (Art. 716 Abs. 1 OR), which coincides with **shareholder interests** during solvency (BGE 133 III 396, 403 E. 4.2). The business judgement rule (Art. 717 Abs. 1 OR; BGE 144 III 434, 439 E. 3) protects decisions aimed at value maximisation, provided they are rational and diligent.\n\nThis supports profit maximisation as the **core** responsibility, provided it respects legal bounds (Friedman's implicit \"rules of the game\").\n\n#### 2. Mandatory Broader Social Responsibilities\nSwiss law contradicts the \"one and only one\" claim by imposing **overriding social duties**:\n- **Compliance Imperative**: Organs must observe *all laws* (Art. 716 Abs. 1 OR; Art. 28 ZGB). Breaches (e.g., environmental pollution under Umweltgesetz, Art. 28a OR; or unfair competition under UWG) trigger liability for damages (Art. 725 Abs. 1 OR) and potential director disqualification (Art. 717a OR). Profit-seeking cannot justify illegality (BGE 140 III 359, 366 E. 3.1).\n- **Stakeholder Protections**:\n  - **Employees**: Mandatory social insurance (UVG, AHVG) and non-discrimination (Art. 328 OR; GlG).\n  - **Creditors**: In over-indebtedness (*Überdeckungsbilanz*, Art. 725 Abs. 2 OR; BGE 138 III 278, 285 E. 3.3), duties shift to creditor protection, prohibiting profit distributions (Art. 680 OR).\n- **Sustainability and Due Diligence** (post-2020 amendments):\n  - **Arts. 954–964c OR** require large AGs/GmbHs to report non-financial matters (environmental, social, human rights risks; Art. 964b OR).\n  - **Arts. 964j–964cc OR** mandate supply-chain due diligence against child labour and conflict minerals, with civil liability for non-compliance (Art. 964z OR). This elevates ESG to a **legal duty**, not mere voluntarism (BGer 4A_222/2023 of 15.5.2024, N. 4.2).\n- **Public Limited Companies**: AGs serve a **social function** (Art. 620 Abs. 1 OR), justifying restrictions like capital maintenance (Arts. 659 OR ss.) to protect third parties.\n\n#### 3. Limits of Shareholder Primacy\n- Ultra vires acts exceeding profit purposes are void (Art. 694 OR), but courts interpret purposes broadly if profit-aligned (BGE 133 III 396, 402 E. 3).\n- No general stakeholder model (unlike § 70 AktG Germany), but insolvency flips priorities (725 Abs. 2 OR).\n\n#### Conclusion\nProfit maximisation is the **paramount** but not **sole** responsibility. Swiss law integrates social duties via mandatory norms, rendering the proposition overly absolutist. Businesses must \"increase profits\" *within* a framework of legal social obligations, lest organs face personal liability (Art. 725 OR). Course-specific emphasis (e.g., on ESG reporting) would refine this, but the qualified shareholder model prevails.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 290, "completion_tokens": 2009, "total_tokens": 2299}, "latency_s": 18.506340166000882, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJN5D3B8H4Y8YAPCJ6DFNW", "raw_response": null}
