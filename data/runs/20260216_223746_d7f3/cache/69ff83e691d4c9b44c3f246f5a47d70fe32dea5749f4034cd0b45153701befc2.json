For many of these KPIs, the response specifies reporting cadences that involve review by the Audit Committee (e.g., Quarterly, Semi-annual, Per event). The structure implies that the Audit Committee is the recipient of the monitoring data, which serves the purpose of verifying control integrity and providing objective oversight. For example, Control 1.1 has KPIs monitored quarterly, and Control 8.2 (Periodic control testing) is explicitly monitored quarterly by the Audit Committee, which aligns with the intent of having an independent assurance function (Internal Audit) report findings to the committee to verify control operation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"433fb637-b97d-41e1-9b0b-5540527c3a48\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3739, "completion_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 3927}, "latency_s": 1.2737264170427807, "request_id": "lR-VaeiJDPjHnsEP9ouZ4Qg", "raw_response": null}
