Section 1.E discusses the worker's rights shirt, noting it 'could be framed as political commentary' and might strengthen a parody/caricature argument, but concludes that 'mass commercial merchandising without authorization is not automatically protected.' Section 1.A identifies unauthorized reproduction/distribution as the primary theory. While the response leans toward analyzing it under parody/political expression exceptions, the underlying act of creating a new version of the character in a different context (worker's rights advocate) for commercial sale is fundamentally the creation of an unauthorized derivative work, which is a copyright violation unless an exception applies. The response frames the analysis around potential defenses (parody/political expression) against the core violation of creating an unauthorized variation, which implies it is a derivative work that needs justification. In the context of a high-level roadmap, stating that unauthorized commercial use of a character in a new context (like the worker's rights advocate) is an infringement (derivative work) that must then be defended by exceptions like parody is consistent with the expected legal analysis, even if the response focuses on the exceptions.\", \"criterion_id\": \"0112e721-9f6a-4b3f-8ed7-559b095bcb35\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2464, "completion_tokens": 304, "total_tokens": 2768}, "latency_s": 1.2698203749605455, "request_id": "nSGVaZmaBNqfnsEPvPyNyAM", "raw_response": null}
