The candidate answer correctly identifies that the convention constitutive determines the regime (public, private, or mixed) and that contributing to public service activities does not prevent private law employment. However, it does not explicitly address the specific condition mentioned in the criterion: whether the GIP's main object being a SPIC *by default* subjects its personnel to private law. While GIPs have flexibility, the criterion points to a specific default rule tied to the SPIC nature, which is not confirmed or denied by the candidate answer in the precise terms requested.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e9f93b00-c174-4505-879b-532c4d69711a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1407, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 1617}, "latency_s": 0.8605572080123238, "request_id": "JEeUaZPWAvjwxN8P54mE4QM", "raw_response": null}
