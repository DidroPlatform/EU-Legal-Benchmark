The candidate answer refers extensively to Section 44 of the Arbitration Act 1996, which deals with the court's power to grant interim measures in support of arbitral proceedings. However, Section 2(3) of the Arbitration Act 1996 deals with the scope of the Act regarding non-domestic arbitration agreements, specifically stating that Part I (which includes s.44) applies to agreements falling within Section 1(3) (which includes foreign-seated arbitrations). While the answer correctly discusses the application of s.44 to foreign seats, it fails to explicitly mention or refer to Section 2(3) as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"27a7166e-59ca-4a59-8eb6-7e17bb61462f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1658, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 1872}, "latency_s": 0.838626665994525, "request_id": "mRmVaf66JbPTvdIPh7q28Qo", "raw_response": null}
