{"provider": "bedrock", "model": "bedrock/converse/openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0", "text": "**Short answer:**  \nIf you are only holding a UK *provisional* licence (the one you use while you’re learning to drive) and you have **not** passed the practical test, you are **not allowed to drive alone** on public roads in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The fact that you also have an “international” licence does not automatically give you the right to drive by yourself unless that licence is a full, valid licence from a country that the UK recognises for resident drivers.  \n\nIf a police officer stops you and determines you are driving without a valid licence for the situation, you will most likely receive a **fixed‑penalty notice (fine and penalty points)** or be **summoned to court**. Arrest is rare for this specific offence unless it is combined with other serious breaches (e.g., driving under the influence, dangerous driving, no insurance, etc.).\n\nBelow is a more detailed breakdown of the factors that matter, what could happen if you’re stopped, and what you should do next.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What “international licence” usually means\n\n| Situation | What the document is | Does it let you drive alone in the UK? |\n|-----------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Visitor** (you’re in the UK for < 12 months) and you hold a **full, valid licence** from an EU/EEA country or a designated non‑EU country (e.g., Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, etc.) | *International Driving Permit (IDP)* **or** just the foreign licence itself (many countries don’t require an IDP). | **Yes**, you may drive as you would at home, provided the licence is still valid, you have appropriate insurance, and you are not a UK resident. |\n| **Resident** (you live in the UK and have been there > 12 months) and you only have a **foreign licence** (no UK licence yet) | You can drive for up to **12 months** after becoming resident, after which you must exchange the licence for a UK one (or pass the UK test). | **Yes**, for the first 12 months only. After that you must have a UK licence. |\n| **Resident** and you have a **foreign licence that is not from a designated country** (e.g., many African, Asian, or South‑American states) | You need to obtain a **UK provisional licence** and then pass the UK theory + practical tests before you can drive. | **No**, you cannot drive alone until you pass the UK test. |\n| **Resident** and you have a **UK provisional licence** (the “learner” licence) | You may drive **only** when accompanied by a qualified driver (≥ 21 years old, has held a full UK licence for ≥ 3 years) and you must display L‑plates. | **No**, you cannot drive alone. |\n\n**Key point:** An “international licence” (often an International Driving Permit) is **not a substitute** for a full UK licence if you are a UK resident who has failed the practical test. It only works as a *visitor* document or for the 12‑month grace period after moving to the UK.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the police can do if they stop you\n\n| Possible police action | Typical circumstances | Likely outcome |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| **Issue a Fixed‑Penalty Notice (FPN)** | You are driving alone on a provisional licence, or you cannot produce a valid licence that authorises solo driving. | £100 fine (or £50 if paid within 21 days) + 3 penalty points on your licence. |\n| **Summon to a Magistrates’ Court** | The officer believes the offence is more serious (e.g., you have no licence at all, you’re driving a vehicle you’re not insured for, or you have multiple offences). | Court may impose a higher fine, more points, or a short disqualification. |\n| **Arrest** | Rare for a simple “driving without a licence” offence, but possible if combined with: <br>• Driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs <br>• Dangerous or reckless driving <br>• No insurance/road tax <br>• Outstanding warrants or other criminal matters | You would be taken to a police station, charged, and could face a court trial. |\n| **Vehicle seizure** | No valid insurance or road tax, or the vehicle is being used in a way that breaches the law (e.g., unroadworthy). | Vehicle may be impounded; you’ll have to pay release fees. |\n\n**In practice:** Most first‑time offenders caught driving alone on a provisional licence receive an FPN rather than being arrested. However, the police *can* arrest you if they think you pose a safety risk or if you have additional violations.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What the law actually says (UK)\n\n- **Road Traffic Act 1988, s. 87** – It is an offence to drive a motor vehicle on a road without a valid licence authorising you to do so.\n- **The Highway Code, Rule 5** – Learners must be accompanied by a qualified driver and display L‑plates.\n- **DVLA guidance** – A foreign licence is only valid for driving in the UK for up to 12 months after you become a resident, after which you must obtain a UK licence (or pass the UK test).\n\nIf you have *only* a UK provisional licence and have **failed** the practical test, you **do not have a valid licence to drive alone**. The presence of an International Driving Permit or a foreign licence does **not** change that, unless you meet the visitor/12‑month resident criteria described above.\n\n---\n\n## 4. What you should do right now\n\n1. **Do NOT drive home alone.**  \n   The safest legal choice is to arrange alternative transport (taxi, rideshare, public transport, a friend/family member with a full licence, etc.).\n\n2. **Check the exact status of your foreign licence.**  \n   - Is it a *full* licence (not a learner’s licence) from a country on the UK’s recognised list?  \n   - Have you been resident in the UK for more than 12 months?  \n   - Is the licence still valid (not expired, not suspended)?\n\n3. **If you are a resident and the foreign licence is still valid:**  \n   - You may drive for up to 12 months after moving to the UK.  \n   - Make sure you have **valid insurance** that covers you driving the car.  \n   - Carry both the foreign licence *and* the International Driving Permit (if required) when you drive.\n\n4. **If you are a resident and the foreign licence is *not* from a designated country, or you have been in the UK > 12 months:**  \n   - You must obtain a **UK provisional licence** and **pass the UK practical test** before you can drive alone.  \n   - Until then, you can only drive with a qualified supervising driver.\n\n5. **If you are a visitor (you’ve been in the UK < 12 months):**  \n   - Your foreign licence (or IDP) is fine for solo driving, provided you have insurance.  \n   - Keep the licence and any supporting documents (IDP, passport) with you.\n\n6. **If you’re unsure, call the DVLA or a local Citizens Advice Bureau** for a quick clarification. They can confirm whether your specific foreign licence is accepted for solo driving.\n\n---\n\n## 5. What to expect if you *are* stopped\n\n| Situation | What to say to the officer | What to hand over |\n|-----------|----------------------------|-------------------|\n| You have a UK provisional licence only | “I’m a learner and I’m aware I need a supervising driver. I’m sorry, I made a mistake.” | Show your provisional licence. |\n| You have a foreign full licence + IDP | “I have a full licence from [Country] and an International Driving Permit. I’m a resident for less than 12 months.” | Show both documents, plus passport/visa to prove residency length. |\n| You have no licence at all | “I’m sorry, I don’t have a licence that allows me to drive alone.” | You may be given an FPN or a court summons. |\n\n**Tip:** Remain calm, be polite, and do not argue. If you receive a Fixed‑Penalty Notice, you can usually pay it online within 21 days for a reduced amount. If you think the notice is wrong (e.g., you *do* have a valid foreign licence), you can contest it in court, but you’ll need evidence (photocopies of the licence, proof of residency dates, insurance policy, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick checklist before you ever get behind the wheel again\n\n| ✔️ | Item |\n|---|------|\n| **Licence status** – Is it a full UK licence, a valid foreign licence, or just a provisional? |\n| **Residency length** – < 12 months as a visitor? > 12 months as a resident? |\n| **Insurance** – Does your policy cover you driving the specific vehicle with your current licence? |\n| **Vehicle tax & MOT** – Is the car road‑worthy and legally taxed? |\n| **Supervising driver** – If you’re on a provisional, is a qualified driver with you and are L‑plates displayed? |\n| **Documentation** – Carry licence(s), IDP (if needed), insurance certificate, MOT/TAX documents. |\n\nIf any of those boxes are red, arrange another way home and sort the paperwork before you drive again.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Bottom line\n\n- **No, you are unlikely to be *arrested* simply for driving alone on a provisional licence**, but you *will* be committing an offence and can be fined, receive penalty points, or be taken to court.\n- **If your foreign licence is a full, valid licence from a recognised country and you are still within the 12‑month resident/visitor window, you *can* drive alone** (provided you have insurance).  \n- **If you are a UK resident who has failed the practical test and only have a provisional licence, you must not drive alone**. Use a taxi, rideshare, public transport, or ask a qualified driver to accompany you.\n\n---\n\n### Need more help?\n\n- **DVLA (Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency)** – 0300 790 6801 or visit https://www.gov.uk/contact-the-dvla  \n- **Citizens Advice** – 0800 144 8848 or https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk  \n- **Local police non‑emergency line** – 101 (for general queries about traffic stops).  \n\nStay safe, and good luck with your next attempt at the practical test! 🚗💨", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 103, "completion_tokens": 2557, "total_tokens": 2660}, "latency_s": 10.787698500003899, "request_id": "chatcmpl-7c783363-f60a-4188-a59f-55c348290f94", "raw_response": null}
