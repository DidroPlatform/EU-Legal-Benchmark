The candidate answer argues the opposite: that the drunk driver's swerve *was* the operative cause and *broke* the chain of causation originating from the truck driver (D2), because the swerve was grossly negligent and criminal (double the limit). The candidate explicitly argues that D1's swerve was a *novus actus interveniens* breaking D2's chain, rather than arguing that D1's reaction was an unreasonable intervention that *D2* should have foreseen, which is what the criterion seems to imply by focusing on what a 'reasonable person' would have done in response to the chair.\", \"criterion_id\": \"59f0e49d-855e-44f4-bd5f-6e656891aa30\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1737, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 1971}, "latency_s": 1.0092867499915883, "request_id": "UzGVadDhFdiCkdUPj_-PiQM", "raw_response": null}
