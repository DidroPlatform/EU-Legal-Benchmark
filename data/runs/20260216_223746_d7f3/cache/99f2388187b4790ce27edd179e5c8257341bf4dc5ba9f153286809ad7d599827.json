B was born on 30.11.2003, making him 18 on 30.11.2021. The robbery on 10.12.2021 was committed when he was already 18, so adult criminal law applies to that offense. For the earlier offense (10.11.2021), he was still 17, so juvenile law applies. However, the statement says the case was referred to the juvenile investigation authority already handling B's case. Under Art. 15 JStG, a closed placement (Unterbringung) requires that the juvenile has committed a crime (Verbrechen) connected to the disorder. The simple bodily harm (Art. 123) is a Vergehen, not a Verbrechen. The robbery was committed when B was 18. So the prerequisites for ordering closed placement under juvenile law are questionable. Actually, looking more carefully: Art. 15 Abs. 2 JStG requires a Verbrechen for closed placement. The robbery (Art. 140 StGB) is a Verbrechen, but B committed it at age 18. The bodily harm committed at 17 is only a Vergehen. So closed placement cannot be properly ordered under juvenile law. This statement is **false**.\\n\\n**Statement ii:** Nico is 17 and committed armed robbery (Raub, Art. 140 StGB - a Verbrechen). A forensic assessment found a significant personality development disorder with high recidivism risk. The statement says the investigating officer (Untersuchungsbeamter) wants to order a placement. Under Art. 15 JStG, a placement can be ordered, and under Art. 15 Abs. 2 JStG, closed placement requires a Verbrechen connected to the disorder. Nico committed a Verbrechen (robbery). However, the statement says the 'Untersuchungsbeamter' wants to order the placement - but under juvenile criminal procedure, it is the juvenile court (Jugendgericht) that orders placements, not the investigating officer. Also, regarding competence: Nico is officially registered in Bazenheid (municipality in St. Gallen canton) but lives with grandparents in Winterthur. Under Art. 10 JStPO, jurisdiction is at the place of habitual residence. This could be Winterthur. The statement says closed placement 'kann angeordnet werden' - the conditions under Art. 15 Abs. 2 JStG appear met (Verbrechen + disorder + recidivism risk). But the procedural issue about who orders it makes this potentially misleading. The statement itself says 'Der geschlossene Vollzug kann angeordnet werden' which is correct substantively. Actually, wait - the statement says the Untersuchungsbeamter 'will eine Unterbringung anordnen' - the investigating officer cannot order this; only the court can. But the final sentence just says closed placement 'can be ordered' which is true in principle. The statement might be considered false because of the procedural irregularity implied, or it could be read as two separate claims. On balance, the substantive conclusion about closed placement being possible seems correct, but the procedural aspect is wrong. This makes statement ii **false** or at least problematic.\\n\\n**Statement iii:** The claim is that parents are obligated (verpflichtet) to participate in the police questioning of their children. Under Art. 14 Abs. 1 JStPO, parents have the RIGHT (Recht) to participate, but they are not OBLIGATED to do so. The statement says 'verpflichtet' which is incorrect - it's a right, not an obligation. This statement is **false**.\\n\\nAll three statements contain false claims, so the answer is A.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1686, "completion_tokens": 919, "total_tokens": 2605}, "latency_s": 18.947989125008462, "request_id": "chatcmpl-e101df92-b2ed-494c-947f-de34b2c79426", "raw_response": null}
