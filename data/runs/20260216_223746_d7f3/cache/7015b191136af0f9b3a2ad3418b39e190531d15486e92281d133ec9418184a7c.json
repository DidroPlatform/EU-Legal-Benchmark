The candidate answer discusses adverse possession and 'tolerated trespasser' status, which are related to occupation rights, but it completely fails to mention the concept of overriding interests in relation to a disponee (new buyer) and the test of 'actual occupation being obvious on a reasonably careful inspection' (which relates to Schedule 3, paragraph 2 of the Land Registration Act 2002, concerning interests that override a registered disposition).
