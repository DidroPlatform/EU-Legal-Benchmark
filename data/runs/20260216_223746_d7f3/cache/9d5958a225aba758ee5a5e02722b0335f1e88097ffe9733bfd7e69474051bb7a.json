The candidate answer explicitly lists 'Protective Provisions (Veto Rights on Major Decisions)' in Tier 3 and advises against them for a 25% stake, suggesting they are a 'Nice-to-Have' and that the user should avoid them or limit them severely, rather than prioritizing them as critical for safeguarding the minority position. While it mentions veto rights, it frames them as something to negotiate away or minimize, directly contradicting the implication that this is a critical, prioritized safeguard.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5338cca4-c534-4f4b-a075-0e5f76bd33cd\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2660, "completion_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 2844}, "latency_s": 0.8494292079703882, "request_id": "gt2UaYiMBOCO28oPzLWAmAE", "raw_response": null}
