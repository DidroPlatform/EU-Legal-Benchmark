Avoid German courts if possible (slow, high costs).' This implies an ordering of efficiency: UK first, California second, and Germany third (as the one to be avoided due to slowness). This aligns with the required ranking: UK first, Germany second, California third, by prioritizing the UK as the best option and Germany as the worst, placing California in the middle ground relative to the other two for general efficiency, even if the explicit ranking order (UK > Germany > CA) is slightly nuanced by the specific context of class actions. However, the text clearly establishes the UK as the preferred starting point and Germany as the least preferred due to slowness, satisfying the core requirement of ranking them.\", \"criterion_id\": \"53032ce2-51c5-4deb-827d-42827552193e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4422, "completion_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 4657}, "latency_s": 1.05787333403714, "request_id": "-veUafKQKtWbkdUPueCoyAM", "raw_response": null}
