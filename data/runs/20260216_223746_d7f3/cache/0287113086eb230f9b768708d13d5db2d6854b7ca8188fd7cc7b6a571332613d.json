He claims he acted in self-defence, having struck the victim with a piece of broken glass only after being attacked and genuinely (but mistakenly) believing the victim was armed.' Furthermore, Section 4.A.2 confirms this by stating the client 'did not have to wait to be struck first if they genuinely believe an attack is imminent,' and Section 5.A.1 notes the strength of the defence is based on the client's account that he was attacked first. This directly satisfies the criterion that the defence is predicated on the assertion that the victim was the initial aggressor.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e0d48875-215e-49bc-821a-74d262e701ae\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4163, "completion_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 4356}, "latency_s": 1.02171391696902, "request_id": "QfeUace1Kf7MkdUP7NXHmAk", "raw_response": null}
