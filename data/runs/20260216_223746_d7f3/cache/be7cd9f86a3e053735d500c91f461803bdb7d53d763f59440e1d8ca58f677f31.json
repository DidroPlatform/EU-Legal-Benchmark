Article 260 TFEU relates to the consequences of a Member State failing to comply with a judgment of the CJEU (i.e., imposing financial penalties). The relevant article for the Commission opening infringement proceedings (which leads to the CJEU) is Article 258 TFEU, which mentions the 'reasoned opinion' stage before referral to the CJEU. The candidate answer mentions Article 258 TFEU in Section 3.2, stating: \\\"If the issue is not resolved, it can issue a *Reasoned Opinion* and eventually refer the case to the CJEU.\\\" However, the criterion specifically asks about Article 260. Since the candidate answer mentions Article 258 and not Article 260, the criterion is not satisfied as written.\", \"criterion_id\": \"907f387c-b479-4902-901e-f92c1335f5b9\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3858, "completion_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 4107}, "latency_s": 0.9088272919761948, "request_id": "DeWUaczrBKaGxN8PueC3gQs", "raw_response": null}
