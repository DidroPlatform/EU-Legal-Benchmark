The candidate answer discusses Section 163(j) (interest deduction limitation), Section 267A (interest disallowance), BEAT (Section 59A), and Section 385 regulations (recharacterization risk for related-party debt). While Section 385 regulations deal with debt vs. equity characterization, the response does not explicitly mention the 'thin capitalization doctrine' (which is often associated with domestic or foreign country rules limiting debt based on a debt-to-equity ratio, though U.S. rules like Section 385 serve a similar function). Since the criterion specifically asks for the mention of the 'thin capitalization doctrine,' and the response uses modern U.S. statutory references (like Section 385) instead of the specific doctrine name, it does not strictly satisfy the criterion as written.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8fdccc9f-9087-40ec-b39f-52d653aca87b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3228, "completion_tokens": 252, "total_tokens": 3480}, "latency_s": 1.0451977079792414, "request_id": "QdSUadObG6iSkdUPusP7uA8", "raw_response": null}
