It discusses the legal requirements for an NAI to break the chain of causation (unforeseeable, voluntary, independent) and applies this concept separately to the actions of the drunk driver (D1) and the truck driver (D2). The analysis concludes that D1's grossly negligent swerve likely constitutes an NAI that breaks the chain for the truck driver (D2), while D1's own chain remains intact.
