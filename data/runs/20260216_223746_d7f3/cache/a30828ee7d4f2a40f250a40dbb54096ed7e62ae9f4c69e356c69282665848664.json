However, I need to verify if this is planned for the Swiss IPRG draft. This statement appears to be TRUE.\n\n**Statement ii:** About a testamentary executor distributing assets. The executor distributes bank assets among 5 heirs, then proposes a jewelry distribution that 4 heirs accept but 1 rejects. The executor proceeds with the distribution according to the 4 consenting heirs and informs the supervisory authority that the execution is complete.\n\nThe key issue: Can the supervisory authority declare the end of the testamentary execution when there's still a dispute? According to Swiss law, a testamentary executor cannot unilaterally end their duties when there are unresolved disputes. The executor acted improperly by distributing against one heir's wishes and declaring the execution complete. The supervisory authority cannot simply accept this declaration when the execution is incomplete. This statement appears to be FALSE.\n\n**Statement iii:** Claims that the law applicable under EuErbVO must be the law of a Member State, thus no erga omnes effect.\n\nThis is FALSE. The EuErbVO has universal application (Art. 20) - it applies erga omnes, meaning the law designated by the regulation applies even if it's the law of a non-Member State. This is a fundamental principle of the regulation.\n\nTherefore, statements ii and iii are false.\n\n{\"answer\": \"C\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement ii is false because the executor cannot unilaterally end duties with unresolved disputes, and the supervisory authority cannot declare completion in such circumstances. Statement iii is false because the EuErbVO has universal (erga omnes) application under Art. 20, applying even to non-Member State law.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 643, "completion_tokens": 465, "total_tokens": 1108}, "latency_s": 8.956126582983416, "request_id": "chatcmpl-2e7e5544-a964-41e6-80c3-d8af6486ed27", "raw_response": null}
