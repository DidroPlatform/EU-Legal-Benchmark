{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 0, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion specifically requires confirmation that the Reporting Cadence for the GAAR Defense control is set at a minimum frequency of quarterly updates to the Audit Committee. The candidate answer lists two controls related to GAAR (Control 5 and Control 6). Control 5 (Transaction GAAR Pre-Approval Gate) has a 'Reporting Cadence' of 'Quarterly (pipeline dashboard)'. Control 6 (Substance-over-Form Testing) has a reporting cadence of 'Annually (with semi-annual progress updates)'. While one GAAR control is reported quarterly, the criterion implies a singular, highly critical GAAR Defense control should have a minimum quarterly cadence. Control 5 satisfies this, but the criterion implies a specific control point named 'GAAR Defense control' should meet this. Since Control 5 is explicitly quarterly, it meets the minimum frequency requirement for at least one relevant control. However, the criterion implies a single, overarching 'GAAR Defense control' reporting quarterly. Given the structure, Control 5 satisfies the minimum quarterly reporting frequency for a GAAR-related control, but the phrasing of the criterion is slightly ambiguous regarding which specific control it refers to. Control 5 is the most relevant operational control for ongoing GAAR defense reporting and is quarterly. I will mark this as satisfied because the most relevant ongoing GAAR control (Transaction Pre-Approval Gate) reports quarterly.\", \"criterion_id\": \"31bc88c7-9bb4-4cb0-a9f5-8499628bdaf1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1473, "completion_tokens": 328, "total_tokens": 1801}, "latency_s": 25.137812957982533, "request_id": "vjKVabT6J_ujkdUP0fjD0QU", "raw_response": null}
