Section 7, step 3 states: \\\"Ask for explicit consent (as described in \\u00a73.1). If a member refuses, **delete** their data without delay.\\\" This directly addresses the requirement of deleting data when consent is not obtained. However, the overall context of the answer is about what *should* have been done (informing members), and the instruction to delete data is presented as a remedial step for data already collected without consent, not as a general rule for data processing going forward. Since the criterion asks if the response *states* this action should be taken (which it does, in the remedial section), it is technically satisfied. However, given the strict nature of the rubric, I will re-evaluate based on the context of the remedial action. The response explicitly states: \\\"If a member refuses [to give consent], **delete** their data without delay.\\\" This fulfills the requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"bef281c1-a097-4fe4-a4b5-3d7adc42596d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4421, "completion_tokens": 262, "total_tokens": 4683}, "latency_s": 1.4283561669872142, "request_id": "MuaUaebUFuCO28oPzLWAmAE", "raw_response": null}
