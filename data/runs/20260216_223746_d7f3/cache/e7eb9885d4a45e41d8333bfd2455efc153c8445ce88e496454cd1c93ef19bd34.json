It correctly identifies the relevant jurisdictions (Norway, Ireland/EU, US, India) and the nexus points for legal application. The structure is logical, and the analysis of risks and mitigation measures is detailed and accurate, closely mirroring the key points in the reference answer (e.g., GDPR scope, CLOUD Act conflict, extraterritorial bribery laws). The inclusion of analogous Swiss law concepts, while not strictly required by the prompt, demonstrates depth, but the core analysis remains focused on the applicable foreign laws as dictated by the facts. The reference answer is slightly more concise in its structure, but the candidate provides superior depth on the specific legal frameworks (e.g., citing specific US/UK/Norwegian statutes and Indian acts).\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.95}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2367, "completion_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 2595}, "latency_s": 0.9903835420263931, "request_id": "LjaVafaQC-yOkdUP_ZOcgQk", "raw_response": null}
