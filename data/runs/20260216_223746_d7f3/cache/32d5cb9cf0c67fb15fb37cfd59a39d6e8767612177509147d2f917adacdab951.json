The candidate answer states that if the BIT is silent, tribunals typically 'do not infer consent' and cites cases where counterclaims were declined due to silence (*Saluka*, *Roussalis*). However, the answer immediately pivots to discussing cases where counterclaims *were* accepted (*Urbaser*, *Perenco*) based on broad treaty language, suggesting admissibility is highly dependent on the specific wording, rather than a general rule of inadmissibility based solely on silence. The conclusion section states, 'Consent is the biggest hurdle: If the BIT is silent, tribunals usually decline jurisdiction over counterclaims (*Saluka*, *Roussalis*).' This supports the criterion, but the overall structure presents a balanced view where admissibility is possible even without express mention, provided the language is broad enough. Since the response does not make a clear, unqualified assertion that they are *usually* inadmissible unless expressly mentioned, but rather details the nuanced tests that often lead to inadmissibility in silent treaties, it does not perfectly align with the strict assertion required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"191e67ef-7b2a-4b3a-a1e2-fe9e20a8a0b8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3009, "completion_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 3297}, "latency_s": 1.5890980830299668, "request_id": "p_2UaZKtLvjHnsEP9ouZ4Qg", "raw_response": null}
