The candidate answer states: 'The DUP boycotted Stormont (2022\\u201324) over the Protocol, arguing it undermined NI\\u2019s place in the UK.' and later: 'DUP\\u2019s Problem: They argued the Protocol (pre-WF) made NI too aligned with the EU, undermining its place in the UK.' While the answer correctly identifies the DUP boycott timing (2022-2024) and the reason (objection to the Protocol/customs checks), it attributes the start of the boycott to the Protocol generally, rather than specifically linking the February 2022 start date to the objection over checks, as the criterion specifies. However, the context provided in Section 6 clearly links the boycott to the Protocol's implications regarding UK alignment and customs checks, which is the core of the criterion's intent. The answer is factually accurate regarding the DUP's motivation for the boycott.\", \"criterion_id\": \"90be4298-6097-4725-81fc-cddffb2c4148\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2978, "completion_tokens": 300, "total_tokens": 3278}, "latency_s": 1.191491874982603, "request_id": "TAGVacrRJ7njnsEPxoKX6AU", "raw_response": null}
