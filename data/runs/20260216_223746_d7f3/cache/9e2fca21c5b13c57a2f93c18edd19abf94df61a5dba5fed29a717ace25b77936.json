The candidate answer discusses the bank having 'actual or constructive notice' of the equitable interest (Section 2, Theory 3), which is related to inquiry, but it does not specifically address the concept of an 'overriding interest' binding a purchaser/lender due to a failure to inquire about *occupiers* (a concept highly relevant in jurisdictions like England & Wales, which the answer references). The answer focuses on notice of the *equitable interest* itself, not the specific mechanism of an overriding interest binding a lender due to occupation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"94c14c26-3d41-4b09-abe3-a18f253ce007\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4192, "completion_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 4388}, "latency_s": 1.0202161250053905, "request_id": "yumUafHgAsLmvdIPgciGgQQ", "raw_response": null}
