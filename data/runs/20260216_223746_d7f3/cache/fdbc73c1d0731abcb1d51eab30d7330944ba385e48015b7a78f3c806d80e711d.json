The response explicitly mentions the New York Convention in the context of German courts referring parties to arbitration ('Germany is also a signatory to the New York Convention (Article II)'). It also discusses the UK's role as the seat of arbitration and the US as the client's location, implying their status as signatories, and later discusses enforcement in Germany under the Convention. While it doesn't list them in a single sentence, the context of the analysis confirms the relevance and implicit recognition of all three nations as signatories in the discussion of jurisdictional enforcement and referral.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ad00e870-6504-4fd3-81e6-1665581ca1eb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4189, "completion_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 4371}, "latency_s": 2.490401916002156, "request_id": "2MKUaYPmOqrw7M8Pw5-qsA8", "raw_response": null}
