The candidate answer addresses the burden of proof under the Windsor Framework, stating that goods from GB to NI are presumed NOT at risk (green lane) unless there are reasonable grounds to suspect diversion to the EU. Crucially, under the section 'Burden of Proof: \\\"Goods at Risk of Being Imported into the EU\\\"', it discusses third-country goods and the general risk assessment, which inherently covers goods intended for processing and onward supply to the EU. While it doesn't use the exact phrasing 'processed in NI to become parts of products', the entire framework hinges on whether goods (including components/materials) are destined for the EU market (Red Lane) or staying in the UK (Green Lane). The distinction between Green Lane (staying in UK/NI) and Red Lane (destined for Ireland/EU) covers the scenario where materials imported into NI are intended for onward supply/importation into the EU. The candidate explicitly mentions that goods destined for Ireland/EU fall under the Red Lane, which is the mechanism that captures goods intended for onward supply/importation into the EU, fulfilling the spirit and function of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"fc71b680-fd6e-4d06-9a32-d540462c9927\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2714, "completion_tokens": 320, "total_tokens": 3034}, "latency_s": 2.0596838330384344, "request_id": "uzOVaYfALcPwnsEPpffzuQM", "raw_response": null}
