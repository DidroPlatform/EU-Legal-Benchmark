The candidate answer discusses the German firm's potential claim for reputational damages under German tort law (§ 823(1) BGB) and focuses heavily on jurisdictional issues (seat of arbitration, anti-suit injunctions, scope of the arbitration clause). While the answer discusses damages under Delaware law for the client's counterclaim (lost profits requiring 'reasonable certainty'), it fails to analyze the specific Delaware law requirements for the *German firm's* claim for reputational damages, which is the focus of this criterion. The required elements (foreseeability, exclusion by contract, reasonable certainty) specific to Delaware law regarding reputational damages are not mentioned.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b891ecd1-29ed-48ab-b657-193a39d276ac\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4210, "completion_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 4443}, "latency_s": 1.8835660420008935, "request_id": "N8OUaZCAFJzzkdUP1oOSgAU", "raw_response": null}
