The candidate answer uses strong language like 'very likely to be copyright infringements' and 'a court would likely find infringement', but it stops short of providing an absolute guarantee of success ('definitively win'). It frames the advice as a strong likelihood based on current law and practical steps, which is appropriate for legal guidance in this context, rather than a definitive, guaranteed outcome. Therefore, it does not strictly violate the prohibition against definitive certainty.\", \"criterion_id\": \"af0844b4-4ee3-4cff-b350-06d4ae66eeb3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4251, "completion_tokens": 164, "total_tokens": 4415}, "latency_s": 3.3274546249886043, "request_id": "9-yUabzQKs_rvdIPudyEkAw", "raw_response": null}
