The list is grouped by the legal duties that arise under the **Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (the “Fire Safety Order”)**, the **Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HSWA)** and the **Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (EAWR)** (which underpins PAT testing).  \n\n| Area | Evidence you should be able to produce | Why it matters (legal basis) | Advantages of having it | Disadvantages / pitfalls |\n|------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **a) Identification of the “Responsible Person” (RP)** | • Written declaration (e.g. board resolution) naming the company (or a senior director) as the RP for the out‑building. <br>• Copies of the lease/ licence agreement showing the RP’s duties over the shared space. | Fire Safety Order – the RP must “ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety of any persons who may be affected by a fire”. | Gives a clear chain of accountability; makes it easier to demonstrate that you accepted the statutory duty. | If the RP is not clearly documented, regulators may argue the duty fell to the occupier (the neighbour) or to both parties, diluting your defence. |\n| **b) Up‑to‑date Fire Risk Assessment (FRA)** | • Original third‑party FRA report (date, assessor’s qualifications, scope). <br>• Any subsequent revisions (e.g. after the fire, after equipment changes). <br>• Minutes of the review meeting where the FRA was approved. | Fire Safety Order – you must carry out a *suitable and sufficient* fire risk assessment and keep it under review. | Shows you relied on a competent assessor; provides a baseline for “reasonable steps”. | If the FRA does not mention PAT testing or the specific equipment that caused the fire, you may be deemed to have *failed to identify a significant risk*. |\n| **c) Maintenance & Inspection Records for Fire‑Safety Installations** | • Logbooks for fire alarms, detectors, sprinklers, extinguishers (date of test, service provider, any remedial work). <br>• Certificates of compliance for fire doors, compartmentation, means of escape. | Fire Safety Order – you must maintain fire‑detection and fire‑extinguishing equipment in efficient working order. | Demonstrates ongoing diligence; can be used to rebut claims of “poor maintenance”. | Gaps in the log (e.g. missing test dates) can be interpreted as neglect. |\n| **d) Electrical Safety & PAT‑Testing Programme** | • Written PAT‑testing policy (frequency, scope, responsible person). <br>• Records of PAT tests for *all* equipment stored/used in the out‑building (date, tester, result, corrective action). <br>• Evidence that the policy was communicated to the neighbouring co‑tenant (e‑mail, meeting minutes). | EAWR 1989 – any electrical equipment must be maintained to prevent danger. <br>HSWA s.2(1) – duty to ensure safety of persons “so far as is reasonably practicable”. | Shows you had a systematic approach to electrical safety; can shift blame if the neighbour ignored the policy. | If the policy only covered *your* equipment, you may be seen as having failed to control hazards introduced by the co‑tenant. |\n| **e) Lease / Shared‑Use Agreement** | • Full copy of the lease (or licence) for the out‑building, highlighting clauses on: <br>   – Allocation of fire‑safety responsibilities <br>   – Requirement for PAT testing of any equipment brought in <br>   – Insurance and indemnity provisions. | The contract can be used to allocate duties between you and the neighbour, but it does **not** relieve the RP of statutory duties. | Provides a contractual basis to argue the neighbour breached the lease. | If the lease is vague or silent on fire safety, the regulator may deem the RP (you) still responsible for the whole space. |\n| **f) Training & Communication** | • Training registers for your staff (fire‑warden training, evacuation drills, use of extinguishers). <br>• Copies of any joint safety briefings with the neighbour (agenda, attendance). <br>• Sign‑posting (e.g. “No unauthorised equipment – PAT testing required”). | Fire Safety Order – you must provide adequate fire‑safety training and information to anyone who may be affected. | Shows proactive risk communication; can mitigate “failure to warn” arguments. | If the neighbour’s staff never attended your training, you may still be liable for not ensuring they were *informed* of the hazards. |\n| **g) Emergency Procedures & Evacuation Plans** | • Up‑to‑date evacuation diagram for the out‑building (including shared routes). <br>• Records of regular fire drills (date, participants, observations). | Fire Safety Order – you must have appropriate means of escape and emergency procedures. | Demonstrates preparedness; may reduce culpability for the loss of life if the victim could not evacuate due to the fire’s rapid spread. | If drills were not conducted or the plan omitted the neighbour’s occupants, the RP may be found negligent. |\n| **h) Incident‑Investigation & Corrective‑Action Log** | • Immediate post‑fire investigation report (root‑cause analysis, photographs, witness statements). <br>• List of corrective actions taken (e.g., removal of unauthorised equipment, revised PAT policy). | HSWA s.2(2) – duty to “review and revise” safety measures after an incident. | Shows you acted promptly to prevent recurrence – a mitigating factor. | Failure to produce a thorough investigation can be taken as evidence of a *culture of non‑compliance*. |\n| **i) Insurance & Legal Counsel** | • Copy of public‑liability / employer’s liability policy covering fire. <br>• Correspondence with legal counsel regarding the fire‑risk assessment and lease obligations. | Not a statutory defence, but insurers often require proof of compliance before paying. | Helps demonstrate that you took the risk seriously and sought professional advice. | Over‑reliance on insurance can be viewed as “pay‑off” rather than genuine safety management. |\n| **j) Health‑and‑Safety Management System (HSMS)** (if you have one) | • Policy statement, risk‑assessment hierarchy, audit reports, management‑review minutes. | HSWA – requires a systematic approach to managing health and safety. | Provides a “big‑picture” defence that fire safety is embedded in your overall HSMS. | If the HSMS is a “paper‑only” exercise with no implementation, it adds little weight. |\n\n### How to present the evidence\n\n1. **Binder / electronic folder** titled *“Fire‑Safety Diligence – Out‑building (Shared) – 2023‑2026”* containing the above items in chronological order.  \n2. **Executive summary** (2‑3 pages) that maps each statutory duty to the specific piece(s) of evidence you have.  \n3. **Gap‑analysis** (if any) – acknowledge any missing items, explain why they were not required or why they were mitigated by other controls.  \n\nRegulators (London Fire Brigade, Health & Safety Executive) and the CPS will look for **both the existence of controls and the reasonableness of the process** that led to their implementation. The above package demonstrates that you:\n\n* Identified the legal duty (RP) and documented it.  \n* Engaged a competent third‑party assessor and kept the FRA under review.  \n* Established a written PAT‑testing policy and communicated it to the co‑tenant.  \n* Maintained fire‑safety plant and carried out regular training/drills.  \n* Recorded all actions and responded promptly after the incident.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Advantages & Disadvantages of the Steps You Took (and of the *lack* of some steps)\n\n| Step | Advantage (if done correctly) | Disadvantage (if omitted or poorly done) |\n|------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Third‑party fire‑risk assessment** | • Independent expertise reduces the risk of “blind spots”. <br>• Provides a defensible “reasonable steps” benchmark. | • If the assessor’s scope omitted electrical equipment, you may be criticised for *relying* on an incomplete report. <br>• Over‑reliance can be seen as *delegating* your statutory duty. |\n| **Written PAT‑testing policy** | • Shows you recognised the electrical risk and set a systematic control. <br>• Allows you to point to a specific breach by the neighbour. | • If the policy only covered *your* equipment, you may still be liable for hazards introduced by the neighbour. |\n| **Lease clauses allocating fire‑safety duties** | • Provides contractual backup for enforcement (e.g., you could have required the neighbour to carry out PAT testing). | • A lease cannot *override* the statutory duty of the RP; vague clauses can be ignored by regulators. |\n| **Joint safety briefings / shared‑space signage** | • Demonstrates proactive communication and shared‑responsibility culture. | • If you failed to document attendance, the briefings may be deemed ineffective. |\n| **Regular fire drills including neighbour’s staff** | • Evidence that evacuation routes were known, reducing the chance of loss of life. | • If drills were not inclusive, you may be found negligent for not ensuring the safety of *all* occupants. |\n| **Immediate post‑fire investigation** | • Shows compliance with HSWA s.2(2) and can identify systemic failures. | • Delayed or superficial investigation can be interpreted as a cover‑up. |\n| **Insurance & legal counsel** | • Shows you sought professional advice, which can be a mitigating factor. | • Insurance does not excuse statutory non‑compliance; insurers may refuse to pay if you are found criminally liable. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Who is **primarily to blame** for the fire and the resulting death?\n\n### 3.1  Statutory duties & potential breaches\n\n| Legal source | Duty | Potential breach by **your company** | Potential breach by **neighbouring company** |\n|--------------|------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Fire Safety Order 2005** (Reg 6) | RP must ensure fire safety “so far as is reasonably practicable”. | • Failure to ensure that *all* equipment in the out‑building (including that of the neighbour) was safe and PAT‑tested. <br>• Failure to keep the FRA up‑to‑date with the presence of the neighbour’s equipment. | • Failure to comply with any contractual/legally‑imposed requirement to PAT‑test equipment before use. |\n| **Health and Safety at Work Act 1974** (s.2(1)) | Duty to protect the health and safety of employees and other persons “so far as is reasonably practicable”. | • Same as above – not taking reasonable steps to control the electrical hazard. | • Duty to ensure its own equipment is safe for use; breach if it introduced a dangerous electrical short. |\n| **Electricity at Work Regulations 1989** (Reg 4) | All electrical equipment must be maintained to prevent danger. | • If you had a contractual right to control equipment in the shared space and failed to enforce it, you may be deemed to have *allowed* a breach of the EAWR. | • Direct breach – equipment was not PAT‑tested, creating an unsafe condition. |\n| **Building Regulations (Approved Document B – Fire Safety)** | Requires fire‑resistance of structure, means of escape, fire detection. | • If the out‑building’s fire‑detection system was inadequate for the type/quantity of stored product, you could be in breach. | • Not directly applicable unless the neighbour altered the building fabric. |\n| **Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007** | Corporate liability where gross breach of duty leads to death. | • If the breach is deemed *gross* (e.g., you ignored a clear risk that equipment was not PAT‑tested), you could face corporate manslaughter charges. | • If the neighbour’s breach is the *sole* cause, they could be prosecuted for corporate manslaughter. |\n| **Criminal Damage Act 1971 / CPS policy** | Fire causing death can be charged as *Corporate Manslaughter* or *Corporate Homicide*; also *Fire‑related offences* under the Fire Safety Order. | • Potential charge of “failure to ensure fire safety” (offence under the Fire Safety Order). | • Potential charge of “failure to ensure electrical safety” (offence under EAWR) and/or “causing death by fire”. |\n\n### 3.2  Likely allocation of blame\n\n| Factor | Weight in assigning blame to **your company** | Weight in assigning blame to **neighbour** |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Control over the premises** | **High** – you own the building; the Fire Safety Order places the *owner* as the default RP. | **Medium** – the neighbour was a *co‑occupier* with a shared lease; they had control over the equipment they introduced. |\n| **Contractual obligations** | If the lease required the neighbour to PAT‑test and you failed to enforce it, you share blame. | If the lease was silent, the neighbour still owes a duty under EAWR to keep its own equipment safe. |\n| **Knowledge of the risk** | If you knew (or should have known) that unauthorised equipment was being used and did not act, this is a *gross* breach. | If the neighbour was aware the equipment was not PAT‑tested and still used it, they are directly negligent. |\n| **Actions taken before the fire** | • Completed a third‑party FRA (positive). <br>• No specific requirement for PAT testing in the FRA (negative). | • Brought in equipment without PAT testing (clear breach). |\n| **Post‑fire response** | Prompt investigation and corrective actions (mitigating). | N/A (the incident already occurred). |\n| **Regulatory guidance** (CPS “Corporate Manslaughter” policy, HSE “Electrical Safety” guidance) | The CPS will look at *who had the power to prevent the risk*. As owner/RP, you had the power to require PAT testing. | The neighbour had the power to test its own equipment; failure to do so is a direct breach. |\n\n**Resulting conclusion (probable legal view):**\n\n* **Primary criminal liability** is likely to fall on the **neighbouring company** for the *direct* breach of the Electricity at Work Regulations (failure to PAT‑test equipment that caused the short circuit).  \n* **Secondary (or joint) liability** will rest on **your company** as the *Responsible Person* under the Fire Safety Order because you owned the building, you had the statutory duty to ensure that *all* hazards in the out‑building were identified and controlled, and you did not have a robust mechanism (e.g., a contractual clause with enforcement, a joint PAT‑testing schedule, or a specific clause in the FRA) to prevent unauthorised, un‑tested equipment from being used.  \n\nIf the CPS decides the breach by your company was **gross** (e.g., you ignored clear warning signs, failed to amend the FRA after learning of the neighbour’s equipment, or the lease gave you the power to enforce PAT testing but you did not), you could face **Corporate Manslaughter** charges in addition to the Fire Safety Order offence.  \n\nThe neighbour could also face **Corporate Manslaughter** if the court finds that their *sole* act (using an unsafe machine) was the *proximate cause* of death and that the breach was gross. In practice, prosecutors often pursue the *owner/RP* first because the Fire Safety Order carries a maximum fine of **unlimited** and can be used to secure a conviction even where the immediate cause was the neighbour’s equipment.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Practical Recommendations – How to Strengthen Your Position Now\n\n| Immediate Action | How to implement | Expected impact on liability |\n|------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|\n| **1. Issue a formal “Fire‑Safety & Electrical‑Equipment Policy” for the shared out‑building** | • Draft a policy that requires *all* equipment (including that of the neighbour) to be PAT‑tested before entry. <br>• Attach the policy to the lease as a *condition of occupation*. <br>• Set a compliance deadline (e.g., 14 days) and a penalty for breach. | Demonstrates that you are now taking *reasonable* steps to control the risk; may mitigate further liability. |\n| **2. Conduct a *post‑incident* fire‑risk reassessment** | • Engage a different, accredited fire‑risk assessor (e.g., with a Chartered Fire Engineer). <br>• Ensure the new FRA explicitly covers electrical equipment, storage of flammable products, and shared‑use arrangements. | Shows you have corrected the earlier omission; useful for defence that the original FRA was not “suitable and sufficient”. |\n| **3. Arrange an independent PAT‑testing audit** | • Hire a certified electrical contractor to test *all* equipment currently in the out‑", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 328, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 4424}, "latency_s": 16.154193207999924, "request_id": "chatcmpl-0913a3f6-3cd5-4882-98ab-84934478938a", "raw_response": null}
