The candidate answer explicitly addresses this under Section 5 ('Honest but mistaken belief') and Section 4 ('Reasonable force: proportionality and the \\u201cnot to a nicety\\u201d principle'). Specifically, it cites CJIA 2008 s.76(5) stating: 'D is **not** expected to \\u201cweigh to a nicety\\u201d the exact measure of necessary force; evidence D did what he honestly and instinctively thought necessary is strong evidence force was reasonable.' This directly covers the concept of acting instinctively in the heat of the moment based on a belief, even if mistaken, which is the core requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3638b3ae-0c64-4892-b3cc-fc12739096a1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2748, "completion_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 2994}, "latency_s": 0.8819495419738814, "request_id": "sBaVaZzqH_HXvdIPssLX-QQ", "raw_response": null}
