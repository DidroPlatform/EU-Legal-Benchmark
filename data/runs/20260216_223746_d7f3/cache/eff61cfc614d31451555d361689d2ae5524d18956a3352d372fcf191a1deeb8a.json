The candidate answer explicitly cites and relies upon *R v Palmer* [1971] 1 All ER 1077 and *R v Beckford* [1988] AC 130 as binding authority within the English and Welsh legal framework, which is correct for these common law principles. The response does not state that these cases are not binding UK precedent; rather, it uses them as foundational authority for the common law test, which is the correct approach in this jurisdiction. Therefore, the response fails to meet the specific negative requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"bbfa06d0-1d7b-41af-bb76-fa659eee9bd5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4292, "completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 4494}, "latency_s": 0.9704372499836609, "request_id": "dNiUae_jOOesnsEPyseT6QE", "raw_response": null}
