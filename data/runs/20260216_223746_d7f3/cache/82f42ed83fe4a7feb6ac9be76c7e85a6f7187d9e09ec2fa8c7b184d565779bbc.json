The analysis explicitly contrasts claims based on domestic law violations (like environmental statutes) with claims framed as breaches of the BIT's substantive obligations (like FPS or umbrella clauses), which is the core manifestation of the fragmentation problem in this context. Cases like *Saluka*, *Biwater*, *Vattenfall*, and *Urbaser* are cited precisely because they involve tribunals rejecting counterclaims based on domestic environmental law violations, highlighting the tension between investment protection and environmental law regimes.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ef4586ae-f6d1-4db1-8cf9-39379ed2a524\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3273, "completion_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 3467}, "latency_s": 0.989915625017602, "request_id": "Ru6UaZq6BY65kdUPytPImQM", "raw_response": null}
