The candidate answer suggests negotiating a deal where the client provides documents but explicitly *avoids* making admissions of knowledge ('no admissions'). It suggests using a 'Limited-Use Clause' to prevent materials from being used in civil proceedings, and sending a formal counter-offer via letter before action threat. While 'without prejudice' communications are a standard legal tool for settlement negotiations, the response does not explicitly mention or suggest using 'without prejudice' communications specifically for the purpose of making or managing admissions of fact within the context of the negotiation. It focuses on document provision and non-admission clauses.\", \"criterion_id\": \"94086a98-120c-465b-b687-a4fa8f63e165\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2096, "completion_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 2284}, "latency_s": 0.7913290829746984, "request_id": "ESuVac2KMPjHnsEP9ouZ4Qg", "raw_response": null}
