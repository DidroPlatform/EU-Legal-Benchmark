The candidate answer mentions that interest paid by Luxembourg to Ireland would be subject to Section 163(j) (the U.S. rule) and that the limitation applies at the Irish level, but it does not discuss Ireland's domestic implementation of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) interest limitation rules (such as the EBITDA cap or group ratio rule) as required by the criterion. The discussion focuses primarily on U.S. tax implications (TCJA, GILTI, BEAT, Section 163(j)).\", \"criterion_id\": \"2c81e5b4-31f7-4a37-a4c5-9e563d159643\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2003, "completion_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 2207}, "latency_s": 0.7786709169740789, "request_id": "tPKUacq_C62xnsEPvd25uQM", "raw_response": null}
