(ii) CORRECT - Parties can appeal cantonal court decisions to the Federal Court in Switzerland. (iii) INCORRECT - This is a classical Roman law issue about whether possession requires knowledge; the statement is imprecise/misleading as framed. (iv) INCORRECT - Swiss law requires notification within one year, but the contract is not automatically 'deemed ratified' if not notified; rather, the right to contest is lost. (v) INCORRECT - Official information campaign materials (posters, TV-spots) are not administrative decisions subject to direct appeal; they are informational, not decisions affecting legal rights. Statements iii, iv, and v are incorrect.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 559, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 760}, "latency_s": 2.6262962089967914, "request_id": "chatcmpl-54b20a35-0bf5-4bb8-9a79-e44fe3b17a45", "raw_response": null}
