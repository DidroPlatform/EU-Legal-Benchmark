It does not explicitly state the condition required by the criterion: that the LP *can* obtain the treaty benefit *if* the CV avoids a UK PE. While the concepts are linked (a UK PE for the LP would likely mean the CV is not a Dutch resident, thus jeopardizing the treaty benefit), the response fails to make the direct conditional statement required by the rubric criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"41118527-14e6-443d-a588-f584d629adec\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2193, "completion_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 2397}, "latency_s": 0.7528424590127543, "request_id": "OPWUaa39F67pnsEP2M6v6QU", "raw_response": null}
