This clearly indicates that the red lane requires standard EU customs duties and checks for goods moving onward to GB, which is the functional equivalent of goods entering the EU market from NI's perspective in this context.\", \"criterion_id\": \"243ad6d8-553e-4509-b5ff-d646f6b11339\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3938, "completion_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 4146}, "latency_s": 8.255053332948592, "request_id": "UvKUacnmE-LPjrEPqLucuAI", "raw_response": null}
