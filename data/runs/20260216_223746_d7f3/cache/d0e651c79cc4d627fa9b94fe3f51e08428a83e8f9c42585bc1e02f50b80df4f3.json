The candidate answer explicitly addresses the unworkability of the original Protocol by detailing the 'at risk' mechanism (which was the core problem), the need for customs infrastructure (implied by the Red/Green lane system and checks), and the resulting political turmoil (DUP boycott, Stormont Brake creation). Specifically, it mentions the unworkable mechanism to sift goods ('Burden on trader: Must prove goods are NOT at risk to use green lane' and the default presumption of risk) and the political turmoil (DUP boycott over the Irish Sea border and ECJ jurisdiction). This satisfies the requirement for discussing the unworkability based on multiple factors.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2826ef22-06a3-46de-8eb3-18cf74e9e1ed\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2022, "completion_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 2250}, "latency_s": 1.2910431250056718, "request_id": "ktOUaZDSK4qB7M8P4pHemAI", "raw_response": null}
