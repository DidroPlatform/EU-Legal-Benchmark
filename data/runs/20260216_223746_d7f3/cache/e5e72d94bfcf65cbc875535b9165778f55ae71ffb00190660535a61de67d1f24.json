The candidate answer discusses the court's power under s.44 AA 1996, focusing on urgency and the court's supportive role, but it does not explicitly state the condition that permission from the tribunal/emergency arbitrator/parties is required when urgency is absent. Section 44(3) of the Arbitration Act 1996 states that the court shall not exercise its power if the tribunal, or (if the tribunal has not been constituted) an emergency arbitrator, is the appropriate body to grant the relief, unless the court is satisfied that the applicant cannot obtain the relief in time from the tribunal or emergency arbitrator. The candidate answer mentions urgency as a key factor but omits the specific requirement for permission when urgency is not present, which is the core of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f1109ec9-915b-49cf-8602-e1a2f2a99b4b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1677, "completion_tokens": 255, "total_tokens": 1932}, "latency_s": 0.9901722079957835, "request_id": "oxmVaYvhLc_c28oPsY6G4AQ", "raw_response": null}
