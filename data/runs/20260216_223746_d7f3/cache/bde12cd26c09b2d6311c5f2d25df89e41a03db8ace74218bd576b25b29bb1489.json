The 1874 Constitution did grant federal authority over these areas.\n- **CORRECT**\n\n**Statement ii**: \"A contract is void if there is a defect in the conclusion of it.\"\n- This is too broad and incorrect. Not all defects make a contract void. Some defects make it voidable (e.g., error, fraud), while only serious defects (like lack of consent, impossibility, illegality) make it void.\n- **INCORRECT**\n\n**Statement iii**: About criminal law on federal and cantonal levels, with cantons only legislating on contraventions not covered by federal law.\n- This is correct. Swiss criminal law is primarily federal (Swiss Criminal Code), but cantons can legislate on minor contraventions (administrative offenses) not covered by federal law.\n- **CORRECT**\n\n**Statement iv**: About participation in acquired property regime - acquired property comprises assets acquired for valuable consideration during marriage.\n- This is correct under Swiss law (Art. 197 Swiss Civil Code). Acquired property includes what spouses acquire through work, returns on separate property, etc.\n- **CORRECT**\n\n**Statement v**: About Federal Council having a Prime Minister with special powers who can dissolve the Federal Assembly.\n- This is **INCORRECT**. Switzerland has a collegial Federal Council of 7 equal members. There is a rotating President (not Prime Minister) with ceremonial duties only, no special powers, and cannot dissolve the Federal Assembly.\n- **INCORRECT**\n\nIncorrect statements: **ii and v**\n\n{\"answer\": \"F\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement ii is incorrect because not all defects make a contract void (some make it voidable). Statement v is incorrect because Switzerland has no Prime Minister with special powers; the Federal Council consists of 7 equal members with a rotating ceremonial President who cannot dissolve the Federal Assembly.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 580, "completion_tokens": 459, "total_tokens": 1039}, "latency_s": 9.875397583993617, "request_id": "chatcmpl-8874a1ae-4fd7-49fe-ac54-6e70aa464f06", "raw_response": null}
