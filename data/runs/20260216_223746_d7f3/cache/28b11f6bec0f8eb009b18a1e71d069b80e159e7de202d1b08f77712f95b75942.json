The candidate answer correctly identifies the adoption of the original Protocol (which is implied by the context of the Windsor Framework discussion) but incorrectly attributes the date 13/06/2020 to the Windsor Framework's legal instrument (the Amendment 2023), which was adopted in February 2023. The date 13/06/2020 is associated with the original Withdrawal Agreement/Protocol, not the latest revised version as required by the criterion's specific date reference. The candidate mentions the 2023 Amendment adoption date (Feb 27, 2023) but fails to confirm the specific date mentioned in the criterion (13/06/2020) in relation to the *latest revised version* being adopted by the EU on that date. Since the criterion is highly specific about the date 13/06/2020 applying to the latest revised version's adoption by the EU, and the answer focuses on the 2023 changes, it does not satisfy this specific historical date check.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b486b4a5-3f0a-4db2-a5bc-b7d672e69744\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1725, "completion_tokens": 313, "total_tokens": 2038}, "latency_s": 1.9343846659758128, "request_id": "kuKUaeu4EvWT28oP4MbLwA0", "raw_response": null}
