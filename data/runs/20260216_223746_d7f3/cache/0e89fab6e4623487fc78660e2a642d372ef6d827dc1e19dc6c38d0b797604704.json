The candidate answer focuses heavily on the user being a 'squatter' or 'informal licensee' due to lack of rent, concluding they have 'very limited legal protection' and should expect to leave. While it correctly identifies the lack of a formal tenancy, it does not explicitly state the legal principle that *actual occupation* (which the user is claiming via their belongings) must be underpinned by a *right in the land* (like a lease, license, or proprietary interest) to grant protection against a new owner. Instead, it focuses on the negative (no tenancy) and the criminal aspect of squatting, rather than affirming the positive requirement of a legal right for occupation to matter.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8718243c-5ff0-4b5c-8761-fc13dc640746\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1248, "completion_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 1459}, "latency_s": 0.8606706670252606, "request_id": "8CKVafasLPujkdUP0fjD0QU", "raw_response": null}
