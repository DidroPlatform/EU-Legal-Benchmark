Furthermore, in section 2.1, it discusses the chair as an act of nature that does not break the chain, contrasting it with human intervening acts. This directly addresses the core requirement of the criterion: determining liability based on whether the individual's actions (B's swerving) or the external event (the chair) are 'unreasonable' or 'unforeseeable' in the context of breaking the chain of causation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1428e4a3-9748-453e-a85b-e4bc4b2f0440\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3210, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 3420}, "latency_s": 0.7965647079981863, "request_id": "ge-UafXyLv_DnsEPhPSp6QQ", "raw_response": null}
