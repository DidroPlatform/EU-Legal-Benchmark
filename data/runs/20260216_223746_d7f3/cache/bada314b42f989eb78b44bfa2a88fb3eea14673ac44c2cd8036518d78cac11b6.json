Under Section I.C.1, it advises filing for an anti-suit injunction in the English High Court, citing case law (*West Tankers*, *AES Ust-Kamenogorsk*) that confirms English courts (as the seat) have jurisdiction to restrain foreign proceedings that breach the arbitration agreement. Furthermore, Section V. Defend Against Set-Aside Attempts in England confirms that the German distributor may challenge the award in the English courts (seat). This directly satisfies the criterion that the response identifies English courts will have jurisdiction over procedural challenges/setting aside awards.\", \"criterion_id\": \"21254109-d800-4919-9731-27962e600c4f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3866, "completion_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 4047}, "latency_s": 0.8224697500118054, "request_id": "X_-UaYznKfDm7M8PqbvO6QU", "raw_response": null}
