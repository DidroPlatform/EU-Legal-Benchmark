It then details the limitations of the French quotation exception ('courte citation') and warns that reproducing extracts may require permission, especially if the compilation exceeds what counts as a 'short quotation.' This directly satisfies the criterion requiring a warning that a compilation mainly composed of newspaper excerpts typically requires licenses because the quotation exception is ancillary and limited.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b77fbabf-574c-4691-9dc5-f3ba63145858\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1839, "completion_tokens": 152, "total_tokens": 1991}, "latency_s": 0.6687302499776706, "request_id": "UhWVaeXpGvyc28oP7rOrsAU", "raw_response": null}
