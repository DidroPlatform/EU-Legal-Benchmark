The response mentions 'Training and Awareness' (which covers staff training) and 'maintenance of fire safety equipment' (under point 2). Therefore, it lists two of the required elements. However, the prompt asks what the owner would need to demonstrate to an organisation, and the response lists general steps. Specifically, it mentions 'Training and Awareness' (staff fire-safety training) and 'maintenance of fire safety equipment'. Since two required elements are present, the criterion is technically met based on the content provided, even if the context is slightly general.\", \"criterion_id\": \"cbbcb42e-6929-4e60-8717-70dc5a43eb9f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1188, "completion_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 1384}, "latency_s": 0.8980094579746947, "request_id": "YAuVaf-hAuO9kdUPqsTX2Qg", "raw_response": null}
