The candidate answer explicitly discusses the civil liability risk, contrasting the potential tax liability (£10-20M) with the civil judgments (£100M+), and concludes that fighting the tax case is preferable to facing 'certain civil annihilation' based on a confession. This framing, while not explicitly detailing UK compensation law, correctly identifies that the civil judgments (wrongful death lawsuits) represent the greater, potentially existential threat compared to the tax liability, which aligns with the principle that civil damages (especially in negligence/wrongful death cases) are the primary financial danger, often exceeding tax penalties, which is the core concern underlying the criterion's focus on the magnitude of civil liability versus tax liability.\", \"criterion_id\": \"42abff97-5213-4dd4-af7d-f21aac1cdd89\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2053, "completion_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 2268}, "latency_s": 1.4070185830059927, "request_id": "dc-UafrEHY3znsEPmfLf8QQ", "raw_response": null}
