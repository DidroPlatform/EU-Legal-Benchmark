The following is general information based on common principles in jurisdictions like Ireland (where \"slander of title\" is a recognized claim and Euros are used), the UK, or similar common law systems with registered land systems (e.g., Land Registry). Property law is highly fact-specific, jurisdiction-dependent, and turns on details like title registration, dates, notices, and evidence. **You must consult a qualified solicitor immediately**—ideally one specializing in property disputes, family law, and equity—who can review your documents, title deeds, and mortgage details. Time is critical here, as lender actions can escalate quickly (e.g., possession proceedings).\n\n### Short Answer to Your Questions\n- **Does the lender's charge wipe you out, even if you win on constructive trust?** **Likely yes, in most cases.** A bank's legal mortgage (charge) registered on title typically has **priority** over an unregistered or equitable interest like a constructive trust claim. If the property's equity is fully encumbered (e.g., original mortgage + €200k advance > sale value minus your claim), you'd get little/nothing after the bank's secured debt is paid, plus costs.\n- **Can you argue they shouldn't have priority because it was secret/after your investment?** **Possibly, but it's an uphill battle.** Success depends on proving the lender had **actual or constructive notice** of your interest at the time of lending, or other equities (e.g., fraud). Banks are cautious and often protected as \"innocent\" lenders.\n\n### Key Legal Principles (General Overview)\nAssuming a registered title system (common in Ireland/UK/EU):\n\n1. **Your Potential Claim (Constructive Trust)**:\n   - Courts can impose a constructive trust if you prove:\n     - Significant contributions (e.g., €180k renovations increasing value).\n     - Common intention (express/implied) for shared beneficial ownership.\n     - Detrimental reliance (your investment without legal title).\n   - Remedies: Percentage equity share (e.g., 50% or proportional to input), possibly with an order for sale.\n   - **But**: This creates an **equitable** (not legal) interest, which is vulnerable to priorities.\n\n2. **Lender's Mortgage Priority**:\n   - When your ex remortgaged (€200k further advance), the bank got a **legal charge** (mortgage) registered on title.\n   - **Priority rules** (e.g., under Ireland's Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 or UK Land Registration Act 2002 equivalents):\n     | Interest Type | Priority vs. Mortgage |\n     |---------------|-----------------------|\n     | **Registered Legal Mortgage** (bank) | Highest – first in line from registration date. |\n     | **Unregistered Equitable Interest** (your constructive trust) | Loses unless you protected it (e.g., via \"caution\" or \"notice\" on title pre-mortgage). |\n   - **Result**: On sale/foreclosure, bank gets paid **first** from proceeds. If equity = €300k total, bank takes €(original + 200k + interest/fees), leaving scraps for you/ex.\n   - Your solicitor's advice aligns: Bank's charge \"eats the equity.\"\n\n3. **Why the Secrecy/Your Investment Might Not Help (But Could)**:\n   - **No Automatic Override**: Banks lend on the **legal title** holder's representations. If your ex was sole owner and didn't disclose you, the bank is often a **bona fide lender for value without notice** – protected by law.\n   - **Possible Arguments for You** (weak but worth exploring with evidence):\n     | Argument | Chance of Success | What You Need |\n     |----------|-------------------|---------------|\n     | **Constructive Notice** | Medium | Prove bank knew/should've known of your interest (e.g., you lived there openly, renovations visible, bank visited/valued post-your-work, or ex mentioned you). Search title history for your prior cautions. |\n     | **Actual Notice/Fraud** | Low-Medium | Evidence ex lied to bank about sole ownership/value source (e.g., valuation report ignores your €180k input). Challenge mortgage validity if forgery/fraud. |\n     | **Equity/Subrogation** | Low | Argue bank's advance only secures \"new\" value, not your pre-existing equity (rarely works). Or trace your funds into property. |\n     | **Undue Influence/Non-Estoppel** | Low | If relationship was fiduciary, but post-separation secrecy hurts. |\n     | **Priority via Registration** | High if applicable | Did you file a \"lis pendens,\" caution, or notice **before** remortgage? If yes, you might leapfrog. |\n   - **Timing**: Your investment pre-dates loan, but priority is from **registration date**, not creation.\n\n4. **Slander of Title Complication**:\n   - Ex's claim (you \"slandered\" title by disputing ownership) pressures you to drop claims.\n   - Counter: Your claim is legitimate; winning constructive trust defeats it. But lender adds leverage.\n\n### Practical Next Steps (Urgent)\n1. **Hire a Solicitor TODAY**:\n   - Specialist in chancery/equity/property (e.g., via Law Society of Ireland if there).\n   - Costs: Expect €5k-20k+; seek legal aid if eligible.\n   - Get title searches (€50-200), mortgage copies, valuations.\n\n2. **Gather Evidence**:\n   - Renovation receipts (€180k proof), photos, witness statements.\n   - Bank valuation reports (FOI if needed).\n   - Correspondence showing common intention.\n   - Proof of cohabitation/relationship.\n\n3. **Strategic Options**:\n   | Option | Pros | Cons |\n   |--------|------|------|\n   | **Settle with Ex** | Drops slander, avoids bank fight; negotiate buyout. | Lose €180k. |\n   | **Sue for Constructive Trust + Join Bank** | Full claim; possible sale order. | Costly, risky (lose = pay all costs). |\n   | **Negotiate with Bank** | Banks hate disputes; offer to drop claim for partial payout. | Weak position. |\n   | **Bankruptcy/Insolvency on Ex** | Forces sale, but bank still first. | Nuclear, backfires. |\n   | **Injunction** | Stop sale/foreclosure pending trial (if irreparable harm). | Hard to get. |\n\n4. **Timeline Risks**:\n   - Bank can seek possession/order for sale (months).\n   - Slander claim deadlines.\n   - Statute of limitations on trust claims (6 years?).\n\n**Bottom Line**: The bank likely trumps you unless notice or registration saves you. Don't walk away without fighting smartly—your renovations created the value they're exploiting. A solicitor can assess if there's a \"smoking gun\" (e.g., bank's negligence). Act fast; this could go to court quickly. Good luck—update if you get more details (but still, see a pro).", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 355, "completion_tokens": 2034, "total_tokens": 2389}, "latency_s": 15.28708262500004, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJANZB9EGT7RWVE4KXB9QW", "raw_response": null}
