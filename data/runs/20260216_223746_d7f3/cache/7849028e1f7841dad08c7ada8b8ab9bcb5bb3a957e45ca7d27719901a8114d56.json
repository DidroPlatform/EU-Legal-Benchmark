The candidate answer explicitly states in section 6 ('What you can do now (remediation)') that the user should 'Add a privacy notice for future collections (and consider sending it to members now)'. Furthermore, section 2 details exactly what must be included in the information notice (who, purposes, legal basis, recipients, retention, rights), which covers all required elements mentioned in the criterion. Although the suggestion is framed as being for 'future collections' and 'consider sending it to members now' (retroactive), it clearly advises on the necessary content for remediation, satisfying the core requirement of suggesting a retroactive notice with the specified elements.\", \"criterion_id\": \"92fcd868-81a4-46fa-b724-ebb0e227920f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1303, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 1517}, "latency_s": 0.8054944580071606, "request_id": "GxWVaeb4I_fpxN8P0qO4yQw", "raw_response": null}
