The candidate answer discusses the owner's liability extensively, noting that the owner has ultimate responsibility for premises safety and that the neighbor's breach doesn't absolve them. However, the premise of the criterion (that the report *did* mention maintenance) is not addressed. The candidate correctly identifies the owner's liability is significant due to the inadequate assessment and failure to monitor, but it does not specifically address the conditional scenario described in the rubric criterion regarding the report mentioning maintenance and the resulting burden of proof on the owner to show communication/compliance.\", \"criterion_id\": \"182b94af-8003-4587-b1f7-70b8f5270bf1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2884, "completion_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 3096}, "latency_s": 1.142261957982555, "request_id": "Ct2UaaWHEs2Lxs0P7OuNSA", "raw_response": null}
