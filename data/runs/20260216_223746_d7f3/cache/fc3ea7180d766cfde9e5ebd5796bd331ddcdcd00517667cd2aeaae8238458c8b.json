The candidate answer discusses acts requiring court authorization (selling property, accepting inheritance, settling lawsuits) which are generally considered acts of extraordinary administration, not strictly personal acts. It does not list or mention marriage, making a will, or recognizing a child as acts that the administrator either cannot perform or requires specific judicial oversight for, which is the typical context for this type of criterion in guardianship evaluations. Therefore, the required examples of strictly personal acts are missing.\", \"criterion_id\": \"76ad5ae5-f357-4b82-ab68-73459f263a54\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2223, "completion_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 2407}, "latency_s": 0.851525500009302, "request_id": "URaVaazVItusvdIPxq2K-AU", "raw_response": null}
