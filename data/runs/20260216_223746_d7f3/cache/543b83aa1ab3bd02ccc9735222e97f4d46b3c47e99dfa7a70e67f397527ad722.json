{"provider": "nim", "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", "text": " {\"answer\": \"C\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement i is correct: 'methodologically secular' refers to justifying human rights without religious premises. Statement ii is incorrect: under inheritance law principles (including Swiss law), descendants (children) exclude ascendants (parents); the 'parentel' system gives priority to the nearest generation (descendants), not the oldest. Statement iii is incorrect: human rights are justified across various cultural traditions (Islamic, Confucian, African, etc.), not exclusively Western culture. Statement iv is correct: while subjective divergence might negate contract formation in some theories, Swiss contract law (OR Art. 18) follows objective interpretation principles, making this statement accurate. Statement v is incorrect: a legal basis alone does not satisfy proportionality; state action must additionally pass necessity and balancing tests.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 380, "completion_tokens": 2851, "total_tokens": 3231}, "latency_s": 51.36922533300822, "request_id": "chatcmpl-baf8c1009c2b127e", "raw_response": null}
