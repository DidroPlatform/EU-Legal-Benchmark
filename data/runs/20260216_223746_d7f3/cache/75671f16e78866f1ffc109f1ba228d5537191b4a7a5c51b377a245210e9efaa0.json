Furthermore, the section 'The \\\"Two Markets\\\" Reality' states: 'NI must follow EU rules on goods standards (Annex 2 of the Protocol - SPS measures, product standards, VAT on goods, etc.)'. This confirms that goods entering NI, regardless of origin, are subject to EU product standards if they are deemed 'at risk' or if they are subject to Annex 2 rules, which is the general rule for goods in NI under the Protocol/Framework.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e4a1ae1b-a58e-4d31-bec4-4cf261c4a1c4\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1965, "completion_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 2196}, "latency_s": 0.9913960830017459, "request_id": "4tOUafOIF5eBkdUP9--_-AI", "raw_response": null}
