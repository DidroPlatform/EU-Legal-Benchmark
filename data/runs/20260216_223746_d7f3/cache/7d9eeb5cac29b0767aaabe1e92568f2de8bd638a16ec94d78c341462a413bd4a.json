The candidate answer discusses general tenancy rights, eviction procedures, and the status of the occupier (tenant vs. licensee). It mentions ignoring the buyer's message, which is related to disclosure, but it fails to explicitly analyze or apply the specific legal test derived from Schedule 3, paragraph 2(b) of the LRA 2002 regarding 'unreasonable non-disclosure' in the context of overriding interests upon sale of registered land.
