Applicable law and preliminary remarks\n\nDigital Assets Ltd, a société anonyme de droit britannique (assumed equivalent to Swiss *Aktiengesellschaft*, Art. 620 OR), is in liquidation following bankruptcy on 16 November 2017. The liquidator pursues a claim against P&L Audit Ltd for breach of the duty of care in auditing the financial statements for the tax year ending 31 December 2016 (published 30 March 2017). Under Swiss law (governing by exam hypothesis), auditors owe a contractual duty of care to the company under Art. 725 Abs. 1 OR (*Aktiengesellschaften müssen ihre Jahresrechnung und ihren Jahresbericht von einem Revisionsstelle prüfen lassen*), requiring diligent verification of accounts for material misstatements, including willful overvaluations (Art. 727 Abs. 1 OR; BGE 138 III 306 E. 3; BGE 4A_270/2016 E. 3.1). Negligent failure to detect such misstatements engages liability under Art. 97 ff. OR (contract) or Art. 41 OR (tort).\n\nThe liquidator's claim (Art. 228 Abs. 1 Ziff. 1 SchKG; Art. 809 OR) seeks recovery of company losses (e.g., asset dissipation under reelected director Achille Taloon) for creditors and shareholders. No key facts are missing, though quantification of losses and precise negligence proof are assumed.\n\n### II. The *ex turpi causa* defense under Swiss law\n\nThe *ex turpi causa non oritur actio* defense bars claims arising from the claimant's own serious immorality or illegality (Art. 20 Abs. 2 OR; Art. 2 Abs. 1 ZGB; BGE 135 III 457 E. 3.2; BGE 142 III 508 E. 2.1). It applies exceptionally where the plaintiff's turpitude is causally predominant and recovery would offend public policy (*boni mores*), beyond mere contributory negligence (Art. 44 OR; BGE 134 III 478 E. 4.2).\n\nAchille Taloon's willful overvaluation constitutes serious misconduct (violation of Art. 716 Abs. 1 Ziff. 5 OR; potentially Art. 158 StGB), attributable to the company as organ act (Art. 1 Abs. 2 OR). P&L invokes this to impute turpitude to Digital Assets Ltd, arguing the claim derives from the company's own fraud.\n\n### III. Rejection of the defense\n\nP&L Audit Ltd **cannot successfully assert *ex turpi causa*** to defeat the claim, for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Purpose of audit defeats imputation**: The audit mandate (Art. 725 OR) exists precisely to protect the company, shareholders, and creditors from managerial misconduct (BGE 138 III 306 E. 3.2; Forstmoser/Zuberbühler/Meier, *Die Aktiengesellschaft* Art. 725 N. 12). Allowing *ex turpi* would nullify this independent control function (doctrine: G. Volkmar, *in* Staehelin et al., *Basler Kommentar OR/OR-Art. 725* N. 45; BGer 4A_488/2011 E. 3.2 rejecting analogous defense). Taloon's fraud is the very risk auditors must detect through skeptical inquiry (Art. 727 Abs. 1 OR; International Standards on Auditing 240, reflected in Swiss practice).\n\n2. **Dissociation in insolvency**: The liquidator represents the *massa fallimentare* (Art. 228 SchKG), pursuing claims for innocent creditors/shareholders (e.g., Eden Sharehan, 21% owner, misled into reelection on 15 June 2017). Organ fault does not bar estate claims (BGE 4A_354/2011 E. 4.1; BGer 4A_270/2016 E. 3.2; cf. BGE 130 III 764 E. 2.3 on director liability). Creditors' interests prevail over pre-bankruptcy misconduct (Art. 809 Abs. 2 OR).\n\n3. **Causal chain and predominant fault**: The claim arises from *auditors'* negligence enabling reliance (reelection; share drop), not solely Taloon's fraud. Auditors' duty is non-delegable (BGE 138 III 422 E. 4); no collusion alleged (distinguishing BGE 142 III 508). Shareholder reliance (Eden Sharehan) breaks strict imputation (Art. 41 Abs. 1 OR).\n\n4. **Restrictive application**: Swiss courts apply *ex turpi* sparingly against companies (BGE 135 III 457 E. 3.3; BGer 4A_416/2013 E. 2.2), rejecting it where recovery serves third-party protection (creditors/shareholders).\n\nP&L's defense fails; the claim proceeds on merits (negligence proof required).\n\n**Conclusion**: P&L Audit Ltd will not defeat the claim via *ex turpi causa*. Liquidator likely succeeds if negligence established (high probability on facts).", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 525, "completion_tokens": 3551, "total_tokens": 4076}, "latency_s": 34.46554683300201, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJM7BYQ3VDQGBSGQXG05C2", "raw_response": null}
