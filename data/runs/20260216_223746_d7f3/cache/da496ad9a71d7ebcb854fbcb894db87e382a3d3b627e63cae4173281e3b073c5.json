The candidate answer focuses heavily on the drunk driver's liability and the truck driver's emergency response, but it never discusses the time the chair was present or whether the drunk driver had a reasonable opportunity to avoid the chair without swerving. It treats the swerve as a direct reaction to seeing the chair, not analyzing the timing element required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"53430ddb-2da1-464a-af19-ff799ad6064e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1148, "completion_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 1330}, "latency_s": 10.411814042017795, "request_id": "AOGUaa36Dr3ukdUPjeSHsAM", "raw_response": null}
