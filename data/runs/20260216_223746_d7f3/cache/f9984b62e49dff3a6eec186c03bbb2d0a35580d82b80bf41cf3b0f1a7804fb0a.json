The candidate answer discusses Section 163(j) (earnings stripping), BEAT, Subpart F, GILTI, PFIC rules, and CAMT, but it does not mention or discuss Section 267A or any specific mitigation strategies related to it (like check-the-box elections or consistent classification of the debt/equity for U.S. and foreign tax purposes to avoid hybrid treatment).
