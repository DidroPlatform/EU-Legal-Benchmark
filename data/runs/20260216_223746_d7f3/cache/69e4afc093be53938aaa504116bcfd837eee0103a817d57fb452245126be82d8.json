In practice, **its staff can be governed either by public law or private law**, depending on:\n- **the constitutive agreement / statutes of the GIP** (convention constitutive), and\n- **the legislative/regulatory regime applicable to that particular category of GIP** (since GIPs can be created under different legal bases).\n\nMany GIPs operate with **private-law employment contracts** (often aligned with the Labour Code), while sometimes also hosting seconded public servants or recruiting agents under public-law contracts.\n\n### 2) Public service activity does not automatically require public-law status\nThe fact that the agent contributes to a **service public** does **not** automatically mean they must be a public-law agent. In France, **public services can be operated with private-law employees**, including within public bodies, **as long as**:\n- the job does **not** involve exercising **prérogatives de puissance publique (PPP)** (e.g., coercive powers, sanctions, regulatory decisions, police powers), or\n- if such powers exist, they are strictly framed and exercised by duly authorized public agents (or under the specific arrangements the law permits).\n\nIn other words: **doing “public service work” ≠ being a public-law agent**, but **exercising sovereign authority functions** generally requires a different setup.\n\n### 3) Key conditions/checkpoints before recruiting under private law\nTo secure the choice of a private-law contract, you should verify:\n\n1. **What your “convention constitutive” says**  \n   Many GIP statutes specify the applicable staff regime (public/private/mixed), recruitment procedures, and which body is competent to hire.\n\n2. **Whether your GIP is an “EPA-like” GIP or closer to an “EPIC-like” model**  \n   Some GIPs are treated more like administrative public bodies (often more public-law staffing), others more like industrial/commercial bodies (often mostly private-law staffing). This affects litigation jurisdiction too (administrative vs judicial courts).\n\n3. **Whether the position entails PPP or core sovereign decisions**  \n   If the role includes signing administrative decisions, imposing sanctions, issuing authorizations, or similar powers, you should **avoid assigning those acts** to a private-law employee (or redesign the delegation/chain of signature so those decisions are taken by authorized public agents).\n\n4. **Collective framework**  \n   If you employ private-law staff, you must apply the relevant **Labour Code rules**, including social dialogue institutions, working time rules, disciplinary procedures, termination rules, and potentially a **collective bargaining agreement (CCN)** if applicable.\n\n### 4) Practical answer\n- **Yes**, you can recruit under **private law** even for public service missions.\n- **But** ensure the agent’s duties **do not involve PPP**, and that your **founding agreement/statutes** and applicable texts **permit private-law recruitment**.\n\nIf you share (i) the legal basis of your GIP (e.g., sector: health, research, etc.), (ii) what your convention constitutive says about staff, and (iii) the agent’s intended duties (especially any signature/delegation), I can help you assess the risk points and how to structure the role/decision-making safely.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 52, "completion_tokens": 771, "total_tokens": 823}, "latency_s": 20.633319832995767, "request_id": "gen_01KHNHYTYX1MCGK0W5H2V25STG", "raw_response": null}
