The candidate answer discusses taxes in section 15, mentioning 'GST/HST/PST' and clarifying that the distributor usually handles sales taxes, and also mentions 'Withholding taxes' in relation to services/royalties. However, it does not explicitly state that 'tax payment terms and conditions' must be included in the contract as a specific contractual term to look out for, focusing more on who is responsible for sales tax collection rather than the contractual terms governing tax payments between the UK manufacturer and the Canadian distributor.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b46b7cfb-5908-49f9-9de8-8741d5f6ff20\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2446, "completion_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 2620}, "latency_s": 0.7574212499894202, "request_id": "fxWVacbeH4bIvdIPqfe6oAk", "raw_response": null}
