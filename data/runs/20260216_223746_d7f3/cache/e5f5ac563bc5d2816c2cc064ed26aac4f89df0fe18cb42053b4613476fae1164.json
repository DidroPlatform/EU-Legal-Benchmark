The candidate answer explicitly mentions the UK section under Procedural Risks: 'High discovery burden (CPR 31)'. CPR Part 31 governs disclosure (discovery) in the UK, and the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) generally mandate proportionality in disclosure obligations (e.g., CPR 31.5(2) and the overriding objective in CPR 1.1). While the candidate does not use the exact word 'proportional', referencing 'CPR 31' in the context of UK litigation discovery satisfies the requirement to identify the relevant rules governing discovery in that jurisdiction.\", \"criterion_id\": \"92b58255-0bf8-4690-99a4-55e9abe78dd9\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2582, "completion_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 2769}, "latency_s": 0.7654555420158431, "request_id": "7iWVacSIMMeC7M8P_tvRkAs", "raw_response": null}
