The candidate answer states under Element 2: 'The interference must be more than trivial and not justified by the neighbour\\u2019s rights. Reasonableness is judged by the nature of the locality, the time of day, the frequency and volume, and the character of the claimant\\u2019s use of the land.' While it doesn't use the exact phrasing 'reasonable person would tolerate,' it clearly establishes that the test for unreasonableness involves balancing the interference against the rights and expectations of the locality and the claimant, which is the essence of the 'reasonable person' test in nuisance law (often referred to as the 'give and take' principle or judged by the 'ordinary person of the locality'). Furthermore, section 2 discusses how unreasonableness is measured in the context of the residential area, which directly addresses the 'similar circumstances' aspect of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"917b097d-1675-48db-b174-5360c3fe9aa1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3418, "completion_tokens": 259, "total_tokens": 3677}, "latency_s": 1.0496566250221804, "request_id": "duuUaaf6BOesnsEPyseT6QE", "raw_response": null}
