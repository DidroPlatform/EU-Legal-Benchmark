While this is an exit mechanism after a period, it is a mandatory repurchase right (a 'Put'), not a 'Sale Process Covenant Drag' (which typically forces the majority/founders to initiate a sale process after a set time if an exit hasn't occurred, often linked to GmbHG \\u00a730 requirements for minority exit rights in certain contexts).
