The candidate answer focuses heavily on the liability of the drunk driver, stating their swerve was the cause, and discusses the truck driver's response as a reasonable emergency response. It does not explicitly raise the counter-argument that the drunk driver's swerve was an intervening act that broke the chain of causation *because* a sober, reasonable driver would have reacted differently (e.g., stopped or merged safely) rather than swerving into another car. The analysis focuses on the drunk driver's intoxication making their action culpable, not on whether a reasonable, sober reaction would have avoided the collision, which is the core of the required argument.\", \"criterion_id\": \"59f0e49d-855e-44f4-bd5f-6e656891aa30\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1149, "completion_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 1385}, "latency_s": 1.3126064160023816, "request_id": "yuCUafuqDrPUvdIP-OL2kQE", "raw_response": null}
