This implies that without a successful parody defense, it is an infringement, likely as a derivative work. While it doesn't explicitly use the term 'right of integrity violation,' the discussion of parody/pastiche in the EU context inherently touches upon moral rights, and classifying the unauthorized commercial use of a warped version as infringement covers the core requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"7fa2efd8-305b-4b3e-b8d7-eddaaba059cd\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2463, "completion_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 2728}, "latency_s": 1.242188874981366, "request_id": "pyGVaeqDC_fnnsEPornoiAk", "raw_response": null}
