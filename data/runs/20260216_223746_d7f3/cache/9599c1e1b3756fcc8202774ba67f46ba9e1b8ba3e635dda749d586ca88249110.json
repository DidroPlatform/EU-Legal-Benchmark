Let me explain what you'd need to prove.\n\n## Elements of Private Nuisance\n\nTo succeed in a private nuisance claim, you must establish:\n\n### 1. **Substantial and Unreasonable Interference**\n- The interference must be more than trivial or minor\n- Loud rock music until 2am twice weekly would likely qualify as substantial\n- The test is whether it materially affects the **ordinary comfort** of human existence according to **plain and sober standards** (*Walter v Selfe*)\n\n### 2. **With Your Use and Enjoyment of Land**\n- You must have a legal interest in the property (ownership satisfies this)\n- The interference must affect your ability to use/enjoy your property\n\n### 3. **Unreasonableness Assessment**\n\nCourts consider several factors:\n\n**Locality** (*Sturges v Bridgman*)\n- \"What would be a nuisance in Belgrave Square would not necessarily be so in Bermondsey\"\n- South Kensington is a residential area, so noise tolerance is lower\n- However, your expectations alone don't determine the standard\n\n**Duration and Frequency**\n- Regular occurrences (twice weekly) strengthen your case\n- Late hours (until 2am) are particularly significant\n\n**Severity of Harm**\n- Actual sleep disturbance or health impacts help your case\n\n**Malice** (less relevant here)\n- Deliberate annoyance strengthens claims (*Christie v Davey*)\n\n## Important Limitations\n\n**\"Coming to the Nuisance\" is NOT a defence** (*Sturges v Bridgman*, *Coventry v Lawrence*)\n- The fact that you moved there after the band started doesn't defeat your claim\n- However, it may be relevant to the character of the neighbourhood\n\n## Remedies Available\n\n- **Injunction** - to stop or restrict the music\n- **Damages** - compensation for loss of enjoyment\n\n## Practical Recommendations\n\nBefore litigation:\n1. Keep a detailed log (dates, times, noise levels)\n2. Gather evidence (recordings, other neighbours' statements)\n3. Consider the local authority's environmental health department for statutory noise nuisance\n4. Attempt negotiation with your neighbour first\n\nWould you like guidance on any specific aspect of bringing this claim?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 92, "completion_tokens": 546, "total_tokens": 638}, "latency_s": 11.212099875003332, "request_id": "chatcmpl-fcc497ee-665c-48dd-ad6e-c2185ff1ffcd", "raw_response": null}
