The candidate answer discusses the German distributor's potential counterclaims, including reputation damage, and suggests shifting the burden to them to prove actual defects, but it does not explicitly state that the German distributor will likely fail to prove damages due to a high burden of proof threshold in the context of the breach of contract claim (which is the primary claim initiated by the German firm). The analysis focuses more on jurisdiction and strategy rather than the specific evidentiary hurdle for the German firm's damages claim.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d00808cb-d679-4896-825b-ae9319778964\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3872, "completion_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 4052}, "latency_s": 1.9767302919644862, "request_id": "9P-UafG0FvT77M8Prpvt6Ag", "raw_response": null}
