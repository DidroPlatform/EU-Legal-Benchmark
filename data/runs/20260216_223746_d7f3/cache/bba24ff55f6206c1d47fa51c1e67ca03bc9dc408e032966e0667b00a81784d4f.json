The candidate answer discusses Adverse Possession and 'Tolerated Trespasser' status, which relate to rights in the land, but it does not explicitly state the fundamental legal principle that actual occupation alone is insufficient without a recognized legal right (like a lease, license, or proprietary interest) to establish protection against a new owner, especially in the context of overriding interests under land law, which is what the question implicitly touches upon. The answer focuses on establishing a right through adverse possession or tolerated trespasser status rather than highlighting the necessity of having a pre-existing right in the land for occupation to confer protection.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8718243c-5ff0-4b5c-8761-fc13dc640746\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1354, "completion_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 1547}, "latency_s": 1.7805339159676805, "request_id": "1AOVaarDNfrhnsEP9oTP2Qk", "raw_response": null}
