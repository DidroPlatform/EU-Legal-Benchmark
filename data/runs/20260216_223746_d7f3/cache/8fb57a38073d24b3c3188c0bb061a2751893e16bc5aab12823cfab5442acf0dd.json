The response mentions the UK Trade Mark and confirms infringement if the mark is 'confusingly similar' (Section 1). In Section 4.1, it cites the legal basis as 'Trade Marks Act 1994 s.10(1) \\u2013 infringement'. Section 10(1) covers direct infringement (identical mark/identical goods), while Section 10(2) covers infringement where the mark is similar and there is a likelihood of confusion. Since the user states the competitor has a 'nearly identical name' and the context strongly implies a likelihood of confusion (which is the standard test for similar marks), advising reliance on s.10(2) would be more precise and appropriate than s.10(1) alone, especially given the explicit requirement of the rubric. The response mentions s.10 generally but specifies s.10(1) in the C&D letter template, failing to explicitly prioritize s.10(2) as required.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2c1262d5-0b0b-4fee-a3bb-93d8a8541b92\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4532, "completion_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 4835}, "latency_s": 1.3157315830467269, "request_id": "j-iUab3UFLPUvdIPx-X2oQE", "raw_response": null}
