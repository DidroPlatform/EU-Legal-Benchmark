It discusses the applicant's role as the 'Responsible Person' (Article 9/8) and specifically highlights the need to demonstrate coordination arrangements under shared occupancy, which directly relates to Article 22 of the FSO 2005. While it doesn't quote Article 5(3) directly, the entire section on 'Shared Occupancy Management' and the conclusion about shared liability clearly demonstrates an understanding that liability depends on the extent of control and cooperation between dutyholders as governed by these articles.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5a7e0773-5baa-4db9-ad30-8b52ad1d1305\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2516, "completion_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 2695}, "latency_s": 0.7952213340031449, "request_id": "2c2UaazPItjpnsEPmcvxyAE", "raw_response": null}
