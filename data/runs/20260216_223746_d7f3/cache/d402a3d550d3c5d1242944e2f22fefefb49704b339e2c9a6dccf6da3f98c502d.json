The candidate answer correctly describes the Protocol's position: \\\"Pre-WF (Protocol Art. 4), all GB-NI goods presumed at risk (burden on traders to prove not).\\\" However, the criterion specifically asks about the *Protocol* presumption, and the candidate answer immediately pivots to explaining the *Windsor Framework* presumption (\\\"Default Presumption: Goods from GB to NI are NOT at risk\\\"). While the historical context is present, the direct, unambiguous statement confirming the Protocol's 'at risk' presumption as the primary answer to the burden of proof question is slightly obscured by the immediate contrast with the WF. Given the strict nature of rubric evaluation, the answer must clearly and directly address the state *under the Protocol* as specified by the criterion, which it does, but it frames it as a contrast rather than a direct answer to the implied question about the Protocol's rule.\", \"criterion_id\": \"61afe06c-4c7c-460c-8a2e-3ba3157cf84e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2708, "completion_tokens": 272, "total_tokens": 2980}, "latency_s": 1.50746558298124, "request_id": "4zOVaevmDqSDkdUP5IaYkQM", "raw_response": null}
