It states that unauthorized T-shirts, including 'warped mockery,' likely constitute infringement because they exploit the character's recognition for commercial gain. It also mentions that exceptions like parody are narrow, implying that the mocking version would likely be considered an infringing derivative work unless it meets very strict criteria, which aligns with the expectation that it would be considered a copyright violation as a derivative work (and potentially a right of integrity violation, as the text mentions moral rights implicitly through the discussion of Italian law and infringement).\", \"criterion_id\": \"7fa2efd8-305b-4b3e-b8d7-eddaaba059cd\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1650, "completion_tokens": 170, "total_tokens": 1820}, "latency_s": 0.826576457999181, "request_id": "IjWVac-tJYzYxs0P5_PJ2Qo", "raw_response": null}
