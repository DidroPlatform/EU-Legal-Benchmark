The candidate answer explicitly recommends the UK entity become a 'limited-risk service provider' remunerated on a 'routine cost-plus' basis. While this describes a cost-plus entity, it does not explicitly state or claim that this routine cost-plus entity can claim Patent Box relief on its service fee. In fact, Patent Box relief is typically claimed on profits derived from qualifying IP, which, under the recommended structure, would primarily reside with the Irish Principal, not the routine UK service provider.\", \"criterion_id\": \"728c5765-a2bb-459e-b2f7-57c1deebd2ac\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1507, "completion_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 1687}, "latency_s": 1.0290973339579068, "request_id": "sByVafTKO62WkdUPiJ3nmQk", "raw_response": null}
