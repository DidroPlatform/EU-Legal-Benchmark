Here's the operationally sound path:\n\n## 1. IMMEDIATE: Refrigerant Classification Reality Check\n\n**Before any structural decision**, confirm with your freight forwarder:\n\n- **Lyon (R290)**: Classified as what? (likely 8418.30 or 8418.99)\n- **Alpine (R454B)**: Classified as what? (likely same HS code, different environmental/safety attributes)\n\n**Critical distinction**: Different refrigerants ≠ automatically different HS codes or origin treatment. R454B is a *lower GWP alternative* to R410A, not a fundamentally different product category.\n\n**Action**: Request written classification ruling from HMRC or use a customs broker's pre-clearance service (UK Customs Advance Ruling). If both are 8418.30, you have **one origin claim**, not two.\n\n---\n\n## 2. STRUCTURAL SOLUTION: UK-Based IOR Without Direct French Liability\n\nYou need a **lightweight UK entity** that acts as IOR but doesn't expose your French parent to direct HMRC liability. This is the standard multinational workaround:\n\n### Option A: Dormant UK Subsidiary (Fastest)\n- Establish a **UK private limited company** (48 hours via Companies House)\n- Minimal staffing: director + compliance officer (can be outsourced)\n- **Role**: Sole importer of record for HMRC purposes\n- **Liability shield**: Separate legal entity; French parent is supplier, not declarant\n\n**Structure:**\n```\nFrench Parent (Manufacturer/Exporter)\n    ↓ (Sells on Ex Works)\nUK Subsidiary Ltd (IOR/VAT Declarant)\n    ↓ (Imports under own EORI)\nUK Retailer (now US-owned)\n```\n\n**Why this works:**\n- UK Subsidiary has its own EORI number\n- Subsidiary files VAT returns independently\n- French parent has no direct HMRC exposure\n- Subsidiary can be insured for customs liability\n- Subsidiary can negotiate payment terms with retailer separately\n\n**Cost**: ~£500-1,500 setup + £1,200-2,000/year compliance\n\n---\n\n### Option B: Freight Forwarder as IOR (Riskier but Faster)\n\nSome freight forwarders will act as IOR under a **Principal-Agent agreement**:\n\n**Pros:**\n- No new UK entity needed\n- Forwarder assumes customs liability\n- Faster implementation\n\n**Cons:**\n- Forwarder may refuse if they sense regulatory risk\n- VAT liability still falls on you (the importer of record)\n- Less control over customs declarations\n- Forwarder's insurance may not cover your exposure\n\n**Only viable if**: Forwarder agrees in writing to indemnify you for customs rejections related to origin claims.\n\n---\n\n## 3. HANDLING THE MIXED CONSIGNMENT: Single vs. Split Entry\n\n### The Real Question: Do You Actually Need Two Entries?\n\n**Split entry scenario** (two customs declarations):\n- Cost: ~£400-600 additional brokerage fees\n- Timeline: Adds 2-3 days\n- Benefit: Isolates each model's origin claim\n\n**Single entry scenario** (one customs declaration):\n- Cost: Standard brokerage (~£150-250)\n- Timeline: Normal clearance\n- Risk: If origin challenged, entire shipment held\n\n**The deciding factor**: Your origin substantiation strength.\n\n---\n\n## 4. ORIGIN SUBSTANTIATION: Unified Claim Strategy\n\n**Both models can share ONE origin claim if:**\n\n1. **Both manufactured in France** (same facility or certified suppliers)\n2. **Both meet Rules of Origin** (RoO) under UK-EU TCA\n\n### What You Need (Prepare NOW):\n\n**For HMRC pre-clearance or customs broker:**\n\n```\nORIGIN DECLARATION PACKAGE:\n\nLyon Model (R290):\n├─ Bill of Materials (BoM) showing % EU content\n├─ Supplier invoices (EU-sourced components)\n├─ Manufacturing process documentation\n└─ Refrigerant sourcing (R290 origin)\n\nAlpine Model (R454B):\n├─ Bill of Materials (BoM) showing % EU content\n├─ Supplier invoices (EU-sourced components)\n├─ Manufacturing process documentation\n└─ Refrigerant sourcing (R454B origin - likely EU-produced)\n\nUNIFIED CLAIM:\n├─ Statement: \"Both models manufactured in France, \n│   meet UK-EU TCA RoO, eligible for preferential treatment\"\n├─ Comparative BoM analysis (if % content differs, explain why)\n└─ Certification of origin (Form EUR.1 or statement)\n```\n\n**Critical**: R454B is increasingly EU-produced (Chemours, Honeywell have EU plants). If your Alpine uses EU-sourced R454B, origin is **identical** to Lyon.\n\n---\n\n## 5. VAT EXPOSURE: Structural Mitigation\n\n**Current problem**: Ex Works = you're the importer; you owe UK VAT on full value.\n\n**Mitigation structure:**\n\n```\nOPTION 1: UK Subsidiary Handles VAT\n├─ Subsidiary imports under own EORI\n├─ Subsidiary charges VAT to retailer (on invoice)\n├─ Subsidiary files VAT return (quarterly)\n├─ Subsidiary recovers input VAT on freight/duties\n└─ French parent invoices subsidiary (Ex Works)\n\nOPTION 2: Retailer Absorbs VAT (Contractual)\n├─ Amend supply contract: \"Retailer responsible for VAT\"\n├─ You invoice Ex Works (no VAT)\n├─ Retailer imports under their EORI\n└─ Retailer files VAT return\n```\n\n**Reality check**: Option 2 is what the US conglomerate *should* do, but their legal team is refusing. So Option 1 (UK Subsidiary) is your only structural protection.\n\n---\n\n## 6. CUSTOMS REJECTION RISK: Insurance & Contingency\n\n**If origin is challenged:**\n\n- Entire container held at port (cost: ~£50-100/day demurrage)\n- Retailer's supply chain disrupted (their problem, but damages your relationship)\n- HMRC may demand re-export or duty payment\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\n1. **Customs Indemnity Insurance**: UK Subsidiary obtains policy (~£300-500/year)\n   - Covers duties + penalties if origin claim rejected\n   - Requires proof of due diligence (your BoM documentation)\n\n2. **Pre-Clearance Ruling**: Before shipment, request HMRC Customs Advance Ruling\n   - Cost: ~£200-400\n   - Timeline: 30 days\n   - Benefit: Binding decision; eliminates rejection risk\n\n3. **Freight Forwarder Guarantee**: Require written guarantee that forwarder will re-export at their cost if origin rejected\n\n---\n\n## 7. OPERATIONAL TIMELINE: Fast-Track Implementation\n\n**Week 1:**\n- [ ] Confirm refrigerant classification with HMRC or broker (2 days)\n- [ ] Establish UK Subsidiary (2 days)\n- [ ] Obtain UK EORI for subsidiary (1 day)\n- [ ] Prepare origin substantiation package (2 days)\n\n**Week 2:**\n- [ ] Submit HMRC Customs Advance Ruling (if needed)\n- [ ] Finalize contract amendment with retailer (Ex Works terms)\n- [ ] Arrange customs indemnity insurance for subsidiary\n\n**Week 3:**\n- [ ] Ship container (single customs entry, unified origin claim)\n- [ ] File VAT return through UK Subsidiary\n\n---\n\n## 8. THE HARD CONVERSATION: What to Tell the Retailer\n\n**Their legal team is wrong about one thing**: They can't simply refuse to be IOR and shift all liability to you without a contractual mechanism. But they have leverage (they're your customer).\n\n**Proposed amendment to supply contract:**\n\n> \"Goods supplied Ex Works, French origin. Buyer (Retailer) shall:\n> 1. Arrange and pay for all freight and insurance\n> 2. Become importer of record with HMRC\n> 3. File all customs declarations\n> 4. Bear all customs duties and VAT\n> \n> If Buyer refuses IOR role, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all costs of third-party IOR arrangement, including UK entity setup, VAT, and customs compliance.\"\n\n**If they refuse this**, you have leverage: \"Then we need to discuss price adjustment for the additional £2,000-3,000 in compliance costs per shipment.\"\n\n---\n\n## 9. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Integrated Approach\n\n**Do this:**\n\n1. **Establish UK Subsidiary immediately** (Option A above)\n   - This is your structural insurance policy\n   - Costs ~£1,500 one-time; protects French parent\n\n2. **Request HMRC Customs Advance Ruling** on origin (both models, single claim)\n   - Eliminates rejection risk\n   - Takes 30 days but worth it for ongoing orders\n\n3. **Ship as single consignment** with unified origin declaration\n   - Saves £400-600 in brokerage fees\n   - Faster clearance (3-5 days vs. 5-7 days for split entry)\n\n4. **UK Subsidiary files VAT return** quarterly\n   - Subsidiary recovers input VAT on freight/duties\n   - Retailer pays VAT on invoice from subsidiary\n\n5. **Obtain customs indemnity insurance** for subsidiary\n   - Covers tail risk if origin challenged despite ruling\n\n**Total additional cost**: ~£3,500 one-time + £1,200/year + ~£300/year insurance\n\n**Benefit**: French parent completely insulated from HMRC liability; you control the customs narrative; you can handle future mixed shipments without renegotiating.\n\n---\n\n## One More Thing: The Refrigerant Wildcard\n\n**Confirm this with your forwarder**: Is the concern that R454B triggers **environmental compliance** (F-gas regulation) rather than customs classification?\n\nIf so, that's a **separate issue** from origin:\n- R454B requires EU F-gas compliance documentation\n- This doesn't change HS code or origin claim\n- But it does require additional paperwork (safety data sheet, etc.)\n\nIf that's the real concern, it's actually **easier** to solve than origin—just add the F-gas documentation to your customs package.\n\nWhat's your forwarder's specific concern about R454B classification?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 256, "completion_tokens": 2523, "total_tokens": 2779}, "latency_s": 24.378242375008995, "request_id": "chatcmpl-fe287b24-5fbe-4110-a3a6-29972c87bc09", "raw_response": null}
