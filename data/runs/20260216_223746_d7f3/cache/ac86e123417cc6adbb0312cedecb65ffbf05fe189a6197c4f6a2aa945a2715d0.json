The candidate answer addresses the injunction in Section II under the supplier's potential argument that proceeding despite the injunction violated due process and exceeded powers. It then rebuts this by stating that a procedural irregularity (ignoring an injunction) does not rise to the level of public policy violation. However, the criterion asks if the response *mentions* that the injunction *may work against* recognition based on public policy. While the response discusses the public policy defense (Section II, 'The award conflicts with US public policy'), it frames it as a weak argument the opponent might raise, which the candidate then rebuts. It does not explicitly state that the *existence* of the injunction itself could be used as a public policy violation argument against recognition, only that the *tribunal's action* in ignoring it is unlikely to meet the public policy threshold. Since the core of the defense strategy is to *rebut* the public policy argument related to the injunction, rather than explicitly stating the injunction itself forms the basis of a public policy challenge that must be overcome, it does not directly satisfy the prompt's focus on mentioning the injunction *working against* recognition on public policy grounds, even if it discusses the public policy defense generally.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f101b285-a1a0-4537-859b-11fe9252516e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3400, "completion_tokens": 332, "total_tokens": 3732}, "latency_s": 1.315079833031632, "request_id": "pPqUafHbKY65kdUPy9PImQM", "raw_response": null}
