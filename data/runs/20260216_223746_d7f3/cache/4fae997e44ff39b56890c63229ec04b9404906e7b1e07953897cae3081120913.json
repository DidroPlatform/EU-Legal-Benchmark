Control Point 1.2, 'Documentation & Contemporaneous Records,' explicitly mandates the maintenance of contemporaneous documentation for tax transactions and includes KPIs related to documentation completeness and quality. Furthermore, Control Point 1.1, 'Data Retention & Lifecycle Management,' establishes automated data classification and retention policy enforcement for tax-relevant data, which inherently covers the requirement for defined retention periods necessary for defense, even if it doesn't explicitly state '3 years post-acquisition.' The framework clearly integrates the need for contemporaneous documentation as a core control.\", \"criterion_id\": \"741b2c1b-48eb-428c-8fa9-3a4814573571\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4124, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 4325}, "latency_s": 0.9220182920107618, "request_id": "MuKUaYSmEIy0vdIP55ysuQ4", "raw_response": null}
