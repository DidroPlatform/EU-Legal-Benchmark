In England, your protection is very different depending on whether you are a **tenant**, a **lodger/licensee**, or (less commonly) someone with no right to occupy.\n\nBased on what you’ve said (10 years in a room, not paying rent, in a shared flat), the key issues are: **(1) do you live with the landlord? (2) do you have exclusive possession of your room? (3) is there any written agreement / evidence of rent or other consideration? (4) have you actually moved out or only been temporarily away?**\n\n## 1) The buyer cannot just “tell you to leave” and change the locks (in most cases)\nIf you have **any tenancy** (including an implied one), you generally have protection from unlawful eviction. Normally, the new owner must:\n- give proper notice (often a **Section 21** or **Section 8** process if it’s an assured shorthold tenancy), and\n- get a **court order** and (if needed) bailiffs.\n\nIf they lock you out without a court process and you are a residential occupier, that can be an **unlawful eviction** (a criminal offence under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977) and you may be able to get urgent help from the council/housing solicitor.\n\n## 2) But if you were a lodger/licensee, protection is much weaker\nIf the **landlord lived in the flat as their only/main home** and you occupied a room there, you are likely an **excluded occupier (lodger)**. In that case the landlord (and sometimes a successor owner, depending on the facts) can usually end the arrangement with **“reasonable notice”** and doesn’t need a court order.\n\nHowever, many 4‑bed “flatshare” situations are **not** live-in landlord arrangements, and if the landlord did not live there, you’re more likely to be a **tenant**.\n\n## 3) “Not paying rent” does not automatically mean you have no rights\n- If you genuinely paid **nothing** and there was no “consideration” (e.g., you weren’t providing services in lieu of rent), the occupier status can get murky.\n- But long occupation with the owner’s permission can still create a **licence** (and sometimes a tenancy can be implied depending on the arrangement).\n- Also, even a licensee who is a “residential occupier” may still require a proper legal process to evict **unless** they are excluded (e.g., a lodger).\n\n## 4) Your temporary absence abroad does not necessarily end your rights\nGoing abroad for a few months does not automatically mean you have surrendered the room—especially if:\n- your belongings are still there,\n- you intend to return,\n- you kept keys / access,\n- you didn’t give notice or agree to end your occupation.\n\nThat said, if the owner can show you **gave up possession** (surrender/abandonment), that weakens your position. Ignoring the buyer’s text isn’t, by itself, proof you surrendered.\n\n## 5) Sale of the property doesn’t automatically end occupiers’ rights\nIf you had a tenancy, the buyer usually buys the property **subject to existing occupiers’ rights** (they step into the old landlord’s shoes). If you were merely a personal licence, it may or may not bind a purchaser—this becomes fact-specific and you should get advice fast.\n\n## What to do now (practical steps)\n1. **Do not leave voluntarily** or sign anything until you’ve had advice, if you want to keep your position.\n2. **Write to the new owner immediately**:\n   - state you are an occupier,\n   - you have not surrendered/abandoned,\n   - you do not consent to eviction without due process,\n   - ask what legal basis they claim and what notice they are relying on.\n3. **Collect evidence**: any texts/emails with the old landlord, any proof you lived there (post, bank statements, GP registration, council tax letters, electoral roll), keys, photos of your room/belongings, witness statements from flatmates/neighbours.\n4. **Get urgent advice**:\n   - **Shelter** (housing charity) has an excellent helpline and online tools.\n   - Your **local council’s Tenancy Relations Officer (TRO)** can intervene if there’s harassment/illegal eviction risk.\n   - A **housing solicitor** (legal aid may be available for eviction/unlawful eviction issues depending on circumstances).\n\n## Key questions that determine your protection\nReply with:\n1) Did the landlord **live in the flat** as their main home at any point during your occupation (especially recently)?  \n2) Did you have **your own lockable room** and could the landlord enter freely or only with permission?  \n3) Did you ever pay rent or contribute to bills, or provide work/services in exchange?  \n4) Do you have any written agreement, even informal messages?  \n5) Are other people currently living there, and who holds the tenancy/lease with the landlord?\n\nWith those facts, I can tell you the most likely status (tenant vs lodger/licensee) and what eviction process would be required in London.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 151, "completion_tokens": 1106, "total_tokens": 1257}, "latency_s": 17.660204042011173, "request_id": "gen_01KHNHZ9PEZX029GRYJN2YCYPQ", "raw_response": null}
