The criterion requires the response to identify Article II of the New York Convention (duty to recognize arbitration agreements) as relevant to resisting judicial interference. The candidate answer focuses almost entirely on Article V defenses (jurisdiction, due process, waiver) and general deference principles, but it fails to explicitly mention or discuss Article II's role in compelling arbitration or resisting judicial interference *prior* to the enforcement stage, which is what the criterion targets. While Article II is foundational, the answer does not identify it as a relevant argument for the *enforcement defense strategy* described in the prompt, which is focused on resisting the US supplier's Article V challenge.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8ff30d78-acbb-408c-9669-f016cc43474e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1561, "completion_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 1773}, "latency_s": 1.440853292006068, "request_id": "39uUacriG7n2vdIP0t_ZqAM", "raw_response": null}
