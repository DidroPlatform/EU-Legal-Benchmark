The ground truth is that a registered charge almost always has priority unless the interest is overriding or the charge is set aside. The candidate answer correctly states the general rule: \\\"a registered mortgage/charge typically takes priority over unregistered beneficial interests (like your constructive trust claim) unless... the bank had actual notice... or the bank is deemed to have constructive notice.\\\" It explicitly warns that if the bank had no notice, the charge will likely rank ahead. It does not incorrectly advise that the constructive trust automatically has priority; in fact, it correctly outlines the conditions under which the registered charge prevails, which aligns with the ground truth.\", \"criterion_id\": \"efe892e8-3336-4d58-afc7-6400db760a08\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2711, "completion_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 2906}, "latency_s": 2.224904625036288, "request_id": "kPmUaeXSJY65kdUPzNPImQM", "raw_response": null}
