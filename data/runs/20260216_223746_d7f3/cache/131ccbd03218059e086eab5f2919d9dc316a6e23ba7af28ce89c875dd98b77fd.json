{"provider": "vercel_gateway", "model": "vercel_ai_gateway/openai/gpt-5.2", "text": "Under UK criminal law, the causation question would be addressed in two stages—**factual causation** and **legal causation**—and then by asking whether any intervening act (**novus actus interveniens**) breaks the chain. The analysis will differ slightly depending on whether you are looking at liability for the **truck driver** (who dropped the chair) or for the **drunk swerving driver** (who hit the other car), and depending on the specific offence charged (e.g., causing serious injury by dangerous driving; causing grievous bodily harm; gross negligence manslaughter, etc.). But the causation structure is broadly the same.\n\n## 1) Factual causation (“but for”)\n\n### (A) Truck driver (chair fell into road)\nAsk: **But for the chair falling into the road, would the serious injury have occurred?**  \nOn these facts, the chair is what triggers the swerve sequence, so a court would likely say **yes**: but for the chair being in the carriageway, the drunk driver would not have swerved into the adjacent car at that time, so the crash and injury likely would not have happened.\n\nSo factual causation is likely satisfied.\n\n### (B) Drunk driver (swerved into the adjacent car)\nAsk: **But for the drunk driver swerving into the other car, would the injury have occurred?**  \nLikely **no**—the collision he caused is an immediate precursor to the other car hitting the median and serious injury.\n\nSo factual causation is very likely satisfied.\n\n## 2) Legal causation (operating and substantial cause)\n\nEven if “but for” is satisfied, the defendant’s act must be an **operating and substantial cause** of the result (not necessarily the sole or main cause). The law tolerates multiple contributing causes.\n\n### (A) Drunk driver\nHis act (swerving into another vehicle) is very likely an **operating and substantial** cause of the crash and injury. His intoxication is also relevant to whether his driving is “dangerous,” but for causation purposes, the collision he caused is close in time and mechanism to the injury.\n\n### (B) Truck driver\nDropping an unsecured object into a live lane can be an operating cause, but the defence would argue the later swerving driver’s conduct is the real cause. The prosecution would argue the chair remained an **operative hazard** that set in motion a foreseeable chain of events. Whether it remains “substantial” will depend on detail (traffic speed, visibility, opportunity to avoid, etc.), but it is certainly arguable.\n\n## 3) Intervening acts (novus actus interveniens): does the drunk driver break the chain for the truck driver?\n\nThis is the key issue for the truck driver’s liability for the eventual serious injury.\n\n### General principles\nAn intervening act breaks the chain only if it is so **independent** of the defendant’s conduct and so **unforeseeable/extraordinary** that it makes it unjust to attribute the result to the defendant. Courts often ask whether the intervening act is “free, deliberate and informed,” but in road/accident contexts the analysis is usually framed as **foreseeability and whether the original act remains operative**.\n\n### Application here: swerving into the adjacent car\nA driver reacting badly to a road hazard is generally **foreseeable**. People may brake sharply, swerve, or collide—especially at motorway speeds. So **a reaction to avoid debris** is not usually treated as a chain-breaking event.\n\nHowever, two features strengthen the “chain break” argument:\n\n1. **The driver was drunk—double the legal limit**  \n   The more grossly negligent/reckless the intervening conduct, the more arguable it becomes that it is “extraordinary.” But intoxication does not automatically break causation; the question is whether this reaction was so abnormal that it should be treated as the true cause.\n\n2. **He swerved into a car next to him (not just losing control alone)**  \n   If a reasonable sober driver would likely have braked or steered safely and the collision only happened because the drunk driver made an extreme/irrational manoeuvre, the defence could argue the drunk driver’s conduct is an independent, overwhelming cause.\n\n### Likely outcome\n- For the **drunk driver**, causation is straightforward: his driving is a direct cause of the injury.\n- For the **truck driver**, a court is likely to treat the drunk driver’s response as a **contributing cause** rather than a complete novus actus, because:\n  - creating a motorway obstruction foreseeably creates a risk of sudden evasive manoeuvres and collisions; and\n  - the chair is part of the continuing dangerous situation.\n\nThat said, **the drunk driver’s extreme fault** (drunk, swerving into another vehicle) gives a realistic argument that his act is sufficiently independent and culpable to be regarded as the main cause, potentially preventing attributing the ultimate injury to the truck driver for result-crimes that require causation of serious injury/death. Courts are cautious about letting an initial wrongdoer escape liability merely because a second wrongdoer also acts badly, but they may limit the first party’s liability if the second actor’s conduct is truly exceptional.\n\n## 4) “Thin skull” and victims’ reactions\nIf the injured party in the second car had particular vulnerabilities, the defendant generally “takes the victim as found” (thin skull), but that’s not the main issue here. More relevant is the rule that **reasonable acts of escape/self-preservation** by victims or others typically do not break the chain; they are treated as foreseeable. The drunk driver’s manoeuvre may be characterised as *unreasonable*, but it is still a *reaction to the hazard*.\n\n## 5) Overall causation picture (most likely)\n- **Drunk driver:** factual + legal causation satisfied; no credible chain break between his swerve and the injury.\n- **Truck driver:** factual causation likely; legal causation arguable; the strongest defence is that the drunk driver’s grossly negligent driving is a novus actus. The likely prosecution position is that motorway debris foreseeably causes evasive actions and collisions, so the chain remains intact; the likely defence position is that the *particular* collision (swerving into the adjacent lane into another car) was driven by intoxication and is too independent/abnormal.\n\nIf you tell me what offence you have in mind (e.g., **causing serious injury by dangerous driving** for the drunk driver; or **gross negligence manslaughter** / **s.22A Health and Safety at Work Act** / **Road Traffic Act offences** for the truck driver), I can map the causation analysis more precisely to the elements and typical case approach for that charge.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 85, "completion_tokens": 1419, "total_tokens": 1504}, "latency_s": 28.128062083007535, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJ3HRMDZ65JP0J3AQQPHEK", "raw_response": null}
