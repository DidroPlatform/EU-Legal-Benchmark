The analysis correctly centers on the key English case law, specifically contrasting the older *Stone & Rolls* position with the definitive ruling in *Bilta (UK) Ltd v Nazir (No 2)*. The conclusion that the defense will fail because the liquidator sues for the benefit of innocent shareholders and creditors is accurate and directly supported by the reference answer's logic (though the reference answer is less detailed on the case law evolution). The candidate's structure and depth are superior to the reference answer, but the core legal conclusion aligns perfectly. The reference answer incorrectly states that the duty of care is not owed to creditors even in insolvency, which is a point the candidate correctly navigates by focusing on the *ex turpi causa* defense's failure in this context, rather than the scope of the duty itself (which is owed to the company). The candidate's analysis of *Bilta* is robust.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.95}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2446, "completion_tokens": 263, "total_tokens": 2709}, "latency_s": 1.5963267920014914, "request_id": "rMaUaYjLJdD-nsEPgIiFuAU", "raw_response": null}
