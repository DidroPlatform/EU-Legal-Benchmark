Option B follows the standard ECHR admissibility analysis pattern: first determining the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded under Article 35 § 3(a), then confirming no other inadmissibility grounds exist, and concluding with a declaration of admissibility. This is the typical formulation used when the Court proceeds to examine a complaint on the merits. Options A and D are rejection/inadmissibility formulations, and Option C presupposes a prior Article 8 violation finding and declines separate examination, which is a different procedural context.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 446, "completion_tokens": 157, "total_tokens": 603}, "latency_s": 4.799133833002998, "request_id": "chatcmpl-ff2e293d-9b67-4c0d-a8dd-d180441f9e75", "raw_response": null}
