In Swiss law, capacity to judge (Urteilsfähigkeit) is assessed specifically for each transaction or decision, not as an abstract general capacity.\n\n**Statement ii**: \"Judgments given in Swiss civil proceedings become res judicata not only between the parties but against any person who has an interest in the matter.\"\n- This is **incorrect**. Under Swiss law, res judicata generally applies only between the parties to the proceedings (inter partes effect), not erga omnes (against everyone). Third parties with interests are not automatically bound.\n\n**Statement iii**: \"It is a Swiss particularity that all major political parties are represented in the Federal Council. To this effect, the so-called magic formula was established (by practice, not based on an explicit provision in the Constitution).\"\n- This is **correct**. The \"magic formula\" (Zauberformel) is indeed a Swiss practice for proportional representation in the Federal Council, established by convention rather than constitutional mandate.\n\n**Statement iv**: \"The values 'power' and 'not power' constitute the political system's code according to the sociologist Niklas Luhmann.\"\n- This is **incorrect**. According to Luhmann's systems theory, the code of the political system is \"government/opposition\" or \"power/no power\" in terms of holding office, but more precisely \"superior/inferior\" or the binary code is typically described as \"government/opposition\" or \"power holder/non-power holder.\" However, the phrasing \"power and not power\" is an oversimplification and not Luhmann's precise formulation.\n\n**Statement v**: \"Spouses are subject to the provisions governing separation of property, provided they have not agreed otherwise in a marital agreement and provided no extraordinary marital property regime has come into effect.\"\n- This is **incorrect**. Under Swiss law (Art. 196 Swiss Civil Code), the default marital property regime is \"participation in acquired property\" (Errungenschaftsbeteiligung), not separation of property.\n\nIncorrect statements: ii, iv, and v\n\n{\"answer\": \"J\", \"reasoning\": \"Statements ii (res judicata effect), iv (Luhmann's political system code), and v (default marital property regime) are incorrect. Swiss law provides inter partes res judicata, Luhmann's formulation differs, and the default regime is participation in acquired property, not separation of property.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 568, "completion_tokens": 586, "total_tokens": 1154}, "latency_s": 11.135277791006956, "request_id": "chatcmpl-230d2eb8-61f6-41f2-8d34-7f836b87a482", "raw_response": null}
