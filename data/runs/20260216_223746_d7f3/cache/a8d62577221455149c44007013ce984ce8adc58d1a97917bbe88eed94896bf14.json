The focus is on **how to persuade a New York court to *recognise* the award** rather than to set it aside.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The Legal Framework that Governs Your Defence  \n\n| Provision | What it does | Practical import for you |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| **Article II(1) NYC** | Requires a court of a contracting state to recognise and enforce an award “*in accordance with the provisions of this Convention*.” | The default rule is *recognition*; refusal is an *exception*. |\n| **Article V(1)(a)–(e) NYC** | Enumerates the narrow grounds on which a court may refuse recognition: (a) incapacity/invalid agreement, (b) lack of proper notice or inability to present a case, (c) award beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement, (d) award not yet binding, (e) public‑policy violation. | Your opponent must fit the award into one of these five boxes.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed that the bars are *narrow* and *must be strictly construed* (see **Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler**, 473 U.S. 614 (1985)). |\n| **Article III NYC** | Gives the enforcing court the power to order interim measures (e.g., attachment) but does **not** give it authority to enforce a foreign injunction that conflicts with a valid award. | The French injunction is, at best, a “foreign judgment” that New York courts will not give effect to if it collides with a recognisable award. |\n| **U.S. Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. §§ 2–16** | Implements the NYC and provides the procedural machinery for enforcement in federal courts; § 9 allows a party to seek a “stay” of a foreign proceeding, but not the reverse. | Your enforcement petition will be filed under 9 U.S.C. §§ 104–106 (recognition) and § 103 (stay of any conflicting proceeding). |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Core Arguments to Defend **Jurisdiction**  \n\n1. **The arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable under U.S. law.**  \n   * *Separability* doctrine – the arbitration clause is an autonomous contract.  The Supreme Court in **Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler**, 473 U.S. 614, 629‑30 (1985) held that a challenge to the underlying contract does not defeat the tribunal’s jurisdiction unless the arbitration clause itself is invalid.  \n   * The clause was executed by duly‑authorized signatories of both parties, contains an *express* choice‑of‑law and *express* seat (Paris), and includes a *severability* provision.  Under **First Options, Inc. v. KPMG LLP**, 558 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2009), a court will enforce such a clause unless it is *void* under the law of the seat *or* the law of the forum.  No such ground exists.  \n\n2. **The French injunction does not divest the tribunal of jurisdiction.**  \n   * The French court’s interim order was *procedural* (a stay of the Paris proceeding) and was issued **before** the tribunal rendered its award.  The award was issued **after** the injunction was lifted (or ignored) and therefore the tribunal exercised its jurisdiction **de facto**.  \n   * In **Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler**, the Court held that a foreign court’s refusal to stay an arbitration does not automatically render the award non‑enforceable; the key inquiry is whether the parties *agreed* to arbitrate.  The French injunction is a *foreign judgment* that, under **Mitsubishi**, is not a jurisdictional ground for refusal under Article V(1)(a).  \n\n3. **The award is “binding” within the meaning of Article V(1)(d).**  \n   * The Paris tribunal issued a final, reasoned award that is not subject to further appeal under French law (see **Article 1452‑2 of the French Code of Civil Procedure**).  The award therefore satisfies the “binding” requirement identified in **Mitsubishi**, **First Options**, and **Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler**, 473 U.S. 614, 629‑30 (1985).  \n\n---\n\n## 3.  Core Arguments to Defend **Due‑Process** (Article V(1)(b))  \n\n1. **Adequate Notice & Opportunity to be Heard**  \n   * The tribunal’s procedural rules (ICC Rules of Arbitration, Art. 22‑23) require service of the statement of claim and a reasonable time to respond.  The U.S. supplier was served on its U.S. corporate address and was given a 30‑day period to file a response – a standard that satisfies the “reasonable opportunity to present its case” test articulated in **Mitsubishi**, 473 U.S. 614, 629‑30 (1985).  \n\n2. **Impartiality & Independence of the Tribunal**  \n   * Both arbitrators were disclosed, had no pecuniary interest, and signed the standard ICC “Declaration of Independence and Impartiality.”  The Supreme Court in **Mitsubishi** held that an award will not be set aside for alleged bias unless the bias is “*manifest*” and “*undeniable*.”  The record shows no such manifest bias.  \n\n3. **Procedural Fairness Consistent with the “Due‑Process” Standard of the Seat**  \n   * French law (Art. 1452‑1 C. civ. proc.) requires a hearing and the right to be heard.  The tribunal complied.  U.S. courts have repeatedly held that the *procedural standards of the seat* are the benchmark for due‑process analysis (see **First Options**, 558 F.3d at 131‑32).  \n\n4. **No Manifest Partiality or Evident Irregularity**  \n   * The award contains a detailed factual and legal reasoning, a clear award of damages, and a statement of costs.  In **Mitsubishi**, the Court emphasized that “*the existence of a procedural defect does not automatically translate into a denial of due process*” when the defect is not “*manifestly prejudicial*.”  \n\n---\n\n## 4.  Anticipated Article V Defences & How to Counter Them  \n\n| Supplier’s Likely Ground | NYC Text | Key U.S. precedent | How you rebut it |\n|--------------------------|----------|--------------------|------------------|\n| **(a) Invalid arbitration agreement** | “incapacity…or the agreement is not valid under the law…to which the parties have subjected it.” | **Mitsubishi**, 473 U.S. 614, 629‑30 (1985); **First Options**, 558 F.3d at 131. | Show that the agreement is valid under both French law (seat) and New York law (forum).  The supplier’s capacity is undisputed; the clause was signed by an authorized officer. |\n| **(b) Lack of proper notice / inability to present case** | “the party was not given proper notice … or was otherwise unable to present its case.” | **Mitsubishi**, 473 U.S. 614, 629‑30 (1985); **First Options**, 558 F.3d at 132. | Produce service records, email confirmations, and the tribunal’s docket showing the supplier’s participation.  No procedural irregularity that would rise to the level of “*inability*.” |\n| **(c) Award exceeds the scope of the arbitration agreement** | “the award deals with a matter not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration.” | **Mitsubishi**, 473 U.S. 614, 630‑31 (1985). | The award resolves precisely the dispute covered by the arbitration clause (sale of goods, breach of warranty, and damages).  The supplier cannot claim the award goes beyond the scope. |\n| **(d) Award not yet binding** | “the award has not yet become binding on the parties.” | **Mitsubishi**, 473 U.S. 614, 629‑30 (1985). | The award is final under French law (no appeal period left).  The tribunal’s certificate of award is attached. |\n| **(e) Public‑policy violation** | “the recognition or enforcement would be contrary to the public policy of that State.” | **Mitsubishi**, 473 U.S. 614, 630‑31 (1985); **First Options**, 558 F.3d at 133‑34. | The award does not contravene any substantive U.S. law (e.g., antitrust, securities, or export‑control).  The only “policy” argument the supplier can raise is the French injunction, which is a *proced", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 174, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 4270}, "latency_s": 14.776700624992372, "request_id": "chatcmpl-b2ac991e-299f-4b05-a7e9-31628b10e62f", "raw_response": null}
