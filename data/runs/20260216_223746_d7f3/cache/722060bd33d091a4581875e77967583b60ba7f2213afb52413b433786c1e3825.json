The candidate answer provides an estimated total potential exposure for Germany of \\u20ac160,000 - \\u20ac510,000, broken down into Defense costs (\\u20ac100,000 - \\u20ac300,000), Adverse costs risk (\\u20ac50,000 - \\u20ac150,000), and Court fees (\\u20ac10,000 - \\u20ac60,000). While the candidate provides a range for German costs, the specific required range of \\u20ac120,000\\u2013\\u20ac250,000 (including court fees) is not explicitly stated or derived from the provided breakdown. The candidate's lower bound (\\u20ac160,000) is outside the required lower bound (\\u20ac120,000), and the upper bound (\\u20ac510,000) is significantly higher than the required upper bound (\\u20ac250,000). Therefore, the specific quantification required by the rubric is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ade314f0-be16-4d74-aa37-90adfd3a778a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4290, "completion_tokens": 368, "total_tokens": 4658}, "latency_s": 1.2354791660036426, "request_id": "YMqUaZWJAZ6jnsEP0cGigAI", "raw_response": null}
