Under the section '2. Threat of German Court Proceedings,' the candidate discusses the risk of parallel litigation and mentions the New York Convention enforcement mechanism ('NY Convention Enforcement: Post-award, English award enforceable in Germany'). While it doesn't explicitly cite Article II(3) of the NY Convention or Section 9 of the English Arbitration Act 1996 directly in relation to staying the German proceedings, it correctly identifies the legal principle that the arbitration agreement should compel courts to stay or dismiss actions regarding the dispute. The discussion of the Anti-Suit Injunction (ASI) and the Lis Pendens rules (Brussels Ia Art. 27/29) serves as the practical mechanism to enforce the primacy of the arbitration agreement, which is the core function of NY Convention Art.
