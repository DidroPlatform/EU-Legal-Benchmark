The response discusses the general self-defence framework under s. 76 CJIA 2008, focusing on the common law/general statutory test (s. 76(3)-(7)). It does not mention s. 76(5A) at all, which specifically deals with householder defence and the 'grossly disproportionate' test. By omitting any mention of s. 76(5A) and focusing only on the general principles applicable to street altercations, the response implicitly confirms that the householder threshold is not relevant to this scenario, thereby satisfying the requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2f43efa2-6cd5-48c6-b8fd-1035de7d7d10\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2782, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 2992}, "latency_s": 0.9577646249963436, "request_id": "t8mUabWfO5TlnsEP9NTwiQU", "raw_response": null}
