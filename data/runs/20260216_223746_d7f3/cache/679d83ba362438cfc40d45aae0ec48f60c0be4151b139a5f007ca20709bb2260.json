The candidate answer explicitly addresses this in Section 3.3 ('Goods at risk' test and the risk registers) and Section 5 ('Burden of proof on \\u201cgoods at risk of being imported into the EU\\u201d'). It details the two-lane system (Green vs. Red) where the green lane is for goods staying in NI (and thus not at risk of entering the EU market from GB), and the red lane is for goods moving on to GB (which are treated as entering the EU customs territory). It also correctly identifies that the concept of 'at risk' is central to determining which checks apply, satisfying the core requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"180fd671-ce28-4f9a-a704-b66b61a7b661\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3977, "completion_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 4213}, "latency_s": 45.609380749985576, "request_id": "-vGUae2ABKzd7M8PqdSSsQM", "raw_response": null}
