The candidate answer explicitly argues the opposite: that the US injunction does not bind the tribunal or invalidate its jurisdictional ruling, and that ignoring the injunction was not a due process violation. Therefore, the response does not assert the condition described in the criterion, meaning the criterion is not met (i.e., the response does not make the prohibited assertion). Since the evaluation is whether the response *asserts* the condition, and it asserts the contrary, the criterion is satisfied in the sense that the response avoids the error described.\", \"criterion_id\": \"de5ab140-8126-4615-aadf-578d40e44047\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2021, "completion_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 2199}, "latency_s": 0.7624208749621175, "request_id": "yCiVad2nL62xnsEPvd25uQM", "raw_response": null}
