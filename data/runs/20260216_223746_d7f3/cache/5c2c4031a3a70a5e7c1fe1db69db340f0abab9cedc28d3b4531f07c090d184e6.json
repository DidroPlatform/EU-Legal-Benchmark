The structure is superior to the reference answer, using tables effectively and explicitly addressing the jurisdictional complexity (Norwegian/EEA context, US parent, Irish processor, Indian subsidiary). The reference answer is good but less detailed on the specific compliance measures and the interplay between the different legal regimes (e.g., explicitly mentioning the Swiss perspective, which is relevant given the context often implies a Swiss law exam setting, as noted by the candidate). The candidate correctly identifies the core risks (CLOUD Act conflict, corruption risk in India) and proposes detailed mitigation strategies. The only minor deviation is the candidate's initial section on 'Missing Factual Material,' which is good practice but not strictly required by the prompt, though it frames the subsequent analysis well. The coverage is comprehensive and highly accurate.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.95}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4557, "completion_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 4808}, "latency_s": 1.5510932079632767, "request_id": "JvSUaYn4Ca2WkdUPiJ3nmQk", "raw_response": null}
