The candidate answer correctly states: \\\"This is what the DUP boycott was about... The DUP opposed it [the Protocol] as a 'sea border' separating NI from the rest of the UK.\\\" It also correctly links the Stormont Brake (the core of the Framework) to the DUP's objection, noting they boycotted the Assembly over it. While the candidate states the boycott was *over* the Brake, the context provided clearly links the DUP's fundamental objection (the sea border/customs checks) to the boycott, which preceded the formal adoption of the Framework in Feb 2023, but was directly related to the Protocol which the Framework amended. The answer correctly identifies the DUP's objection (customs checks/sea border) as the reason for the boycott, satisfying the core intent of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"90be4298-6097-4725-81fc-cddffb2c4148\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1727, "completion_tokens": 262, "total_tokens": 1989}, "latency_s": 1.373601833009161, "request_id": "yOKUaaLiKofWvdIP3aGO4Ao", "raw_response": null}
