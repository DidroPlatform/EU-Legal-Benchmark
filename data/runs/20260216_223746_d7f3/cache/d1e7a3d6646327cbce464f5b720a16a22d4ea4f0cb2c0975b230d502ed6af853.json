The candidate response lists 'Work Visa (Nulla Osta + Entry Visa)', 'EU Blue Card', and mentions the need to apply for a 'residence permit (Permesso di Soggiorno)' after arrival. It also mentions the 'Nulla Osta' and 'entry visa'. While it mentions the residence permit, it does not explicitly list 'fiscal code' or 'contract of stay' (which is often implied by the Nulla Osta/Visa process but not listed as a distinct mandatory document in the same way as the others). Therefore, the exact list required by the criterion is not present.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4ef8a6cb-61e1-4645-9e39-e3b41c1890eb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3218, "completion_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 3421}, "latency_s": 0.8135824169730768, "request_id": "s_iUaaLRDYKN7M8Pn42j8Qg", "raw_response": null}
