Since the specific definition linked to *Bamford v Turnley* in the rubric was not quoted, the criterion is not strictly met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b82a1cc1-63cd-437f-82b2-81005bf2cd2e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1820, "completion_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 2044}, "latency_s": 0.990813790995162, "request_id": "NimVaaWnNKeN7M8P6NXVwQY", "raw_response": null}
