The candidate answer discusses the direct UK LP to SG alternative in the 'Treaty Benefit Hold-Up' section, noting the 0% WHT benefit under the UK-SG DTA, but it does not explicitly recommend this as the primary alternative structure to replace the CV route. Instead, it concludes by recommending a 'direct UK-SG claim + LO/APA' which implies a direct claim, but it doesn't frame the direct license as the structural alternative in the way the criterion implies (i.e., replacing the CV entirely with a direct license). The analysis focuses more on the failure of the CV route and the direct claim possibility.\", \"criterion_id\": \"72aa565f-a738-438c-8c38-ba8eb6d9b55a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1055, "completion_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 1260}, "latency_s": 0.7725332499830984, "request_id": "eCOVafWcMtqfnsEPzfyNyAM", "raw_response": null}
