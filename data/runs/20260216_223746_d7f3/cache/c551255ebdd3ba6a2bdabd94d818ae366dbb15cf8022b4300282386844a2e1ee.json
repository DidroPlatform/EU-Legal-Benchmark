The candidate answer discusses the difference between Dirigente and Quadro/Impiegato in Italy, noting that classification depends on duties and CCNL, and that Dirigente status can increase employer cost. However, it does not explicitly state that misclassifying a Quadro as a Dirigente (or vice versa, depending on the context of 'wrongfully employing') could lead to a labor-law lawsuit. The discussion is about cost and benefits, not the legal risk of misclassification leading to a lawsuit.\", \"criterion_id\": \"05dcf770-c816-440d-abf5-4b4e9ed030fb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2381, "completion_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 2572}, "latency_s": 1.000181125011295, "request_id": "ExiVadnALdfIvdIPlo3gqAY", "raw_response": null}
