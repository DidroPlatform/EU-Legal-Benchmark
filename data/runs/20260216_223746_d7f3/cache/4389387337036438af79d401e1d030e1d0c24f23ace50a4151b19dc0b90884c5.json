The case R v Keane is not mentioned or applied in the candidate answer. Furthermore, the facts state the client struck the victim *after* the victim attacked him, meaning the client is claiming self-defence against the victim's initial attack, not that the client attacked first and is seeking revival of the defence. The response discusses the general principles of self-defence, mistaken belief, and proportionality, but it fails to address the specific legal concept implied by the reference to 'R v Keane' in the context of a sequence of attacks (which usually relates to the loss of the right to self-defence after initiating violence, or the revival of the right after excessive retaliation by the initial aggressor). Since the specific case and the required application are absent, the criterion is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"653cb3de-b54e-4fad-a0f4-e0a95a9f150d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3254, "completion_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 3512}, "latency_s": 1.2833898750250228, "request_id": "qeeUabXYC82Lxs0P7OuNSA", "raw_response": null}
