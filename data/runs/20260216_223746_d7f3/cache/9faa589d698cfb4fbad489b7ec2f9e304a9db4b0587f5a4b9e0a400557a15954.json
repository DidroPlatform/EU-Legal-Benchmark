The candidate answer discusses various types of claims (possession, money claim, breach of terms) and lists evidence relevant to different scenarios, such as rent arrears (Section 8 grounds 8, 10, 11) and breach of tenancy (noise, nuisance, subletting, pets). While it lists multiple *potential* breaches that a landlord might allege (rent arrears, damage, nuisance, subletting), it does not explicitly state two distinct types of breach that the *tenant* might have committed as examples of what they need to defend against, beyond mentioning rent arrears and then listing other types of breach allegations in Section 3. However, the structure clearly separates 'rent arrears' from 'breach of tenancy (noise, nuisance, subletting, pets)' and 'damage to property' (implied in the evidence section D). The response covers rent arrears and damage/nuisance/subletting as distinct categories of alleged breach, satisfying the requirement to mention at least two distinct types of tenancy breach that might form the basis of a dispute.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8a3d1e61-d07b-42b4-9e15-bf239c2edd27\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2188, "completion_tokens": 294, "total_tokens": 2482}, "latency_s": 0.9450965410214849, "request_id": "kR2VaaubNfjHnsEP9ouZ4Qg", "raw_response": null}
