The candidate answer explicitly argues the opposite: that the truck driver's negligence 'does not break the chain of causation' and therefore the truck driver's negligence would *not* lead to the truck driver being found liable for the injury caused by the drunk driver's subsequent actions. The candidate answer focuses on establishing the drunk driver's liability, not the truck driver's partial liability alongside the drunk driver.\", \"criterion_id\": \"13ad59d3-0614-44b5-9ff4-b6db76ef2755\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2066, "completion_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 2246}, "latency_s": 0.869601208018139, "request_id": "Lf-UaaWfI9uxnsEPg_7zyAU", "raw_response": null}
