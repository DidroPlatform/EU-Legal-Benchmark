The candidate answer directly addresses this by suggesting methods to secure the youngest daughter's position, including creating a will that explicitly states wishes, using non-probate transfers, and executing advance directives that explicitly exclude the older daughters from medical decision-making. This directly infers and addresses the user's implied wish to prioritize the youngest, potentially at the expense of the older daughters (disenfranchisement/disinheritance).\", \"criterion_id\": \"007214ce-2874-463e-b71b-15406a88c595\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 764, "completion_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 940}, "latency_s": 1.4305319580016658, "request_id": "LsqUacjcCqqEkdUPzIWYoAI", "raw_response": null}
