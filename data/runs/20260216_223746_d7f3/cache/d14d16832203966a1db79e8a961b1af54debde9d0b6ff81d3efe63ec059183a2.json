However, upon closer inspection of the text, the candidate answer *does* state: \\\"In Mexico, any transaction meeting the thresholds set forth in the **Ley Federal de Competencia Econ\\u00f3mica (LFCE)** must be notified to the Federal Economic Competition Commission (COFECE) prior to closing.\\\" This explicitly names the required law and the required authority (COFECE).
