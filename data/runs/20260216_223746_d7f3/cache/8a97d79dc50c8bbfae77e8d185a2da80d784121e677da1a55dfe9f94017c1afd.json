The candidate answer discusses the possibility of an award being set aside under Article V(1)(e) (which relates to the award not being binding or having been set aside) and cites *Chromalloy Aeroservices v. Arab Republic of Egypt* for the proposition that a US court can enforce an award even if it has been set aside in the seat country. However, the criterion specifically references **Article VII(1)**, which deals with the ability of a court to apply its own domestic law to grant greater rights of enforcement than the Convention provides, not the enforcement of an award *set aside* under the Convention's refusal grounds (Article V). While the answer touches upon the enforcement of set-aside awards, it does so in the context of Article V(1)(e) and does not explicitly state the authority to enforce an award set aside *under Article VII(1)*, which is the specific requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"741dc166-2b6b-4fcb-8301-a01449cd57b1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3998, "completion_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 4273}, "latency_s": 1.6183626249840017, "request_id": "AL6UaaSaNNyWkdUPpoLOyQM", "raw_response": null}
