When the officers approached a Spanish vessel to seek information, the Spanish officers on board refused to cooperate.\n\nUnder Article 9(5) of the Convention, authorized officers have the power to seek information from vessels. Furthermore, Article 9(10) states that resistance by a vessel to the directions of an authorized officer shall be deemed as resistance to the authority of the flag State of that vessel.\n\nGiven that Spain's reservation to Article 9(5) and (6) does not apply to Belgium, as Belgium has not made a reservation against Spain under Article 14(3), these provisions are binding between Belgium and Spain.\n\nTherefore, the review board is likely to decide that the Spanish vessel's refusal to cooperate with the Belgian authorized officers constitutes a violation of the Convention under Article 9(10).\n\nWe advise that Spain consider this interpretation when preparing its response to the review board.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Your Name]\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 12783, "completion_tokens": 3208, "total_tokens": 15991}, "latency_s": 109.97674675000599, "request_id": "db5e65783db8436ba9e640628eaca47b", "raw_response": null}
