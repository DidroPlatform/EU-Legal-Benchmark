However, the specific criterion being evaluated requires a distinction between UK, US (California), and German **evidence rules**, specifically mentioning written submissions (Germany), limited disclosure (UK), and depositions/e-discovery (California). While the candidate discusses 'Discovery risks' in the California section and mentions UK disclosure rules (CPR Pt 31), and notes Germany's limited discovery, it does not explicitly contrast the *evidence rules* in the manner required by the criterion (e.g., Germany's reliance on written submissions vs. US oral depositions). The discussion is focused on discovery scope and cost rather than the fundamental procedural differences in evidence presentation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ca0097fe-6cb1-457f-925b-1a1e4893f212\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4291, "completion_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 4504}, "latency_s": 1.048815874994034, "request_id": "pUqUafXUHNXcvdIPlpOxoAM", "raw_response": null}
