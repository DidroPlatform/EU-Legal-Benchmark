Section 2.1 (s.76 CJIA 2008) and Section 3 (Impact of Honest but Mistaken Belief) explicitly cover this. Specifically, Section 2.1 notes that s.76(4) dictates reasonableness is judged by circumstances as D believed them to be, and Section 3 confirms that an honest but mistaken belief (e.g., victim armed) is sufficient and must be considered by the jury, referencing *Beckford v R* and *R v Williams (Gladstone)*. The brief clearly advises that the jury assesses force based on the circumstances *as he believed them to be*.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3638b3ae-0c64-4892-b3cc-fc12739096a1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2245, "completion_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 2473}, "latency_s": 0.7523621669970453, "request_id": "XSWVaYP9L-jpnsEP173biQg", "raw_response": null}
