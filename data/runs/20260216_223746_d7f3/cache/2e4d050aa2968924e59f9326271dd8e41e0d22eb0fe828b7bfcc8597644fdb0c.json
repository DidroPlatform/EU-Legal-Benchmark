{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 0, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires the response to define the difference between long-term and short-term employment. The response discusses the 'Posting' regime (Section 3.2.1) which is limited to up to 24 months (or 36 months in some cases), implying a short-term arrangement. It contrasts this with the situation where the posting limit is exceeded, leading to the need to pay Italian INPS, which suggests a shift to a long-term arrangement. However, the response never explicitly defines or contrasts 'long-term employment' versus 'short-term employment' as distinct concepts or durations, only using the 24-month posting limit as a threshold for cost comparison.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c5653ab7-1a87-4d10-b857-f4acce0c8990\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4728, "completion_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 4920}, "latency_s": 3.560362084012013, "request_id": "9eiUaYvTI4mkxN8PnqLAgQQ", "raw_response": null}
