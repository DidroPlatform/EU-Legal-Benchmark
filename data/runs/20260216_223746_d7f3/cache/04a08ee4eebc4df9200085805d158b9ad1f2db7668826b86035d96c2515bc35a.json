Tag-Along Right (Mitveräußerungsrecht)' and defines its purpose: 'If the founders sell their 60%, you must not be left behind as a trapped 25% minority in a company controlled by a stranger. Tag-along is your exit insurance.' It further specifies the required terms: 'Full tag-along: if founders sell any shares, you can sell on the same terms, pro rata.' This clearly defines the right as ensuring the investor can sell a pro rata portion of shares alongside the founders on the same terms.\", \"criterion_id\": \"32a99ce4-2e4a-42d1-bf72-6db07c939b16\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4122, "completion_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 4301}, "latency_s": 0.8148468339932151, "request_id": "kr-Uac6HJ8TV7M8PzpbtcQ", "raw_response": null}
