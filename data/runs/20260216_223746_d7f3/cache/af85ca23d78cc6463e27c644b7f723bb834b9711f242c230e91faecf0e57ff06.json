While it doesn't use the exact phrasing 'placing the protected person in a care facility or significantly changing their living arrangements,' the context of needing prior authorization for extraordinary acts strongly implies control over major life decisions like relocation or placement in a care facility (which is often considered an extraordinary act requiring judicial oversight in Italian guardianship law, as implied by the mention of 'Arranging care — hiring caregivers, managing placement in a RSA (care home) if needed' under practical responsibilities). Furthermore, the section on 'What the Court Decides' notes the decree specifies 'The specific acts the guardian can perform on behalf of the beneficiary (*in nome e per conto*)' and 'The specific acts for which the guardian must merely assist or give consent alongside the beneficiary,' which covers the scope of decision-making regarding living arrangements.
