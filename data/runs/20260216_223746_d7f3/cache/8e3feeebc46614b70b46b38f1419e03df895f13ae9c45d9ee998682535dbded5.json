The candidate answer discusses the possibility of using private law contracts and mentions that the GIP's legal status (predominantly public vs. mixed/private) influences the applicable rules, and that the GIP's statutes must allow private law recruitment. However, it does not explicitly state the condition that the GIP *may instead be governed by public law if its purpose or constitutive convention requires it*, which is the specific point being evaluated. It implies the flexibility but misses the direct statement about the public law default/requirement based on purpose/convention.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4497b5d2-6bd3-4985-9d36-5802ba306a90\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1266, "completion_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 1456}, "latency_s": 1.8687344589852728, "request_id": "WPSUaZrMHYOH7M8PxuqcmAk", "raw_response": null}
