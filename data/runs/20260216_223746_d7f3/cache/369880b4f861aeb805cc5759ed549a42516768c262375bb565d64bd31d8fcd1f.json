It correctly links the GDPR applicability due to Norway/EEA status. The reference answer focuses heavily on the GDPR/CLOUD Act nexus and the UK Bribery Act/FCPA, which the candidate also covers well. The candidate's structure is clear, and it correctly identifies the cross-border complexity. The candidate misses the specific nuance of the cloud service models (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS) mentioned in the reference, but covers the core risks adequately. The candidate's discussion of data transfer risk (US parent) is strong, mirroring the reference's concern about the CLOUD Act indirectly via the Schrems II reference. The score reflects high relevance and accuracy, though slightly less granular than the reference on cloud models.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.85}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1331, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 1565}, "latency_s": 0.9691555830067955, "request_id": "sxOVae2YLrPTvdIPh7q28Qo", "raw_response": null}
