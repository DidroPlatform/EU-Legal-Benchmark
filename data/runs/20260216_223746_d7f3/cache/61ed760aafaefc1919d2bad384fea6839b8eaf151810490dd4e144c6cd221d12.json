The candidate answer mentions 'Fair Dealing' and states it's unlikely to apply because the use is commercial, but it does not explicitly mention the TDM exception (which is the relevant exception for large-scale scraping/training under UK law, specifically Section 29A of the CDPA 1988, which has a commercial use carve-out).
