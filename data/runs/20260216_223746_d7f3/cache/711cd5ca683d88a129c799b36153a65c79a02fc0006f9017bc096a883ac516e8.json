The candidate answer discusses the court's power to grant freezing injunctions even when arbitration is underway elsewhere (Singapore). It focuses on the balancing test between court support (AA 1996 s.44) and respecting the arbitration agreement. While the answer mentions enforceability abroad (Section 3, Step 6, and Section 5, Step 4), which implies the practical limitation of where the order can be enforced, it does not explicitly state that the *English court's jurisdiction* to grant the injunction is limited only to assets physically located in England. English courts can grant worldwide freezing orders (Mareva injunctions) against defendants subject to their jurisdiction, regardless of where the assets are located, provided there is a sufficient connection to the jurisdiction (e.g., the defendant is resident or the claim has a strong nexus to England). The response focuses on *when* the court will exercise its power, not on a jurisdictional limitation based solely on asset location, thus failing to satisfy the specific negative constraint implied by the criterion's phrasing (i.e., the response does not suggest this limitation).\", \"criterion_id\": \"1ecca6f8-3c08-4562-8fa2-0491fea32bb3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3874, "completion_tokens": 296, "total_tokens": 4170}, "latency_s": 1.200739166000858, "request_id": "0eqUadebEfminsEP9fLK0AM", "raw_response": null}
