The candidate answer explicitly lists 'Medical certificates: From GP/specialist (neurologist/psychiatrist) describing condition (e.g., dementia, illness). Include ASL (local health authority) report if possible' under the required documents, and mentions the 'Medical expert (CTU - Consulenza Tecnica d'Ufficio) for diagnosis' as part of the court's decision process. This shows the response correctly identifies medical evaluations as a necessary part of the process, directly contradicting the negative condition of the rubric criterion. Therefore, the criterion is satisfied (i.e., the response does *not* suggest bypassing them).\", \"criterion_id\": \"48a132e3-217c-43ca-a4f5-6592d73f5413\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1439, "completion_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 1638}, "latency_s": 0.741019791981671, "request_id": "JiWVafLnLpHw7M8Pi4iBgAU", "raw_response": null}
