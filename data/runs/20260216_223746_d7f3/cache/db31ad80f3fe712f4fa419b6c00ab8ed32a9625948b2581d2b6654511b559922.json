The candidate answer discusses share exchanges and contributions in Section 1 and Section 2 (e.g., 'share-for-share exchange' in Luxembourg context, 'issuance of shares' in Brazil context), but it never explicitly states or explains the necessity of reissuing or adjusting *share classes or quotas* within the local entities (Brazil, Chile, Mexico) specifically to maintain the *ownership ratios* established at the holding level.
