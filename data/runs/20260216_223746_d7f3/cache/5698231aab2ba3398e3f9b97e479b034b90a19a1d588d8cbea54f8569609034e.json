Statement ii is incorrect - legal sociology does not follow the same formal logic as legal doctrine; it uses empirical methods rather than doctrinal reasoning. Statement iii is correct - the Responsible Business Initiative (if passed) would create liability for Swiss multinationals regarding foreign subsidiary conduct. Statement iv is incorrect - legal sociology recommends using compatible, coherent theories and maintaining the is/ought distinction, not using incompatible theories simultaneously. Statement v is incorrect - Swiss law on recognition of foreign judgments and insolvency decrees does not require reciprocity; Switzerland can recognize foreign decisions even if the originating state would not reciprocate. Therefore, statements ii, iv, and v are incorrect.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 423, "completion_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 608}, "latency_s": 4.121287542016944, "request_id": "chatcmpl-802cc236-1874-4744-9653-4d9c9e9d6823", "raw_response": null}
