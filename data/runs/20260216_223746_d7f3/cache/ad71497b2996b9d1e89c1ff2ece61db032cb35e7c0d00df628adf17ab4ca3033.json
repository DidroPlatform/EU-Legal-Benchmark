This relates specifically to the concept of overriding interests under land registration law (e.g., Schedule 3, Paragraph 2 of the Land Registration Act 2002). The candidate answer focuses almost entirely on the occupier's status (licensee vs. tenant) and the procedural requirements for eviction (notice to quit, court order). It does not mention the concept of 'overriding interests' or the test of 'obviousness on a reasonably careful inspection' in the context of the buyer's priority, which is the core requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"597adb56-e410-4f1a-95df-758a819dfa0c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3349, "completion_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 3557}, "latency_s": 1.0189124169992283, "request_id": "dOWUaZ6oBJ6YvdIP0OSwgAI", "raw_response": null}
