The candidate answer focuses almost entirely on the property dispute, specifically the priority of the lender's charge versus the user's equitable interest. While it mentions the lender may have a claim against the ex personally, it does not explicitly state that the user's personal claim (like breach of trust or unjust enrichment) is enforceable against the ex's *other* assets, which is the core requirement of the criterion. The advice is centered on fighting the charge on the property.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ae70b466-524f-4800-bd58-e231000255cf\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1848, "completion_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 2031}, "latency_s": 1.1210812920180615, "request_id": "oLiUad3sNf3onsEP3cCnyQM", "raw_response": null}
