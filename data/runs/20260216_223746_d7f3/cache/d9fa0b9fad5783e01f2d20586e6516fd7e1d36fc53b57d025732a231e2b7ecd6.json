The conclusion in Section 6, supported by the cost comparison table, indicates that Option B (UK subsidiary posting for up to 24 months) results in a lower immediate cash outlay for the employer (approx. +14-15% vs. +24-25% for Option A, assuming the *dirigente* status is achieved in Option A). Therefore, the response provides a preferable option based on the given information (minimizing employer cost in the short term).\", \"criterion_id\": \"887fd3f3-7bf5-4734-9865-55a4d162238f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4732, "completion_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 4922}, "latency_s": 0.8467327089747414, "request_id": "9-iUaYSZNd_evdIPi9bMuAs", "raw_response": null}
