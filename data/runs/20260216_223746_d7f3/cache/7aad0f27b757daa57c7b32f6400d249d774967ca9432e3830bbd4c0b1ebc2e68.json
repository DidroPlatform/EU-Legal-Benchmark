The candidate answer refers extensively to section 44 AA 1996, specifically mentioning s.44(2)(e) in section 2(A) and discussing circumstances where the tribunal has not been constituted or lacks power to act. However, it never explicitly mentions or quotes section 44(5). Section 44(5) is crucial as it dictates that the court shall not exercise its power under section 44(2) if the tribunal has already been empowered by the parties to grant the relief sought. Since the criterion specifically demands reference to s.44(5), and the answer omits it while discussing related concepts under s.44, the criterion is not strictly met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c7d0a35b-d271-40ea-abdb-6ccbc57840f5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2796, "completion_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 3029}, "latency_s": 1.8559514579828829, "request_id": "P_qUaaO0Eu3_nsEPyaqlqAk", "raw_response": null}
