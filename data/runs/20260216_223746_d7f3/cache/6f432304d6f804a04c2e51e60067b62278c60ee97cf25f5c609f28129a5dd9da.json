Specifically, under 'Immediate Response to ICC Notice,' it advises filing counterclaims immediately to frame the issue as wrongful termination/breach, and under 'Anti-German Court Tactics,' it advises sending a cease-and-desist or applying for an Anti-Suit Injunction (ASI) to prevent German court litigation. This directly addresses all components of the criterion: framing the issue (breach of contract), controlling timing (filing first/immediate response), presenting first (filing counterclaims), and preventing German court litigation (ASI threat/application).\", \"criterion_id\": \"b3b4595a-b14f-442f-84fc-b1ac2fc6c311\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2098, "completion_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 2297}, "latency_s": 1.010554582986515, "request_id": "-DGVaea8MMjl7M8P9OOViAY", "raw_response": null}
