{"provider": "nim", "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", "text": " **Yes, the injunction can stand**, but its scope and duration depend heavily on whether assets are located in England and whether the Singapore tribunal can \"act effectively.\" English courts will not automatically defer to the Singapore arbitration, but they will exercise caution to avoid undermining the arbitral seat.\n\nHere is how the English courts approach this balancing exercise:\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Statutory Routes for Freezing Relief\nEnglish courts have two principal routes to grant freezing injunctions (Mareva orders) in support of foreign-seated arbitrations:\n\n**A. Section 44 of the Arbitration Act 1996**\nThis is the primary vehicle. Although the arbitration is seated in Singapore, **s.44(4)** explicitly permits English courts to grant interim injunctions provided that **\"the arbitral tribunal has no power or is unable to act effectively.\"**\n\n*   **Unable to Act Effectively:** This is the key test. It covers situations where:\n    *   The tribunal is not yet constituted (urgency);\n    *   The assets are located in England and the tribunal has no power over third parties (e.g., English banks holding the funds);\n    *   The respondent is likely to dissipate assets before the tribunal can order conservatory measures.\n    \n    If the assets are in Singapore and the tribunal is already constituted and able to issue orders, the English court is unlikely to intervene under s.44, as this would usurp the seat court’s primary role.\n\n**B. Section 25 Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982**\nAlternatively, the court may rely on its general power to grant interim relief in support of foreign proceedings (including arbitrations). Following *Credit Suisse Fides Trust SA v Cuoghi* [1997], this route does not require the applicant to demonstrate that the foreign tribunal is \"unable to act,\" but it still requires a strong connecting factor to England—typically the presence of assets within the jurisdiction.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Balancing Exercise: English Jurisdiction vs. the Singapore Seat\n\nWhen the English court considers the application, it balances its willingness to assist the arbitration against the principle of **comity** (respect for the Singapore courts as the supervisory jurisdiction).\n\n#### A. Location of Assets is Decisive\n*   **Assets in England:** If the foreign company holds assets in England (bank accounts, real property, shares), the English court has a strong independent basis to freeze them. This is viewed as protective relief that does not interfere with the Singapore tribunal’s authority to decide the merits. The court will likely grant the order subject to the applicant undertaking to inform the Singapore tribunal and court immediately (*Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. v Vitol S.A.* [2020]).\n*   **Assets Outside England (Worldwide Freezing Orders):** The court is far more cautious. It will only grant a WFO if there is a \"sufficient connection\" to England (e.g., the defendant is subject to English personal jurisdiction, or the contract has strong English law elements) and the Singapore courts cannot effectively protect the assets. This is rare and requires the applicant to show the respondent is hiding assets from the Singapore tribunal.\n\n#### B. The \"Unable to Act Effectively\" Analysis\nIf the tribunal is already constituted in Singapore, the English court will ask:\n*   Can the tribunal issue a similar freezing order? (Yes, Singapore courts/tribunals can issue Mareva-type relief).\n*   Can the tribunal’s orders be enforced quickly enough against English assets?\n*   Is there extreme urgency preventing recourse to the tribunal?\n\nIf the Singapore tribunal could have granted the relief but the applicant simply chose not to ask, the English court may refuse the injunction as an abuse of process or forum shopping.\n\n#### C. Risk of Conflicting Orders\nThe court will consider whether granting the injunction risks creating conflicting obligations. If the Singapore courts have already issued a contradictory order, or if the respondent demonstrates that Singapore law prohibits compliance with the English order, the English court may modify or discharge its injunction to avoid putting the respondent in breach of a Singapore order (*Gerald Metals SA v Timis Mining Corporation Ltd* [2016]).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Practical Considerations\n\n*   **Full and Frank Disclosure:** The applicant must disclose the existence of the Singapore arbitration and any applications made there. Failure to do so risks the injunction being set aside.\n*   **Undertakings:** The applicant will usually be required to give an undertaking to apply to the Singapore tribunal for concurrent relief and to notify the Singapore court.\n*   **Service:** Serving the injunction on a foreign company requires permission under CPR Part 6, and the court must be satisfied that England is the proper place for the application (usually satisfied by the presence of assets).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\n**The injunction will likely stand if:**\n1.  There are assets within England that require protection; and/or\n2.  The Singapore tribunal is unable to secure those assets effectively (e.g., because they are held by English third parties).\n\n**The injunction is vulnerable if:**\n1.  The applicant could easily obtain equivalent relief from the Singapore courts/tribunal but failed to do so;\n2.  There are no assets in England and no substantial connection to the jurisdiction; or\n3.  Granting it would conflict with orders already made by the Singapore courts.\n\nThe English courts view freezing injunctions as **supportive** of the arbitral process rather than competitive with it. Provided the relief is necessary to preserve assets that the Singapore tribunal cannot practically reach, the injunction will be maintained, but the applicant must act with utmost good faith toward both the English court and the Singapore proceedings.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 53, "completion_tokens": 3023, "total_tokens": 3076}, "latency_s": 59.45763916699798, "request_id": "chatcmpl-a3051a3009fa4c85", "raw_response": null}
