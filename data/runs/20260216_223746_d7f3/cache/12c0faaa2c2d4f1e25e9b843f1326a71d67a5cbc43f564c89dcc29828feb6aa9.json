In legal systems, capacity of judgment (or legal capacity) is indeed assessed contextually based on the specific transaction or event, not in abstract terms. Different transactions may require different levels of capacity.\n\n**Statement ii**: \"The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG) is mainly financed by a levy, which all households in Switzerland are required to pay. This ensures the SRG to fulfil its mandate in favour of democracy, cohesion and in reaching the entire population.\"\n\nThis statement is **correct**. The SRG SSR is indeed financed primarily through a mandatory household levy (Billag fee, now Serafe), which supports its public service mandate.\n\n**Statement iii**: \"What should be protected by means of human rights depends on, amongst other things, a background theory of human goods.\"\n\nThis statement is **correct**. This reflects philosophical and theoretical approaches to human rights, where determining what rights should be protected depends on underlying theories about human dignity, human goods, and what is essential for human flourishing.\n\n**Statement iv**: \"The 'Digest' (or 'Pandects') compiled and promulgated in Constantinople in the 6th century CE by order of Justinian I.\"\n\nThis statement is **correct**. The Digest (Digesta or Pandects) was indeed compiled under Emperor Justinian I's orders and promulgated in 533 CE in Constantinople as part of the Corpus Juris Civilis.\n\nAll statements appear to be correct, so the answer would be \"none of the statements\" are incorrect.\n\n{\"answer\": \"D\", \"reasoning\": \"All four statements are factually correct: (i) correctly describes contextual capacity assessment, (ii) accurately describes SRG financing, (iii) correctly reflects human rights theory, and (iv) accurately describes Justinian's Digest compilation in 6th century Constantinople.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 312, "completion_tokens": 455, "total_tokens": 767}, "latency_s": 7.032483833987499, "request_id": "chatcmpl-29fa786a-cfb2-444e-955e-0194e85149ed", "raw_response": null}
