The candidate answer discusses foreseeability and the possibility of the truck driver being liable, concluding that the chain is *probably* not broken. It does not explicitly address the scenario where the drunk driver's swerve is deemed *not negligent* (i.e., a reasonable person would have done the same) and what the consequence of that specific finding would be regarding the truck driver's total liability. The analysis focuses on whether the swerve breaks the chain, not on the specific condition mentioned in the criterion regarding the lack of negligence.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ff67bf61-062a-4cca-acf8-5003202b85d7\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2700, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 2901}, "latency_s": 0.8613282080041245, "request_id": "r8KUabfaEfOekdUPoeqlcA", "raw_response": null}
