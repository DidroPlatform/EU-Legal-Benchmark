The candidate answer focuses heavily on the liability of the drunk driver and the truck owner/driver, correctly identifying the drunk driver's intoxication as a key factor. However, it never discusses the visibility of the chair as a factor in assessing the *drunk driver's* reaction or whether that reaction was reasonable/foreseeable in the context of the initial hazard (the chair). The analysis of the truck driver's response is mentioned, but the visibility of the chair is not linked to the drunk driver's decision to swerve.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d2abf342-9ee3-4014-82e6-c59502d6c44a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1148, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 1362}, "latency_s": 5.279851209023036, "request_id": "AOGUaaXABq3hnsEP0oDs0QE", "raw_response": null}
