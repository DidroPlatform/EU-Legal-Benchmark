{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"score\": 0.85, \"pass\": true, \"rationale\": \"The candidate provides a detailed answer grounded in Swiss corporate law (OR), which is a valid approach when the specific jurisdiction isn't defined, although the reference answer implies a general/US context (mentioning New Jersey case law). The answer correctly identifies the core debate: shareholder wealth maximization vs. broader social responsibility (CSR/Stakeholder theory).\\n\\n**Alignment with Reference Points:**\\n1. **Purpose of Corporation/Shareholder Wealth Maximization:** Addressed by contrasting the Friedman view with Swiss law's focus on 'Gesellschaftsinteresse' (Art. 717 OR) rather than pure profit maximization.\\n2. **Broader Social Responsibilities/CSR:** Discussed extensively under Section 2 and 3, linking stakeholder interests (employees, environment, community) to legal duties (compliance, risk management, ESG reporting).\\n3. **Social Institution Model/Stakeholder Obligations:** Implicitly covered by discussing the legal relevance of stakeholder interests (employees, suppliers, environment) as risk factors influencing long-term company interest.\\n4. **Corporate Purpose/Legal Framework:** The answer explicitly discusses the statutory purpose (Zweckbindung) and the duties of the Board (VR) under OR, which aligns with discussing corporate law theories.\\n\\n**Strengths:** The answer is structured, legally rigorous (citing specific OR articles like 716a, 717, 964a, 964j), and directly refutes the absolute nature of the proposition based on legal constraints (legality principle, ESG reporting).\\n\\n**Weakness/Deviation:** It does not explicitly cite the New Jersey Supreme Court case or Parkinson's/Dine's specific theories, which the reference answer marks as 'extra credit'. However, the core requirements are met robustly through the application of relevant corporate governance principles.\\n\\nThe overall coverage of the required themes (purpose, shareholder vs. stakeholder, legal constraints on profit) is excellent, justifying a high score.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.85}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2740, "completion_tokens": 441, "total_tokens": 3181}, "latency_s": 2.7262869579717517, "request_id": "UiKVaYzdGqjlnsEP1bugwAM", "raw_response": null}
