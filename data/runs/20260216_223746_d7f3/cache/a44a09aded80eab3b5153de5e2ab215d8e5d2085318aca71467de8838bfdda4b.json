As a UK-based artist/graphic novelist, you're not screwed at all by not \"registering\" anything (more on that below). I'll break this down step-by-step based on current UK copyright law, with a focus on your situation. **Important disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, and this isn't formal legal advice. Copyright/AI law is evolving fast (especially with cases like Getty Images v Stability AI), so consult a solicitor specializing in IP/AI (e.g., via the IPO's pro bono clinic or Law Society finder) ASAP for your specifics. They can review your work and advise on free/low-cost options.**\n\n### 1. **Your Copyright Exists Automatically—No Registration Needed**\n   - In the UK (under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, or CDPA), copyright protection kicks in the **moment you create and fix** your work (e.g., drawing/saving those 40 pages). No registration, deposit, or formalities required—unlike the US.\n   - Posting online (e.g., on your site, Patreon, Webtoon) **doesn't waive your rights**. It actually helps prove ownership (timestamps, metadata, witnesses/fans).\n   - Your work qualifies as an **artistic work** (illustrations, characters like Ophelia). Protection lasts your life + 70 years.\n   - **Bottom line**: Not registering changes nothing. You have full rights as the \"author.\" Synthetic Dreams Corp (SDC) and their users can't just \"cannibalize\" it.\n\n### 2. **Did SDC Infringe by Scraping and Training Their Model?**\n   - **Scraping**: If they copied your full 40 pages (or substantial parts) without permission, that's likely **reproduction infringement** (CDPA s.16-17). Even temporary copies for training count.\n     - UK has **text and data mining (TDM) exceptions** (CDPA ss.29A/29B, added 2014):\n       | Exception | Applies to SDC? |\n       |-----------|-----------------|\n       | **s.29A (non-commercial research)** | No—they're a commercial AI company selling access. |\n       | **s.29B (commercial TDM)** | Maybe, but only if they had **lawful access** (e.g., not breaching your site's robots.txt/terms). Many sites ban scraping; if yours did (or you can argue implied license), it's invalid. |\n     - Courts are testing this: In *Getty v Stability AI* (UK High Court, ongoing), scraping billions of images for commercial AI training is challenged as infringement. Your case mirrors it.\n   - **Training use**: Using your work to \"train\" a model that outputs derivatives could infringe your **economic rights** (copying, adaptation). If the model \"memorizes\" Ophelia (common in AI), outputs are infringing copies.\n   - **Jurisdiction**: SDC is US-based, but if their model is accessible/sold in the UK (or targets UK users), UK courts have jurisdiction. You could sue them here.\n\n   **Your angle**: Strong if you prove scraping (e.g., via Wayback Machine screenshots, model outputs mimicking your style/pages). 40 pages is \"substantial\"—not fair dealing.\n\n### 3. **The Ad with Altered Ophelia: Direct Infringement?**\n   - The paying user generated a \"**slightly altered**\" Ophelia and used it in a **national ad** (fizzy drink, commercial). This screams **derivative infringement** (CDPA s.21: adaptation right).\n     - If it's recognizably your character (style, pose, features), it's not \"transformative\" enough to escape. UK courts look at **substantial similarity** (e.g., *Designer Guild v Russell Williams* test).\n     - Crediting the *user* (not you) doesn't help—they're not the owner. The ad's license from SDC doesn't cover *your* underlying IP.\n   - Chain of liability:\n     | Party | Potential Liability |\n     |--------|---------------------|\n     | **SDC** | Primary: Contributory infringement (providing tools trained on your work). Authorisation liability if they knew/should've known. |\n     | **Paying user** | Direct: Made/used infringing copy. Easier target if UK-based. |\n     | **Ad agency/brand** | Secondary: If they knew origin (unlikely), but still liable for using infringing image. |\n   - No \"AI exception\" in UK law yet. Government consultations (2023+) suggest opt-out for TDM, but not law. Outputs aren't automatically \"fair use\" (that's US only).\n\n   **Your angle**: Screenshot the ad, generate similar prompts in their model to prove regurgitation. National ad = big damages potential (lost licensing fees, your rep).\n\n### 4. **Exceptions/Defences They'd Claim (and Why They Might Fail)**\n   - **Fair dealing**: No—ads/training aren't criticism/review/parody/private study.\n   - **Incidental inclusion**: No, deliberate scraping/generation.\n   - **US fair use**: Irrelevant in UK courts.\n   - **Public domain**: Nope, your work is recent/original.\n   - Threshold: Characters like Ophelia may have **independent protection** as artistic works (not just literary).\n\n### 5. **Do You Have a Chance to Fight? Yes—Realistic Shot**\n   - **Strengths**:\n     - Automatic rights + online proof = solid ownership.\n     - 40 pages + specific character = clear infringement evidence.\n     - Commercial harm (your livelihood, fanbase theft).\n     - Precedents building against AI companies (e.g., NY Times v OpenAI suits influencing UK).\n   - **Damages**: Actual (lost sales), account of profits, or statutory (up to £10k+ per work). Injunction to stop model use/sales.\n   - **Weaknesses**: AI novelty means uncertainty; SDC might be deep-pocketed. Proving \"substantial\" scraping if they deleted data.\n   - **Win rate estimate**: 50-70% on derivative (ad), 40-60% on training (per ongoing cases). Better if ad is UK-targeted.\n\n### Next Steps (Act Fast—Limitation: 6 Years)\n1. **Document everything**: Screenshots of your original pages, ad, model outputs (prompt \"Ophelia from Nexus fizzy drink ad\"), timestamps, upload dates.\n2. **Cease & desist (C&D)**: Free template from IPO.gov.uk or solicitor. Email SDC/user/agency demanding takedown, model delisting, damages. Often settles.\n3. **Get help**:\n   - **Free/low-cost**: Intellectual Property Office (IPO) advice line (0300 300 2000), CISAC/COPYRIGHT Hub, or Artists' Union England.\n   - **Solicitor**: £200-500/hr; no-win-no-fee IP firms (e.g., Potter Clarkson, Marks & Clerk). Check Legal Aid if low-income.\n   - **Collective action**: Join class actions like Getty/Stability (UK arm).\n4. **Protect future work**: Add © notice, robots.txt (\"no AI scraping\"), watermark, register with PIC/ACS for evidence.\n5. **Monetise meanwhile**: DMCA takedowns on US platforms, crowdfund legal fight via Patreon (fans love underdogs).\n\nYou *absolutely* have a fighting chance—this is your IP, and UK law backs creators. Don't feel vulnerable; AI companies are on the back foot legally. Hit up a pro today—good luck, and keep creating!
