The candidate answer focuses heavily on the lack of rent payment and the potential status as a licensee/excluded occupier, which relates to the *existence* of a tenancy or proprietary right, not specifically the doctrine of 'actual occupation' as it applies to overriding interests in registered land (which is the typical context where this principle is tested when a property is sold). While actual occupation is relevant if the user had an unregistered interest that could bind the new owner, the answer does not explicitly name or analyze the situation through the lens of 'actual occupation'.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d3fe8fdc-4186-4aac-aa48-c595472e7863\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 827, "completion_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 1006}, "latency_s": 1.2664710409881081, "request_id": "UceUabLmE6X07M8P2KK7sA8", "raw_response": null}
