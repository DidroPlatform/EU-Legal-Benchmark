The candidate answer lists four mechanisms: Penalties for Non-Compliance (which could include fines, but is not explicitly stated as such), Regular Audits, Public Reporting, and Employee Empowerment. While 'Penalties for Non-Compliance' is related to fines, the answer fails to mention specific, strong legal enforcement mechanisms like injunctions or director liability, which are often central to robust compliance frameworks for such regulations.
