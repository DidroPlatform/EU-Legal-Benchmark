Belgium has reported this to a review board, arguing that Spain's refusal to cooperate constitutes an additional violation of the Convention.\n\n### Legal Analysis\n\n#### 1. **Primary Violation: Unmarked Anchored Gear**\n\nThe review board will likely find that Spain violated **Article 5** and **Annex IV, Rule 1** of the Convention.\n\n**Article 5** states: \"Nets, lines and other gear anchored in the sea and nets or lines which drift in the sea shall be marked in order to indicate their position and extent.\"\n\n**Annex IV, Rule 1** provides detailed requirements for marking anchored gear, including:\n- Flag or radar reflector buoys by day and light buoys by night\n- Specific marking requirements for westernmost and easternmost end buoys\n- Lights visible at least 2 miles in good visibility\n\nThe Belgian officers' observation of unmarked anchored lines constitutes a clear violation of these provisions.\n\n#### 2. **Secondary Allegation: Refusal to Cooperate**\n\nRegarding Belgium's argument that the refusal to cooperate constitutes an **additional** violation, the review board will likely find this claim **unsubstantiated** under the Convention.\n\n**Key provisions under Article 9:**\n\n**Article 9(5)** authorizes officers to:\n- Identify the vessel\n- **Seek to obtain** necessary information\n- Report violations\n- Order the vessel to stop if the matter is sufficiently serious\n- Board the vessel if necessary to verify facts\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n\nThe Convention uses permissive language (\"**seek to obtain**\") rather than mandatory language regarding information requests. Notably, the Convention does **not** explicitly impose an obligation on vessel masters or crew to **provide** information or cooperate with foreign authorized officers.\n\n**Article 9(10)** states: \"Resistance by a vessel to the **directions** of an authorised officer shall be deemed as resistance to the authority of the flag State of that vessel.\"\n\nThis provision addresses resistance to **directions** (such as orders to stop), not refusal to provide information voluntarily. The Belgian officers did not report that they ordered the vessel to stop or attempted to board it—they merely requested information.\n\n**Article 9(4)** describes the authorized officers' role as to \"observe,\" \"enquire and report,\" and \"seek information,\" but does not create a corresponding duty on vessels to comply with information requests absent a formal boarding procedure.\n\n### Conclusion and Likely Decision\n\nThe review board will likely conclude:\n\n1. **Spain violated Article 5 and Annex IV, Rule 1** by failing to properly mark anchored fishing gear.\n\n2. **Spain did NOT commit an additional violation** by refusing to provide information to Belgian officers, as:\n   - The Convention does not explicitly require vessels to provide information upon request\n   - The Belgian officers did not exercise their authority to order the vessel to stop or board it\n   - Article 9(10) addresses resistance to \"directions,\" not refusal to answer questions\n   - The refusal to cooperate, while unhelpful, does not constitute a separate breach of Spain's obligations under the Convention\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Acknowledge the primary violation** regarding unmarked gear and take corrective measures to ensure Spanish vessels comply with marking requirements.\n\n2. **Contest the secondary allegation** regarding refusal to cooperate, as it lacks basis in the Convention's text.\n\n3. **Consider implementing internal procedures** to encourage cooperation with authorized officers from other Contracting Parties, even though not legally required, to maintain good relations and facilitate the Convention's objectives.\n\n4. **Prepare evidence** regarding the marking violation for the review board proceedings under Article 7.\n\nPlease contact me if you require further clarification or wish to discuss litigation strategy.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Advisory Counsel]\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer:** This advisory is based solely on the Convention text provided and represents a legal analysis of likely outcomes.
