{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"score\": 0.4, \"pass\": false, \"rationale\": \"The user provided an analysis of five statements (A, B, C, D, E) against a reference answer that only lists A, B, C, and E as correct. The candidate answer evaluates each statement individually, often hedging or finding nuances that lead to a 'partially correct' or 'incorrect' conclusion, even when the reference answer deems the statement correct (e.g., A, C, E).\\n\\nReference Answer states:\\n- A: Correct\\n- B: Correct\\n- C: Correct\\n- D: Incorrect (Implied, as it's missing from the correct list)\\n- E: Correct\\n\\nCandidate Analysis:\\n- A: Tends to be correct, but uncertain without source (Reference says Correct).\\n- B: Correct (Matches Reference).\\n- C: Partially correct facts, legal conclusion only conditionally true (Reference says Correct).\\n- D: Rather incorrect/too general (Matches Reference's implied stance).\\n- E: Partially correct, overall incorrect due to 'against any broadcaster' (Reference says Correct).\\n\\nThe candidate's detailed analysis contradicts the simple binary assessment of the reference answer for A, C, and E. For instance, the reference states A is correct, but the candidate refuses to confirm it as 'empirically proven' without a source, suggesting uncertainty. For E, the reference states it is correct, while the candidate finds the qualifier 'against any' makes it incorrect. Since the task is to judge the statements based on the provided reference answer (which implies A, B, C, E are true statements), the candidate's detailed hedging and outright rejection of E (which the reference accepts) results in a low alignment score.\\n\\nAlignment Score Calculation (based on reference truth values):\\n- A: Reference=True, Candidate=Uncertain/Conditional (Mismatch)\\n- B: Reference=True, Candidate=True (Match)\\n- C: Reference=True, Candidate=Partially True/Conditional (Mismatch)\\n- D: Reference=False, Candidate=False (Match)\\n- E: Reference=True, Candidate=False (Mismatch)\\n\\nOnly 2 out of 5 statements align perfectly with the reference's implied truth value (B and D). Therefore, the score is low.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.4}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2290, "completion_tokens": 509, "total_tokens": 2799}, "latency_s": 1.4600413339794613, "request_id": "ViKVaef2Fv_DnsEPhPSp6QQ", "raw_response": null}
