It addresses the jurisdictional challenge (Article V(1)(a)/(c)) by focusing on the tribunal's competence-competence and the narrow scope of judicial review over the tribunal's jurisdictional findings (Section II). It contrasts this with the public policy/due process challenge (Article V(2)(b)), which relates to the *manner* in which the tribunal exercised its jurisdiction (proceeding despite an injunction), rather than the existence of the underlying jurisdiction itself. The structure implicitly separates the review of the tribunal's decision on jurisdiction (a merits/jurisdictional finding) from the review of whether the *process* violated fundamental fairness.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e92f1752-19b6-4afc-9ea1-4277c9bf6cc0\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3987, "completion_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 4178}, "latency_s": 0.9728266249876469, "request_id": "xL2UaZruJtGxnsEPuvytyAM", "raw_response": null}
