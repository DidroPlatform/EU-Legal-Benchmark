Preliminary Remarks\n\nThis opinion addresses the normative proposition that business's sole social responsibility is profit maximization. The analysis proceeds from Swiss law and comparative legal frameworks. **Key factual material missing:** the specific course curriculum, jurisdiction of application, and whether this concerns private law, constitutional law, or corporate governance.\n\n## II. Disagreement with the Proposition\n\nI respectfully disagree with the absolute formulation presented. Swiss law and modern corporate governance frameworks impose obligations extending beyond profit maximization.\n\n### A. Mandatory Legal Constraints\n\n**1. Constitutional Framework**\n\nSwiss Federal Constitution (SR 101) establishes:\n- Art. 2: State objectives include sustainable development\n- Art. 97: Environmental protection obligations\n- Art. 110: Labor protections\n\nThese constitutional provisions bind private actors indirectly through legislation and judicial interpretation.\n\n**2. Statutory Obligations**\n\nSwiss law imposes mandatory corporate responsibilities:\n\n- **Code of Obligations (CO), Art. 717 et seq.**: Directors must manage company affairs with due diligence and loyalty, not solely for profit maximization\n- **Labor Law (CO, Art. 328 et seq.)**: Mandatory employee protections, safety standards, and working conditions\n- **Environmental Protection Act (SR 814.01)**: Strict liability for environmental damage regardless of profitability\n- **Anti-Corruption Legislation**: Federal Penal Code, Art. 260ter (money laundering) and Art. 102 (bribery)\n\n**3. Corporate Governance Standards**\n\nSwiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance recognizes stakeholder interests beyond shareholders.\n\n### B. Contractual and Fiduciary Limitations\n\n- **Art. 2 CO**: Contracts must not violate public policy (*ordre public*) or good morals (*bonnes mœurs*)\n- Fiduciary duties of management extend to creditors, employees, and the company itself—not exclusively to shareholders\n\n### C. Emerging Legal Developments\n\n- **Due Diligence Obligations**: Federal Act on Due Diligence and Transparency regarding Minerals and Metals from Conflict-Affected Areas (SR 946.231)\n- **Climate Accountability**: Increasing judicial recognition of climate-related corporate duties\n- **Stakeholder Governance**: Growing acceptance of multi-stakeholder models in Swiss corporate law\n\n## III. Theoretical Critique\n\nThe profit-maximization thesis (associated with Friedman, 1970) conflicts with:\n\n1. **Legal pluralism**: Multiple legitimate stakeholder interests\n2. **Externality principle**: Markets fail to price social/environmental costs\n3. **Sustainable development**: Intergenerational equity obligations\n\n## IV. Conclusion\n\n**Swiss law does not recognize profit maximization as the sole corporate responsibility.** Businesses must operate within mandatory legal constraints protecting employees, the environment, creditors, and public order. While shareholder value remains important, it operates within a framework of competing legal obligations and constitutional principles.\n\nThe proposition represents an outdated economic theory incompatible with contemporary Swiss legal architecture.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 154, "completion_tokens": 692, "total_tokens": 846}, "latency_s": 9.960807625000598, "request_id": "chatcmpl-e580a064-24ad-4f77-ba01-7746c138c658", "raw_response": null}
