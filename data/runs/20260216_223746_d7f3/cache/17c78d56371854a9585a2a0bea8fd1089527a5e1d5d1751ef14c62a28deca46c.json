'Methodologically secular' correctly describes an attempt to justify human rights without recourse to religion. This is a standard term in human rights theory. → CORRECT\\n\\nii. The principle of the oldest parentel (parentelic system) means inheritance goes to the closest parentela (group of descendants from a common ancestor). The first parentela consists of the deceased's descendants (children, grandchildren). Only if there are no members of the first parentela does inheritance pass to the second parentela (parents and their descendants). So if the deceased leaves children AND parents, the children inherit, not the parents. The statement says parents are the legal heirs when children exist, which is INCORRECT.\\n\\niii. Human rights can be justified outside Western culture - there are various philosophical traditions (e.g., capabilities approach, cross-cultural justifications) that support human rights beyond Western frameworks. The claim that they cannot be justified outside Western culture is → INCORRECT\\n\\niv. The first part describes the falsa demonstratio/dissent principle correctly - when both interpretations are equally admissible, there is dissent and no contract. The statement then says Swiss contract law is governed by different principles. Under Swiss law (OR Art. 18), the trust principle (Vertrauensprinzip) applies, meaning the objective reasonable interpretation prevails, so a contract can still exist even with diverging subjective intentions. So Swiss law does follow different principles in this regard. This statement appears → CORRECT\\n\\nv. Having a sufficient legal basis is only one requirement of proportionality/lawfulness. Proportionality requires additional analysis (suitability, necessity, proportionality in the narrow sense). A legal basis alone does not make action proportionate. → INCORRECT\\n\\nIncorrect statements: ii, iii, and v → Answer C\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 415, "completion_tokens": 419, "total_tokens": 834}, "latency_s": 10.146731207991252, "request_id": "chatcmpl-09877a02-6a65-48dd-8f58-107c76fc8411", "raw_response": null}
