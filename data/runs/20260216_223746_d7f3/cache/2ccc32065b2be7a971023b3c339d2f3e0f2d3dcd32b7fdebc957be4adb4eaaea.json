Specifically, under Section II.A.2 ('Jurisdictional Objections'), it advises raising objections early under ICC Rules Art. 6(3). Under Section I.B.1, it discusses moving to dismiss in German courts and seeking an anti-suit injunction from English courts, which controls the venue. The entire 'Merits Strategy' section (II.C) is framed offensively, focusing on proving the termination was improper (pretextual grounds) and presenting first on the merits, thereby getting ahead of anticipated counterarguments regarding security vulnerabilities.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b3b4595a-b14f-442f-84fc-b1ac2fc6c311\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2741, "completion_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 2946}, "latency_s": 1.0660620410053525, "request_id": "FtKUabSpGumekdUPuPLrcQ", "raw_response": null}
