The candidate answer discusses the concept of priority based on timing and notice ('If your constructive trust interest arose *before* the lender's charge was registered, there is a strong argument that your interest has priority.') and mentions overriding interests if the beneficiary was in actual occupation. It does not explicitly state the principle that a registered charge against a sole proprietor *cannot* overreach a pre-existing, un-named beneficiary's interest, which is a specific legal concept related to overreaching and the protection of equitable interests when the legal title holder is the only one dealing with the lender. The response focuses more on notice and timing rather than the specific mechanism of overreaching failing to defeat a prior equitable interest.\", \"criterion_id\": \"56903d4e-63dc-4bc3-85b3-6931cd0ed7b8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1842, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 2065}, "latency_s": 0.9358498340006918, "request_id": "iLiUad_AAaOrnsEP8_bgmQE", "raw_response": null}
