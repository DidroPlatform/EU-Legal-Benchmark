USCo can argue that any alleged reputational loss is too remote or not caused by the alleged breach.\\\" It also mentions mitigation. However, it fails to explicitly list the three required elements (foreseeability, non-exclusion by contract, and reasonable certainty) as required by the criterion. It only mentions foreseeability/remoteness, but not the other two specific requirements related to contractual exclusion and certainty of proof.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b891ecd1-29ed-48ab-b657-193a39d276ac\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4298, "completion_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 4522}, "latency_s": 1.151473874982912, "request_id": "LPCUaf5qu9v7xg-zobWBBg", "raw_response": null}
