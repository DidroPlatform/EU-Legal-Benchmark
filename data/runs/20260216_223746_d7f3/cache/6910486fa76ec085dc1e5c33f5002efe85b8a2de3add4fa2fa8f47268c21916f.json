This appears to be accurate - Switzerland did pass such legislation requiring streaming platforms to invest in Swiss film production.\n\n**Statement ii**: About the \"Reinvermögenszugangstheorie\" (net wealth accretion theory). This statement is **correct** - it accurately describes this income theory where income equals all economic goods flowing to a person during a period that can be used without diminishing their wealth.\n\n**Statement iii**: States that cantons have subsidiary general competence for tax collection and can levy all taxes not expressly reserved to the federal government. This is **correct** - this accurately reflects the Swiss federal tax system where cantons have residual tax powers.\n\n**Statement iv**: About occupational pension (berufliche Vorsorge/2nd pillar). The statement says the ESTV (Federal Tax Administration) specifies the principles. This is **false** - it's the BVG (Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors' and Disability Pension Plans) and the supervisory authorities (not ESTV) that define these principles. The ESTV deals with tax aspects, not the fundamental regulatory principles of occupational pensions.\n\nTherefore, statement **iv is false**.\n\n{\"answer\": \"D\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement iv is false because it incorrectly attributes to the ESTV (Federal Tax Administration) the role of specifying fundamental principles of occupational pension schemes, when this is actually the role of pension law (BVG) and pension supervisory authorities, not the tax administration.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 756, "completion_tokens": 377, "total_tokens": 1133}, "latency_s": 8.91826674999902, "request_id": "chatcmpl-bfbbd835-3c58-4e91-9cef-ac9e4e155e4a", "raw_response": null}
