The candidate answer provides a proposed contractual amendment (Section 8) that shifts the responsibility for IOR costs and VAT to the retailer if they refuse the IOR role, but it does not include a specific clause capping the French company's liability to the newly established UK IOR entity (or any other party) at the value of a security deposit. The proposed structure focuses on insulating the French parent via a separate UK subsidiary, not on a liability cap tied to a security deposit.\", \"criterion_id\": \"49d7071d-f6c2-480a-9e08-bbf2ae6219a1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2818, "completion_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 2996}, "latency_s": 0.7741271659906488, "request_id": "HdqUac2PKd_evdIPi9bMuAs", "raw_response": null}
