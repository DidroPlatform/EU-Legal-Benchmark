Section 3 ('What Actually Happens') then details the likely outcome, including the potential for a PE assessment in the Netherlands, which directly supports the premise that the treaty benefit could be denied due to UK PE assertion (via attribution through the transparent CV).\", \"criterion_id\": \"5d6ef8a4-5c02-47c4-af80-dcacf4655e93\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1161, "completion_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 1336}, "latency_s": 1.9183371249819174, "request_id": "q8eUaYKxN5qAkdUP4OXyyQI", "raw_response": null}
