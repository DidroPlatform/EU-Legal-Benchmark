It protects your right to the quiet enjoyment of your land. The leading definition comes from **Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan [1940] AC 880**: an interference with your use or enjoyment of land (or rights over it) that is **substantial** and **unreasonable**.\n\nNoise from a neighbor's band playing loud rock music until 2am twice a week could qualify, especially in a quiet, upscale residential area like South Kensington, where courts expect higher standards of tranquility (see **St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping (1865) 11 HL Cas 642** on locality).\n\n**Note**: This is general information, not legal advice. Consult a solicitor (e.g., via Law Society) or Citizens Advice for your case. You may also have statutory options (see below).\n\n#### What You Need to Show for a Successful Claim\nTo win in court (County Court or High Court), prove on the **balance of probabilities**:\n\n1. **You Have a Protected Interest in Land**:\n   - Ownership or tenancy of your house. As the buyer/owner, you're fine.\n\n2. **Interference with Use/Enjoyment**:\n   - Specific harm: e.g., inability to sleep, relax, or use your garden due to noise. Evidence: Sleep logs, witness statements from family/guests, noise recordings (use a decibel app like Decibel X), GP notes for stress/health impact.\n   - Must be **substantial** (not trivial): Courts dismiss minor annoyances (**Walter v Selfe (1851) 4 De G & Sm 315** – \"something more than mere delicacy or fastidiousness\").\n\n3. **The Interference is Unreasonableness** (Core Test):\n   - Courts balance your rights vs. neighbor's using factors from **Sturges v Bridgman (1879) 11 Ch D 852** and **Miller v Jackson [1977] QB 966**:\n     | Factor                  | How It Applies to Your Case |\n     |-------------------------|-----------------------------|\n     | **Duration & Frequency** | Every Tue/Thu until 2am = regular and prolonged. Strong point. |\n     | **Intensity/Volume**    | \"Loud rock music\" likely exceeds normal levels (e.g., >45-55 dB at night). Measure it. |\n     | **Time of Day**         | 2am in residential area = highly unreasonable (night-time quiet expected). |\n     | **Locality/Character**  | South Kensington: Affluent, residential (not industrial). Courts favor quiet here (**Bamford v Turnley (1862) 3 B&S 66**). |\n     | **Your Sensitivity**    | Can't claim if you're unusually sensitive (e.g., if noise doesn't bother others). |\n     | **Neighbor's Motive**   | Malice (e.g., playing louder to spite you) strengthens your case (**Hollywood Silver Fox Farm v Emmett [1936] 2 KB 468**). |\n     | **Practicality**        | Could they play quieter/shorter? Yes, so unreasonable. |\n   - No need to show damage to property – personal discomfort suffices (**Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd [1997] AC 655**).\n\n4. **Caused by Defendant**:\n   - Your neighbor created/continues it (e.g., hosting the band). They're liable even if band members are guests (**Sedleigh-Denfield**).\n\n5. **No Defence Applies**:\n   - **Coming to the nuisance**: You bought expecting calm, but even if noise predated you, it's no defence if unreasonable (**Miller v Jackson**).\n   - **Prescription**: 20 years continuous nuisance (unlikely if \"started\" recently).\n   - **Statutory authority**: None here.\n\n#### Evidence You'll Need\n- **Logs/Recordings**: Date, time, duration, description, dB levels.\n- **Witnesses**: Neighbors complaining too? Corroborates substantiality.\n- **Expert Report**: Acoustic engineer for noise levels (costly, but persuasive).\n- **Photos/Videos**: Of band setup.\n- **Council Records**: If reported (see below).\n\n#### Remedies if You Win\n- **Injunction**: Court order to stop (primary goal; enforceable with contempt fines/jail).\n- **Damages**: Compensation for past distress/loss (e.g., hotel stays, health costs). Calculated via \"loss of amenity\" (e.g., **Bone v Seale [1975] 1 WLR 797**).\n- Abatement: Self-help rare (e.g., no turning off their power).\n\n#### Steps to Take (Recommended Order)\n1. **Informal**: Politely ask neighbor to stop/reduce (letter/email for record). Suggest soundproofing or earlier finish.\n2. **Local Council (Faster/Cheaper)**: Report as statutory noise nuisance under **Environmental Protection Act 1990 (s.79)**. Council officers measure noise; can issue abatement notice (fines £5k+ if breached). RBKC Environmental Health: Call 020 7361 3000 or online form. Often resolves without court.\n3. **Mediation**: Free via council or service like Mediate UK.\n4. **Civil Claim**:\n   - Pre-action letter (template from Practice Direction Pre-Action Conduct).\n   - Issue claim (£455+ fees; small claims if <£10k).\n   - Time limit: 6 years from nuisance starting.\n5. **Police**: If anti-social (late night), call 101/999, but civil matter primarily.\n\n#### Success Odds\nHigh if noise is as described – courts dislike repeated late-night disturbances in quiet areas (e.g., **Christie v Davey [1893] 1 Ch 316**). But prove unreasonableness; one-off gigs might fail.\n\nCosts: Risky if you lose (loser pays). Consider insurance (legal expenses cover) or no-win-no-fee solicitor.\n\nFor specifics, search \"RBKC noise nuisance\" or contact a property solicitor.
