The candidate answer mentions Liquidation Preference (Point 6 in Section A) and later mentions German drafting cautions, specifically noting that 'Anything resembling a guaranteed repayment/put can run into German capital maintenance constraints; exits are usually handled via drag/tag and sale proceeds, not guaranteed buybacks.' However, it does not explicitly state that the *Liquidation Preference* itself must be structured to avoid conflict with GmbHG §30. It addresses the general concept of guaranteed repayment/put options, which is related but not the specific requirement of structuring the liquidation preference mechanism itself.\",\n  \"criterion_id\": \"c4f96b53-9042-4bb5-a7bc-9375c1bbbac7\"\n}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2912, "completion_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 3119}, "latency_s": 0.7803501669550315, "request_id": "PhuVabn7LeeGkdUPsqK74AQ", "raw_response": null}
