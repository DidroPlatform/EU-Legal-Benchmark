The candidate answer correctly identifies the need for competition filings in Chile but cites 'TDLC (Tribunal de Defensa de la Libre Competencia)' and mentions 'Merger control' generally, without specifically naming or citing Decreto Ley 211. Furthermore, the primary Chilean competition law governing merger control is Law No. 19.994, which established the TDLC, not DL 211, which deals with the creation of the National Economic Prosecutor's Office (Fiscalía Nacional Económica, FNE) and its powers, which were later reformed. Since the specific citation required by the criterion (Decreto Ley 211) is absent, the criterion is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9b7ae9ee-f2cc-4e51-850b-dc8702070b7d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4411, "completion_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 4639}, "latency_s": 1.1355733340024017, "request_id": "jtKUacCuIrK7nsEPp-bmmQI", "raw_response": null}
