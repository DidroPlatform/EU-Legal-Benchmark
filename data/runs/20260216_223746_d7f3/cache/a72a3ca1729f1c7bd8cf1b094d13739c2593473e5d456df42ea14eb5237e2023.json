The candidate answer explicitly concludes the opposite: that the drunk driver's actions *do* break the chain of causation (Novus Actus Interveniens) and therefore the truck driver's causation for the serious injury fails (\\\"Causation **not satisfied** for injury-based charges\\\"). While the candidate correctly identifies the truck driver's negligence, it rejects the premise that liability would follow absent the intervening act being deemed insufficient to break the chain. Therefore, the specific assertion required by the criterion is not met; in fact, the opposite conclusion is reached.\", \"criterion_id\": \"13ad59d3-0614-44b5-9ff4-b6db76ef2755\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1723, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 1933}, "latency_s": 26.368121500010602, "request_id": "lDGVaZ-sLPujkdUP0fjD0QU", "raw_response": null}
