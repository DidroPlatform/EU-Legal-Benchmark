Preliminary Remarks and Applicable Regulatory Framework\n\n### 1. Identification of Applicable Takeover Regime\n\nA plc is incorporated in the United Kingdom and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The question of which takeover regime applies is determined primarily by the jurisdiction of incorporation and the market on which the target's securities are admitted to trading.\n\nUnder the **UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers** (\"the Code\"), the Code applies to offers for companies which have their registered offices in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man, if any of their securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the United Kingdom or on any stock exchange in those jurisdictions (see **Introduction to the Code, Section 3(a)(i)**). A plc, being incorporated in the UK and listed on the London Stock Exchange, falls squarely within the scope of the Code.\n\nThe **Takeover Panel** is the competent supervisory authority.\n\n### 2. Inapplicability of Swiss Takeover Law\n\nSince A plc is neither incorporated in Switzerland nor listed on a Swiss trading venue (SIX Swiss Exchange or BX Swiss), the Swiss Federal Act on Financial Market Infrastructures and Market Conduct in Securities and Derivatives Trading (FinfraG, SR 958.1) and the corresponding Takeover Ordinance (UEV, SR 954.195.1) are **not applicable**. The Swiss Takeover Board (Übernahmekommission) has no jurisdiction. Even if B AG were a Swiss company (the question states B AG is German), the decisive connecting factor under most takeover regimes is the target's jurisdiction, not the bidder's.\n\n**Note:** The question does not specify whether B AG has any Swiss nexus. If B AG were listed in Switzerland, certain Swiss disclosure obligations might arise in relation to B AG's own shareholders, but this does not affect the takeover regime applicable to A plc.\n\n---\n\n## II. Consequences under the UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers\n\n### 1. Mandatory Bid Obligation (Rule 9 of the Code)\n\n#### a) Triggering Threshold\n\n**Rule 9.1(a)** of the Code provides that any person who acquires, whether by a series of transactions over a period of time or not, an interest in shares which (taken together with shares in which persons acting in concert with him are interested) carry **30 % or more** of the voting rights of a company, is normally required to make a **mandatory general offer** to all remaining shareholders.\n\n**Rule 9.1(b)** further provides that any person who, together with persons acting in concert with him, is interested in shares carrying not less than 30 % but not more than 50 % of the voting rights and who acquires additional shares increasing his percentage is also obliged to make a mandatory offer.\n\nB AG has acquired **40 %** of A plc's voting capital and voting rights. This exceeds the 30 % threshold. Consequently, **B AG is obliged to make a mandatory cash offer (or with a cash alternative) to all remaining holders of A plc shares** under Rule 9.\n\n#### b) Terms of the Mandatory Offer\n\nUnder **Rule 9.5**, the offer must be in **cash or accompanied by a cash alternative** at not less than the **highest price** paid by the offeror (or any person acting in concert with it) for interests in shares of the relevant class during the **12 months prior** to the announcement of the offer.\n\nThe offer must be for **all outstanding shares** of A plc not already held by B AG (Rule 9.1).\n\n#### c) Conditionality\n\nUnder **Rule 9.3**, a mandatory offer under Rule 9 may only be conditional upon the offeror receiving acceptances resulting in the offeror holding shares carrying **more than 50 %** of the voting rights. No other conditions (e.g., material adverse change, due diligence) are permitted for a mandatory offer, unlike a voluntary offer.\n\n### 2. Disclosure Obligations\n\n#### a) Under the Code\n\n**Rule 8** of the Code imposes **disclosure obligations** on dealings in relevant securities during an offer period. B AG and any persons acting in concert must disclose dealings promptly (by 12:00 noon on the business day following the dealing) to the Takeover Panel and to a Regulatory Information Service.\n\n#### b) Under the UK Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR 5)\n\nThe **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** administers the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR). Under **DTR 5.1.2R**, a person must notify the issuer and the FCA of the percentage of voting rights held when the percentage reaches, exceeds, or falls below certain thresholds: **3 %, 4 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, 30 %, 50 %, and 75 %**.\n\nB AG, having acquired 40 %, will have crossed multiple thresholds (3 %, 4 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, 30 %) and must have made the corresponding notifications. The notification must be made **as soon as possible, and no later than two trading days** after the person learns of the acquisition (DTR 5.8.3R).\n\nFailure to comply with DTR 5 may result in **suspension of voting rights** and FCA enforcement action.\n\n### 3. Offer Documentation and Timetable\n\nUnder **Rule 24** of the Code, B AG must send an **offer document** to A plc shareholders within **28 days** of the announcement of the offer. The offer document must contain the prescribed information set out in Rule 24.3 (including terms, conditions, financing, intentions regarding the target's business, employees, etc.).\n\nUnder **Rule 31**, the offer must initially remain open for at least **21 days** from the date of posting of the offer document.\n\n### 4. Financing Confirmation (Rule 2.7 and Rule 9)\n\nUnder **Rule 2.7(a)**, the announcement of a firm intention to make an offer must include confirmation by the offeror's financial adviser that **sufficient resources are available** to satisfy full acceptance of the offer. This \"cash confirmation\" requirement is of particular importance in a mandatory offer under Rule 9, where the offer must be in cash or include a cash alternative.\n\n### 5. Consequences of Non-Compliance with Rule 9\n\nIf B AG fails to make the mandatory offer, the Takeover Panel may:\n\n- **Require divestiture** of shares to below 30 %;\n- **Suspend voting rights** attached to the shares exceeding the threshold;\n- Issue **public censure**;\n- Apply to the **court** for enforcement under the Companies Act 2006, **ss. 955–956**, which give statutory backing to the Panel's rulings.\n\n### 6. Squeeze-Out and Sell-Out Rights\n\nShould B AG ultimately acquire **90 % or more** of the shares to which the offer relates, it may exercise a **compulsory acquisition (squeeze-out)** right under **ss. 979–982 of the Companies Act 2006**. Conversely, remaining minority shareholders have a **sell-out right** under **ss. 983–985 Companies Act 2006**.\n\n---\n\n## III. EU/German Regulatory Considerations for B AG\n\n### 1. German/EU Merger Control\n\nDepending on the turnover thresholds, the acquisition may trigger **EU merger control** under the **EU Merger Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 139/2004)** if the relevant turnover thresholds in Art. 1 Abs. 2 or Abs. 3 are met. Alternatively, German national merger control under **§§ 35 ff. GWB** (Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen) may apply. UK merger control under the **Enterprise Act 2002** may also be relevant (the CMA having jurisdiction post-Brexit).\n\n### 2. Foreign Direct Investment Screening\n\nPost-Brexit, the UK **National Security and Investment Act 2021** may apply if A plc operates in a sensitive sector, potentially requiring notification to the UK Secretary of State.\n\n---\n\n## IV. Missing Factual Information\n\nFor a complete analysis, the following information would be required:\n\n1. **Whether B AG is acting in concert** with any other persons (relevant for aggregation under Rule 9 and DTR 5);\n2. **The price and timeline** of B AG's acquisitions (relevant for determining the mandatory offer price under Rule 9.5);\n3. **Whether B AG has already made the required DTR 5 notifications** at each threshold crossing;\n4. **The sector in which A plc operates** (relevant for foreign investment screening and merger control);\n5. **The turnover figures** of both A plc and B AG (relevant for merger control thresholds);\n6. **Whether any dispensation from the mandatory bid obligation** has been sought from or granted by the Takeover Panel (e.g., under Note 1 on the Dispensations from Rule 9).\n\n---\n\n## V. Conclusion\n\nThe acquisition by B AG of 40 % of A plc's voting rights triggers the **mandatory bid obligation under Rule 9 of the UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers**. B AG must make a general cash offer to all remaining shareholders at not less than the highest price paid in the preceding 12 months. Extensive **disclosure obligations** under DTR 5 and Rule 8 of the Code apply. Non-compliance exposes B AG to enforcement action by the Takeover Panel and the FCA, including potential divestiture orders and suspension of voting rights. Additionally, **merger control** and **foreign investment screening** requirements may apply depending on the specific circumstances.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 175, "completion_tokens": 2299, "total_tokens": 2474}, "latency_s": 47.61521166699822, "request_id": "chatcmpl-01ca263f-f7e9-4875-aa1f-13748b938e0f", "raw_response": null}
