The candidate answer correctly describes the situation *under the Windsor Framework* (WF), stating that under the Green Lane, goods are 'presumed not \\\"at risk\\\" unless evidence suggests otherwise' and that the burden shifts to the EU. This directly contradicts the premise of the criterion, which relates to the *original Protocol's* presumption regarding 'at risk' status, which was generally that goods moving into NI were presumed 'at risk' unless specific derogations were met or the importer could prove they were staying in NI. The candidate focuses entirely on the WF changes, not the initial Protocol status as required by the criterion's focus.\", \"criterion_id\": \"61afe06c-4c7c-460c-8a2e-3ba3157cf84e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2976, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 3190}, "latency_s": 0.9107296249712817, "request_id": "VgGVab6BFdnn7M8P8fieuAs", "raw_response": null}
