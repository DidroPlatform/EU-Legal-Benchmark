Spanish officers on board refused to cooperate. Belgium has reported this incident to a review board, arguing that Spain violated its Convention obligations by refusing cooperation.\n\n**LEGAL ANALYSIS**\n\n**1. Spain's Obligation to Cooperate**\n\nArticle 9(4) of the Convention establishes that authorized officers shall \"seek information in cases of damage, where desirable draw the attention of vessels of Contracting Parties to the provisions of the Convention, and shall co-operate for these purposes with the authorised officers of other Contracting Parties.\"\n\nMore critically, Article 9(5) provides that when an authorized officer has reason to believe a vessel is not complying with Convention provisions, the officer \"may identify the vessel, seek to obtain the necessary information from the vessel and report.\"\n\n**2. The Refusal to Cooperate as a Violation**\n\nArticle 9(10) contains the decisive provision: \"Resistance by a vessel to the directions of an authorised officer shall be deemed as resistance to the authority of the flag State of that vessel.\"\n\nThe Spanish officers' refusal to cooperate with the Belgian officers' request for information constitutes \"resistance\" to the authorized officer's lawful exercise of powers under Article 9(5). This resistance is expressly deemed to be resistance to Spain's own authority.\n\n**3. Spain's Substantive Obligations**\n\nArticle 5 requires that \"nets, lines and other gear anchored in the sea...shall be marked in order to indicate their position and extent\" in accordance with Annex IV. The unmarked lines identified by Belgian officers appear to constitute a prima facie violation of this requirement.\n\nArticle 8(1) obligates each Contracting Party to \"take such measures as may be appropriate to implement and enforce the provisions of this Convention with respect to its vessels and gear.\"\n\n**LIKELY REVIEW BOARD DECISION**\n\nThe review board will likely find that:\n\n1. **The initial violation existed**: The unmarked anchored lines violated Article 5 and Annex IV requirements.\n\n2. **Spain violated Article 9(10)**: By refusing to cooperate with the Belgian authorized officers' lawful request for information, Spanish officers resisted the directions of an authorized officer, which constitutes resistance to Spain's own flag State authority.\n\n3. **Spain breached Article 8(1)**: Spain failed to ensure compliance with Convention provisions by refusing to cooperate with enforcement efforts.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION**\n\nSpain should prepare to acknowledge that the refusal to cooperate constituted a violation of Article 9(10) of the Convention. We recommend:\n\n- Issuing internal directives to Spanish fishing vessel operators requiring full cooperation with authorized officers from other Contracting Parties\n- Conducting an investigation into the unmarked gear incident\n- Considering disciplinary measures against the Spanish vessel operators involved\n- Submitting a compliance statement to the review board\n\nThis proactive approach will demonstrate Spain's commitment to Convention obligations and mitigate potential further proceedings.\n\n---", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 13449, "completion_tokens": 793, "total_tokens": 14242}, "latency_s": 9.14302183300606, "request_id": "chatcmpl-731851fa-1738-4037-ba5c-e6efefa0b5d1", "raw_response": null}
