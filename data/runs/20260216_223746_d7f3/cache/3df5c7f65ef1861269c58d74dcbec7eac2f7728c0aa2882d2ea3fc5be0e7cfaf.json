The response suggests setting up a UK Subsidiary to act as the IOR, which implies the French company acts as the supplier under EXW, but it never explicitly states that the French company *cannot* legally act as the EU Exporter under EXW terms for customs purposes (which is generally true when the final destination is the UK and the French entity lacks the necessary UK customs registration/liability structure). Instead, it focuses on how to structure the liability away from the French parent, which is an operational solution, not a direct legal statement addressing the impossibility of the French entity acting as the EU Exporter in this specific UK import scenario.\", \"criterion_id\": \"cf77364d-885c-4118-9665-e75f304c088a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2819, "completion_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 3026}, "latency_s": 0.8631796249828767, "request_id": "CdqUafLBMJXvvdIP-N6pkAE", "raw_response": null}
