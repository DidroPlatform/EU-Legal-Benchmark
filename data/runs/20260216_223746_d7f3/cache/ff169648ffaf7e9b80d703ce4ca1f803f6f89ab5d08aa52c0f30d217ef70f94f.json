Since A plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange, the Takeover Code is applicable.\n\n2. **Mandatory Bid Rule**:\n   Under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code, if a person acquires shares carrying 30% or more of the voting rights of a company, they are generally required to make a mandatory offer to all other shareholders to acquire their shares at a fair price. Since B AG has acquired 40% of the voting capital and voting rights, this threshold is exceeded, triggering the mandatory bid requirement.\n\n3. **Consequences of Triggering the Mandatory Bid Rule**:\n   - B AG would be required to make an offer to all remaining shareholders of A plc to acquire their shares.\n   - The offer must be made at a fair price, which is typically the highest price paid by the offeror during the 12 months prior to the offer.\n   - The offer document must be sent to all shareholders, and the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers must be notified.\n\n4. **Related Securities Regulations**:\n   - Under the UK Companies Act 2006, specifically Section 793, any person who acquires an interest in shares that results in them holding 3% or more of the voting rights must notify the company.\n   - Additionally, the UK Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) would apply to ensure that the market is not misled and that insider dealing and market manipulation are prevented.\n\nIn conclusion, B AG's acquisition of 40% of the voting capital and voting rights of A plc would trigger the mandatory bid rule under the UK Takeover Code, requiring B AG to make an offer to all remaining shareholders at a fair price. Additionally, disclosure requirements under the UK Companies Act 2006 and the UK Market Abuse Regulation would apply.\n\nIf the intention was to discuss the scenario under Swiss law, please clarify, as the current scenario involves UK and German companies and would be governed primarily by UK law.\n\nHowever, if we were to consider a hypothetical scenario under Swiss law, the acquisition of a significant percentage of voting rights in a Swiss-listed company would be governed by the Swiss Financial Market Infrastructure Act (FinfraG) and the regulations of the Swiss Takeover Board. Under Swiss law, the threshold for a mandatory offer is generally 33% of the voting rights (Art. 135 FinfraG). But since the scenario involves UK and German companies, this is not directly applicable.\n\nGiven the context, the answer is based on UK law.\n\n---\n\nPlease clarify if you intended to ask about Swiss law or if you require further details on UK law.\n\nFor now, the consequences under UK law are as follows:\n\nUnder the UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, the acquisition by B AG of 40% of the voting capital and voting rights of A plc would trigger the mandatory bid rule. B AG would be required to make an offer to all remaining shareholders of A plc to acquire their shares at a fair price.
