we're just making the mechanics clear\"*\n\n## **TIER 2: HIGHLY IMPORTANT (Push hard, but negotiable)**\n\n### 5. **Drag-Along Rights (Mitveräußerungspflicht)**\n- Requires 75% shareholder approval to force a sale\n- Only triggered for offers above certain valuation threshold (e.g., 2x current round)\n- Includes employee shareholders\n\n**German law/market justification:**\n- Prevents small shareholders (employees with 15%) from blocking value-creating exits\n- § 34 BGB (freedom of contract) allows this\n- Standard in German growth equity deals\n- Frame it as: *\"This prevents a situation where 5% employee shareholders block an exit that 85% of shareholders want\"*\n- **Compromise position:** Set high threshold (80% approval + minimum return multiple)\n\n### 6. **Liquidation Preference (Liquidationspräferenz)**\n- 1x non-participating preference (you get your money back first, then participate pro-rata)\n- Applies to liquidation, sale, or deemed liquidation events\n\n**German law/market justification:**\n- Standard in 90%+ of German Series A deals\n- Reflects that you're paying fair market value while founders got shares at formation cost\n- § 72 GmbHG allows contractual priority in distributions\n- Frame it as: *\"We're investing €X million at a €Y valuation; this simply ensures we recover our investment before profit-sharing if things don't go as planned\"*\n- **Compromise position:** 1x non-participating (not participating) - this is founder-friendly\n\n### 7. **Anti-Dilution Protection**\n- Weighted-average anti-dilution (NOT full ratchet)\n- Only applies to down rounds, not all issuances\n\n**German law/market justification:**\n- Weighted-average is the founder-friendly version (full ratchet would be harsh)\n- Standard in German VC deals\n- Protects against dilution if company raises next round at lower valuation\n- Frame it as: *\"This only matters if the next round is a down round, and it uses the fair weighted-average method\"*\n\n## **TIER 3: NICE TO HAVE (Request but be ready to drop)**\n\n### 8. **Board Representation or Observer Rights**\n- Given GmbH structure, this likely means Beirat (advisory board) seat or observer rights\n\n**Justification:**\n- Standard for investors of your size\n- Helps you add value, not just monitor\n- **Compromise:** Accept observer rights instead of voting seat\n\n### 9. **Founder Vesting (Reverse Vesting)**\n- 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff on founder shares\n- Only applies to shares going forward (not already earned)\n\n**Justification:**\n- Standard in US/UK, increasingly common in Germany\n- Protects all shareholders if founder leaves early\n- **Compromise:** Apply only to portion of founder shares (e.g., 25% of their holdings), or use \"good leaver/bad leaver\" provisions instead\n\n### 10. **ROFR/ROFO on Founder Sales**\n- Company (then investors) get right of first refusal if founders want to sell\n\n**Justification:**\n- Allows company to control cap table\n- **Compromise:** Only applies to sales above certain threshold (e.g., >5% of shares)\n\n## **TIER 4: DROP THESE TO BUILD GOODWILL**\n\n- Pay-to-play provisions (too aggressive for Series A)\n- Redemption rights (founders will hate this)\n- Full ratchet anti-dilution (too harsh)\n- Participating liquidation preference (too aggressive)\n- Extensive non-competes beyond what's already in employment contracts\n- Board control (unrealistic at 25%)\n\n## **NEGOTIATION STRATEGY**\n\n### **Opening Position:**\nPresent Tier 1 + Tier 2 provisions as your \"standard term sheet\" based on market practice.\n\n### **Concessions to Offer:**\n1. **Liquidation preference:** Emphasize 1x non-participating (not participating)\n2. **Drag-along threshold:** Increase from 75% to 80% approval requirement\n3. **Vesting:** Offer to apply only to portion of shares or use leaver provisions\n4. **Board seat:** Accept observer rights instead\n5. **Anti-dilution:** Emphasize weighted-average (not full ratchet)\n\n### **Key Framing Messages:**\n\n**\"Market Standard\" Approach:**\n- *\"These terms reflect standard German Series A practice. We've based this on GVCA guidelines and our experience with [X] other German investments.\"*\n- Cite specific comparable deals if possible (anonymized)\n\n**\"Mutual Protection\" Approach:**\n- *\"Many of these provisions protect all shareholders, not just us. For example, veto rights on new share issuances prevent anyone from being diluted unfairly.\"*\n\n**\"Future Funding\" Approach:**\n- *\"If you want to raise Series B from top-tier VCs, they'll expect to see these protections already in place. We're helping you build an institutional-grade structure.\"*\n\n**\"Alignment\" Approach:**\n- *\"These terms ensure we're all aligned toward the same exit. Tag-along and drag-along rights mean we all succeed together.\"*\n\n### **German Law Specific Points:**\n\n1. **GmbH vs. AG structure:** Confirm whether conversion to AG is contemplated for exit (this affects some provisions)\n\n2. **Notarization requirements:** All SHA amendments and share transfers require notarization (§ 15 GmbHG) - build in process and cost expectations\n\n3. **Geschäftsführer authority:** Clarify which decisions require shareholder approval vs. managing director authority\n\n4. **Works Council:** If company has >5 employees, works council may have co-determination rights on certain matters\n\n## **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**\n\n**Phase 1 - Term Sheet:**\n- Include Tier 1 + Tier 2 provisions\n- Frame as \"market standard Series A terms\"\n- Be prepared to explain each provision's purpose\n\n**Phase 2 - Negotiation:**\n- Defend Tier 1 as non-negotiable\n- Show flexibility on Tier 2 thresholds and mechanics\n- Offer Tier 3 as \"nice to have\"\n- Explicitly drop Tier 4 items to show reasonableness\n\n**Phase 3 - Documentation:**\n- Keep SHA under 30 pages if possible\n- Use clear, plain language (German or English with German translation)\n- Include definitions section to avoid ambiguity\n- Consider separate side letters for complex provisions\n\n## **RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR**\n\nIf founders resist Tier 1 provisions (especially tag-along and basic veto rights), this suggests:\n- Lack of experience with institutional investors\n- Possible misalignment on exit expectations\n- Need for education on market standards\n\nConsider bringing in German VC lawyer to explain market norms in founder meeting.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Your Tier 1 provisions are genuinely non-negotiable for a minority institutional investor. Tier 2 provisions are standard but have room for compromise on thresholds and mechanics. This approach protects your downside while maintaining a collaborative relationship with founders who control 60%.\n\nWould you like me to draft specific language for any of these provisions, or discuss how to handle specific founder objections?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 129, "completion_tokens": 2311, "total_tokens": 2440}, "latency_s": 44.09075870900415, "request_id": "chatcmpl-ac06883b-dc8d-4fd2-bbb9-a675b1098990", "raw_response": null}
