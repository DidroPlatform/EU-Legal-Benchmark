It analyzes the tax consequences of each, which inherently involves considering the flexibility to switch between or combine these approaches (e.g., the discussion of debt conversion options, hybrid mismatch rules, and the comparison between immediate U.S. interest inclusion vs. Section 245A dividend inclusion). Furthermore, the analysis of funding via a U.S. parent versus a sister subsidiary (Ireland) introduces a modular entity design choice, effectively presenting a second major structural flexibility point beyond the initial equity vs. debt choice. The response addresses the comparative implications of these different structural paths.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5338ade1-d4a6-44bc-b8f6-9728ea8a5fc1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2294, "completion_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 2482}, "latency_s": 1.9259479999891482, "request_id": "_SCVaZ7CL9WbkdUPueCoyAM", "raw_response": null}
