It also correctly mentions the requirement for an 'equitable price' (referred to as 'fair price'). Furthermore, it correctly identifies related securities regulations, specifically disclosure requirements (citing the Companies Act 2006 and MAR). \\n\\nThe reference answer focuses on the EU Takeover Directive (which is less relevant post-Brexit, although the UK Code is derived from it) and mentions 'control' and 'equitable price' in the context of Member States' definitions. The candidate answer is more precise by directly citing the relevant UK rule (Rule 9, 30% threshold) and the relevant UK legislation (Companies Act 2006, MAR).\\n\\nThe candidate answer's repeated self-correction/clarification regarding Swiss law is extraneous but does not detract from the core legal analysis based on the facts provided (UK company). The core analysis is strong and directly addresses the prompt using the correct jurisdiction's rules.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.85}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3192, "completion_tokens": 287, "total_tokens": 3479}, "latency_s": 1.3045850000344217, "request_id": "uROVaYz6AvWNxs0Pm9-XoQg", "raw_response": null}
