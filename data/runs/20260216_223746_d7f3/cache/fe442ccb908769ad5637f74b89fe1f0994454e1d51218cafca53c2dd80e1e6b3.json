This directly satisfies the criterion that the response states the green lane includes no customs duties and fewer physical checks on goods. While the response correctly notes that 'no customs duties' is not strictly accurate for all goods (as it depends on the final destination and tariff differential), it accurately describes the *intent* and *effect* of the Green Lane as having 'greatly reduced checks' compared to the Red Lane, which aligns with the spirit of the criterion regarding fewer physical checks.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2e6ff7fe-ebef-4ddf-9cc8-6e9d270e8344\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4082, "completion_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 4273}, "latency_s": 0.7978054159902968, "request_id": "pyCVadLSK9qgkdUPg_fLkAM", "raw_response": null}
