I'll outline the key issues.\n\n## Your Strongest Potential Argument: Adverse Possession (\"Squatter's Rights\")\n\nAfter **10 years of continuous occupation**, you may have a claim, but the legal framework differs depending on whether the land is registered or unregistered:\n\n- **Registered land** (most London property): Under the Land Registration Act 2002, you can apply after **10 years**, but the registered owner gets a chance to object and has 2 years to take action to evict you\n- **Unregistered land**: Under the Limitation Act 1980, the period is **12 years**, so you would not yet qualify\n\n**Key requirements** for adverse possession:\n- **Factual possession** – exclusive physical control of the property\n- **Intention to possess** – treating it as your own\n- **Without consent** – this is critical (see below)\n\n## Significant Problems With Your Position\n\n### 1. The \"Without Consent\" Issue\nYou describe a **landlord** – this language implies you had permission to be there. If you were given licence or consent to occupy, even without paying rent, this likely defeats an adverse possession claim. The clock may never have started running.\n\n### 2. The Absence from the Property\nYour **6-month absence** in Asia is potentially very damaging:\n- Adverse possession requires **continuous** possession\n- A prolonged absence could be argued to have **broken the continuity** of your occupation\n- The fact that belongings remained may not be sufficient to maintain possession\n\n### 3. The Ignored Text Message\nThis is concerning for a different reason:\n- The buyer specifically asked if you were still living there\n- Your **silence** could be viewed as deliberately misleading\n- This could raise issues of **estoppel** – if the buyer purchased partly relying on the impression you had vacated, you may be prevented from now asserting rights\n- It could also be seen as evidence that you **knew** your claim was weak\n\n### 4. New Purchaser's Position\n- A buyer of registered land generally takes the property subject to interests that are **protected by registration** or constitute **overriding interests**\n- A person in **actual occupation** at the time of purchase may have an overriding interest under **Schedule 3, Paragraph 2 of the LRA 2002**\n- However, you were arguably **not in actual occupation** at the time of purchase – you were in Asia\n- Even if your belongings were there, case law (e.g., **Stockholm Finance v Garden Holdings**) suggests physical presence matters\n\n## What the New Owner Can Do\n\nIf you have no legal protection, the new owner could:\n- Seek a **possession order** through the courts\n- They **cannot** use force or change locks while you are present (Protection from Eviction Act 1977)\n- Even trespassers are entitled to a **court process**\n\n## What You Should Do\n\n**Urgently consult a solicitor** experienced in:\n- Adverse possession claims\n- Occupiers' rights\n- Property litigation\n\nKey facts that will determine your position:\n- Was the land **registered or unregistered**?\n- What was the **exact nature** of your arrangement with the original landlord – was there any agreement, even informal?\n- Can you demonstrate **continuous intention to possess** during your absence?\n- What exactly did the buyer know and when?\n\n## Honest Assessment\n\nYour position has **significant weaknesses**:\n- The relationship with the \"landlord\" may imply consent\n- The 6-month absence undermines both adverse possession and overriding interest arguments\n- The ignored message could work against you\n\nThat said, 10 years of occupation is substantial, and there may be arguments available depending on the precise facts. **Do not leave the property without legal advice**, but equally, do not assume you have a strong claim.\n\n> **This is not legal advice** – the factual nuances here are critical, and you need a qualified solicitor to assess your specific circumstances properly.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 159, "completion_tokens": 932, "total_tokens": 1091}, "latency_s": 25.40497824997874, "request_id": "chatcmpl-d3d2f4a3-fc0d-4c4b-90f9-5e03602cc310", "raw_response": null}
