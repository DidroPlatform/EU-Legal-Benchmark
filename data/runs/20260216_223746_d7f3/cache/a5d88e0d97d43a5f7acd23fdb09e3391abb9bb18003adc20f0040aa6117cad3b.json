The response states that the contract *must* state the retail price or a formula to calculate it (Art. L.132-6 CPI), and that the author has leverage to negotiate this price or formula. It also mentions the author can legally challenge a price that is 'manifestly too low' (Art. L.132-9 CPI) and negotiate 'prior written approval for any change' (Art. L.132-7). While the author has significant input and veto power over changes, the law (Art. L.132-6) mandates that the contract specifies the price, which is *negotiated* between the parties, not unilaterally set or fixed by the author as a legal default. The author's power is based on negotiation and contractual clauses, not a statutory right to unilaterally set or approve the final retail price as the default legal position.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a4b9ac1f-ad65-4795-8621-04e72c36c1f3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1757, "completion_tokens": 260, "total_tokens": 2017}, "latency_s": 1.0020518749952316, "request_id": "HiSVabROx4Lszw_-29GQCw", "raw_response": null}
