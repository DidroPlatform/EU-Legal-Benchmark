The reasoning provided directly aligns with the criterion's components: framing the issue as a breach of contract (wrongful termination under Delaware law, Section II.A), controlling timing (filing the counterclaim immediately, Section III.A), presenting first to avoid being defensive (filing a counterclaim, Section III.A), and preventing German court litigation (by seeking an anti-suit injunction in England, Section I.B and III.A).
