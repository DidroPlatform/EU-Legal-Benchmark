While the answer discusses the *possibility* of the buyer acting as IOR under EXW, it frames this as a non-starter given the current situation, and does not affirmatively state that the retailer *can* act as IOR in a way that solves the user's problem; rather, it focuses on how to avoid that scenario.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b95ec896-bf99-44a0-bde1-07de5ee914e5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2963, "completion_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 3158}, "latency_s": 1.049279166967608, "request_id": "mhiVaYnvLYuX28oPlq_ciQw", "raw_response": null}
