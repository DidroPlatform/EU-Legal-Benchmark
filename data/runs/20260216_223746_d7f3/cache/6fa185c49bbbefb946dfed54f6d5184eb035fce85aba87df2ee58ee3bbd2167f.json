Specifically, under section E, it states: 'Italy (implementing EU law) recognizes certain exceptions/limitations, including caricature, parody, and pastiche (EU InfoSoc/DSM framework).' It then applies this to the examples, noting that the 'warped version mocking a famous joke' might be argued as parody.
