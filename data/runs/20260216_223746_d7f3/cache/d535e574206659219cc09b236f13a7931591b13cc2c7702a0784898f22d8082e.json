Procedures can vary by local court (Tribunale), and rules may update. Your friend should consult a lawyer, notary, or the local Ufficio del Giudice Tutelare for personalized advice. They can also check the Ministry of Justice website or local services.\n\n### What is Amministrazione di Sostegno (AdS)?\nAdS is a flexible form of legal protection for adults (usually elderly or ill) who can't fully manage their personal or financial affairs due to physical/mental limitations, but who don't need full \"interdizione\" (total incapacity). It's less invasive than traditional guardianship, tailored to the person's needs (e.g., help with bills vs. full asset control). The goal is to support autonomy while protecting interests.\n\n### How the Court Decides to Grant AdS\nThe process starts with a **petition (ricorso)** filed at the **Giudice Tutelare** (Tutelage Judge) of the Tribunal in the beneficiary's residence municipality. Who can file:\n- The person themselves (beneficiary).\n- Spouse/partner, relatives (up to 4th degree), guardians, public prosecutor, or local social services/municipality.\n\n**Steps in the decision process**:\n1. **Filing and initial review**: Judge checks if petition meets basics (e.g., evidence of need).\n2. **Hearing**: Mandatory private hearing with beneficiary (unless impossible). Judge assesses capacity via interview. May involve:\n   - Family/relatives consultation.\n   - Medical expert (CTU - Consulenza Tecnica d'Ufficio) for diagnosis.\n   - Social worker report on living conditions.\n3. **Decree (decreto)**: Issued within ~60 days (often faster). Judge decides:\n   - If AdS is needed and its extent (e.g., only for finances/healthcare).\n   - Appoints guardian (preferably a close relative; if none suitable, a professional or public administrator).\n   - Specifies powers (e.g., sign contracts, manage bank accounts).\n4. **Appeal**: Possible within 30 days.\n5. **Duration**: Indefinite or time-limited; reviewed periodically.\n\nCourt grants if there's **proven inability** to handle affairs independently, prioritizing beneficiary's will and minimal intervention.\n\n### Documents Usually Needed\nSubmit originals + copies to the Tribunal (some via PEC email or online portal). Common list:\n- **Petition form** (modulo di ricorso - downloadable from Tribunal sites or Ministero della Giustizia).\n- **Beneficiary's ID** (carta d'identità/passport) + tax code (codice fiscale).\n- **Medical certificates**: From GP/specialist (neurologist/psychiatrist) describing condition (e.g., dementia, illness). Include ASL (local health authority) report if possible.\n- **Family documents**: Birth/marriage certificates, family status certificate (stato di famiglia), IDs of petitioner/relatives.\n- **Residence proof** (certificato di residenza).\n- **Financial overview** (optional but helpful: bank statements, property deeds).\n- **Consent declarations** from relatives (if applicable).\n- Power of attorney if lawyer assists.\n\nFees: Minimal (~€100-200 court stamps + lawyer if used). Free for low-income via \"patrocinio a spese dello Stato\".\n\n### Responsibilities of the Guardian (Amministratore di Sostegno)\nDefined in the judge's decree. Guardian acts as \"assistant/protector\" in beneficiary's **best interest**, with fiduciary duty. Key duties:\n- **Personal care**: Healthcare decisions, living arrangements, daily support (as specified).\n- **Financial management**: Pay bills, manage income/pensions, investments, property sales (needs judge approval for big acts).\n- **Legal representation**: Sign contracts, deal with banks/authorities, tax filings.\n- **Reporting**: Annual account (rendiconto) to judge on actions/money. Can be audited.\n- **Limits**: Can't act against beneficiary's will unless incapable; no self-dealing.\n- **Compensation**: Usually voluntary/unpaid for relatives; pros get fee (~€500-2000/year based on complexity).\n- **Removal**: If mismanaging, judge can revoke.\n\nGuardian must swear oath before judge and get official role confirmation.\n\n### Next Steps for Your Friend\n- Contact local **Tribunale** (e.g., search \"Giudice Tutelare [city]\") for forms/guides.\n- Free help: Municipality social services (Servizi Sociali), ASL, or associations like Auser/Volontariato.\n- Lawyer/notary: Recommended for complex cases (e.g., assets abroad).\n- Timeline: 1-3 months typically.\n\nThis protects the elderly parent while respecting dignity.
