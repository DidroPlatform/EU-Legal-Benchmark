The candidate answer discusses parody extensively under US law, noting that parody must borrow from the original to make its point and that its success depends on whether it is transformative (Campbell v. Acuff-Rose). However, the candidate answer *never* contrasts parody and satire in the specific manner required by the criterion (i.e., explaining that parody transforms the work while satire only changes the context). It only mentions satire implicitly when discussing the political shirt (Shirt 2) as potentially being commentary, but it does not define or contrast the two concepts as requested by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c11709a9-5dda-48c9-ac5e-05eb4cb06143\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4294, "completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 4496}, "latency_s": 1.1908233750145882, "request_id": "NMaUaaX5DfX6nsEP2_KP8AI", "raw_response": null}
