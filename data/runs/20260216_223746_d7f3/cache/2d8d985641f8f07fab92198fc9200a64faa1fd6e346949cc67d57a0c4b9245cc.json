The candidate answer explicitly mentions 'Data-gaming: Firms may re-classify job titles or shift workers to “non-core” categories to hide gaps' under 'Unintended Consequences' (Section 1.1, point 5), which aligns with statistical masking/data manipulation. Furthermore, in Section 2.2, point 5, it mentions preventing 'gap-masking (e.g., a small gender gap that hides a large racial gap)' as a benefit of intersectional data requirements, implying masking is a resistance tactic. While 'outsourcing' is not explicitly named, 'Data-gaming' and the concept of 'gap-masking' through data manipulation satisfy the requirement for identifying mechanisms of resistance related to statistical manipulation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"226d3d3f-71b5-4749-82f1-943ef9515f6e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4474, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 4697}, "latency_s": 1.3200642089941539, "request_id": "afGUaeONL9qfnsEPvPyNyAM", "raw_response": null}
