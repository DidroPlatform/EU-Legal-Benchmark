The candidate answer addresses this under 'Pre-Emptive Strikes' in Section 2.B, stating: 'A defendant does not have to wait to be struck first if they genuinely believe an attack is imminent (R v Beckford [1988] AC 130). However, retaliation or revenge will not suffice (R v Rashford [2005] EWCA Crim 3377).' Furthermore, Section 4.A.2 confirms the client acted when he 'perceived an imminent threat.' This directly addresses the requirement that the force must be used to avert an imminent or immediately apprehended attack, which is a key requirement of self-defence.\", \"criterion_id\": \"74ca3b09-c13e-4143-b0da-ede48e93caee\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4165, "completion_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 4382}, "latency_s": 0.7347762919962406, "request_id": "KPeUafjKGPnOnsEPkprNkQM", "raw_response": null}
