The candidate answer explicitly addresses this influence, stating: 'The arbitration clause doesn\\u2019t oust jurisdiction\\u2014but it shapes discretion' and later, 'The arbitration clause does not oust the court\\u2019s power, but it strongly influences discretion: the court will tailor or refuse relief unless it is necessary, proportionate, and supportive of (not intrusive into) the arbitral process...'. While the answer focuses heavily on the *seat* and the *arbitration agreement* itself (s.44 AA 1996), the balancing act described inherently involves considering the context of the contract, which includes governing law, when assessing necessity and effectiveness (e.g., comparing English relief to potential Singapore relief). More directly, the discussion of how the court balances comity and the seat against English relief (Section 3) is the practical application of how the contractual framework (which includes governing law) shapes discretion. The answer clearly addresses the influence on discretion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8b9ea1c1-5d76-4999-98af-31210a326714\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1662, "completion_tokens": 285, "total_tokens": 1947}, "latency_s": 44.17404766700929, "request_id": "_RmVaereOaeN7M8P6NXVwQY", "raw_response": null}
