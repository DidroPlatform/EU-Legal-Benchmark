The candidate answer mentions this in Section 4.3 (\\\"Protection from Eviction Act 1977 \\u2013 unlawful eviction or harassment is a civil claim for damages and an injunction\\\") and again in Section 5 (\\\"Damages for wrongful eviction / harassment \\u2013 Landlord evicts or harasses you in breach of the Protection from Eviction Act 1977\\\"). However, the criterion asks if the model explicitly states the tenant *may sue* the landlord for harassment under that Act. While it states it is a 'civil claim for damages and an injunction' and that the tenant can 'claim statutory damages', it does not use the exact phrasing 'sue the landlord for harassment under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977'. Given the strict nature of the evaluation, this slight deviation means the criterion is not explicitly met as phrased.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a2e5d5e5-8a15-4744-8d30-bd34cbeab07c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4050, "completion_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 4315}, "latency_s": 1.9792528329999186, "request_id": "iO6Uae3IBM-zxN8PisHh-AM", "raw_response": null}
