The candidate answer discusses the pitfalls of relying on an incomplete FRA (Section 1, row b, 'Disadvantages / pitfalls') and notes that if the FRA omits PAT testing, the owner 'may be deemed to have failed to identify a significant risk.' It also mentions over-reliance on the assessor as delegating statutory duty (Section 2, 'Third-party fire-risk assessment' disadvantage). However, it does not explicitly state the legal principle that the *owner/RP* retains the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the FRA is 'sufficient and suitable' despite paying a third party to complete it, which is the core assertion of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"96af97b1-4044-42bb-9b71-15102a04a27e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4345, "completion_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 4562}, "latency_s": 0.9491140419850126, "request_id": "_euUaba-AueGkdUPsqK74AQ", "raw_response": null}
