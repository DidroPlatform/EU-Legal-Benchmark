The candidate answer discusses discovery conflicts extensively, specifically mentioning the conflict between US discovery demands and UK/German rules (e.g., UK's limited disclosure under CPR 31 and Germany's lack of party-driven discovery). It cites the Hague Evidence Convention and mentions blocking statutes (UK's Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 and Germany's \\u00a7271 StGB). However, it frames the uncertainty primarily as a conflict between US discovery demands and European blocking statutes/rules, rather than explicitly stating the 'enforceability of US discovery orders in the EU' as the key uncertainty, although this is strongly implied by the discussion of conflicts and the Hague Convention. Since the specific phrasing required by the criterion is not explicitly stated, and the focus is more on the conflict/sanctions risk arising from the attempt to enforce, the criterion is not clearly and directly satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3e986a45-fd40-4d19-9122-1432a8a5e47d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4300, "completion_tokens": 267, "total_tokens": 4567}, "latency_s": 1.230788582994137, "request_id": "bsqUaZ3RO4qB7M8P4pHemAI", "raw_response": null}
