This is covered in Section 5.4, where it discusses the burden of proof and the two-lane system, implying that goods staying in NI or being re-exported to the EU (which includes processing) are treated differently from those going to GB. Specifically, Section 5.3 states: 'The green lane... Goods intended to stay in NI (or to be re-exported to the EU)'. Furthermore, Section 2 states NI must adhere to EU product rules, which inherently covers processing standards for goods staying in NI but destined for the EU market. The explanation of the two-lane system (Green vs Red) directly relates to the final destination, which includes onward movement into the EU market after processing in NI.\", \"criterion_id\": \"fc71b680-fd6e-4d06-9a32-d540462c9927\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3958, "completion_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 4194}, "latency_s": 41.015524375019595, "request_id": "-vGUaYOTHNrbxs0P1qTOyAQ", "raw_response": null}
