The candidate answer mentions the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 in the context of claiming damages in a civil court ('Harassment? If they've bullied/threatened, claim under Protection from Eviction Act 1977 (court order + damages)'). It also mentions unlawful eviction under the Deregulation Act 2015 in the context of damages. While these Acts relate to illegal actions by a landlord, the answer frames the consequences primarily in terms of civil remedies (damages, costs, counterclaims) rather than explicitly stating that the landlord could face *criminal charges* under these statutes. It mentions 'criminal charges' are not applicable in the civil context ('English courts don't treat civil claims like criminal \\\"wrongful accusations\\\"'), but fails to list two specific offenses that *could* lead to criminal charges if proven, as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ea1a9a8b-7d7c-44c1-8ced-c217d5f70a0c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1717, "completion_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 1992}, "latency_s": 1.1689262500149198, "request_id": "SSyVabH6KpnqkdUP3rjkuQo", "raw_response": null}
