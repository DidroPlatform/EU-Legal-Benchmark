It’s designed to be **tailor‑made and as non‑restrictive as possible**, unlike full *interdizione* (now rare).\n\nBelow is a practical overview of **(1) how the court decides**, **(2) typical documents**, and **(3) the administrator’s responsibilities**. (This is general information; for a specific case it’s wise to consult a local lawyer or a patronato.)\n\n---\n\n## 1) How the court decides whether to grant AdS\n\n### Who decides and where\nThe decision is made by the **Giudice Tutelare** (Guardianship Judge) at the **Tribunale** of the person’s **residenza o domicilio** (the person to be protected, called the *beneficiario*).\n\n### The legal test the judge applies\nThe judge grants AdS when the person has a **partial or total inability**, even if temporary, to provide for their own interests because of:\n- **physical or mental infirmity**, or\n- **impairment/decline** (e.g., dementia, neurological disease, severe frailty)\n\nThe key is not the diagnosis alone, but whether the condition **actually affects decision‑making and day‑to‑day management** (money, healthcare decisions, contracts, dealing with public offices, etc.).\n\n### What the judge evaluates in practice\nThe court typically looks at:\n\n1. **Medical evidence of incapacity/decline**  \n   Documentation showing cognitive/functional impairment and its impact.\n\n2. **Concrete needs and risks**  \n   For example: unpaid bills, vulnerability to scams, inability to consent to care, difficulties managing pensions/bank accounts, property issues.\n\n3. **Proportionality (least restrictive measure)**  \n   AdS can be limited to specific acts (e.g., only bank transactions over a threshold, selling property, accepting inheritance), leaving the person autonomy for everything else. The judge will shape the decree accordingly.\n\n4. **The proposed administrator’s suitability**  \n   Relationship to the beneficiary, reliability, absence of conflict of interest, ability to manage paperwork/finances.  \n   Usually a close family member is appointed, but the judge can appoint a **professional** (lawyer/accountant) if there’s conflict, complexity, or no suitable relatives.\n\n5. **The beneficiary’s views**  \n   The judge usually **hears the beneficiary** (often at home/hospital if needed) unless it would be impossible or harmful. The beneficiary’s preferences matter, including about who should be appointed.\n\n### Typical outcome: a tailored “decreto”\nIf granted, the judge issues a **decree** specifying:\n- who the **amministratore di sostegno** is\n- the **duration** (often indefinite, but can be time‑limited)\n- which acts the administrator can do **on behalf of** the beneficiary\n- which acts require **prior authorization** from the judge\n- reporting requirements (inventory, annual accountings, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## 2) Documents usually needed (typical checklist)\n\nRequirements vary slightly by court, but commonly include:\n\n### Personal/civil status documents\n- **Identity documents** and **codice fiscale** of:\n  - the beneficiary\n  - the applicant (often the future administrator)\n- **Certificate of residence** (*certificato di residenza*) of the beneficiary\n- **Stato di famiglia** (family status certificate)\n- If relevant: marriage certificate, documentation of kinship, etc.\n\n### Medical documentation (very important)\n- A **recent medical certificate/report** describing:\n  - diagnosis/condition (e.g., Alzheimer’s, vascular dementia, Parkinson’s with cognitive impairment)\n  - functional limitations\n  - impact on ability to manage personal/financial affairs\n  - whether the person can attend a hearing / be interviewed\n- Often helpful: specialist reports (neurologist/geriatrician), cognitive test results, discharge summaries.\n\n### Financial/property snapshot (often requested/strongly recommended)\nNot always mandatory at filing, but frequently requested by the judge:\n- pension/income information (INPS statements)\n- bank/post office accounts (IBANs, approximate balances)\n- property titles (real estate, land registry references)\n- bills/expenses (caregiver, nursing home, utilities)\n- debts/loans\n- any ongoing legal disputes\n- insurance policies, investments\n\n### The petition/filing itself\n- A **ricorso per amministazione di sostegno** stating:\n  - why protection is needed\n  - what acts the administrator should be empowered to do\n  - the proposed administrator’s details and reasons they’re suitable\n  - contact details of close relatives (the court often notifies/hears them)\n\n### Other potentially relevant documents\n- Any existing **power of attorney (procura)**, prior court measures, or social services reports\n- If the beneficiary has expressed preferences earlier (letters, etc.), those can help\n- Declarations about absence of conflicts of interest can be useful\n\nPractical note: many people file with the support of a **lawyer**, but in many situations AdS petitions are filed without one; local court practice varies.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Responsibilities and duties of the amministatore di sostegno\n\nThe administrator’s powers are **only those written in the decree**. In general, responsibilities fall into these areas:\n\n### A) Acting in the beneficiary’s interest (core duty)\n- The administrator must act **exclusively for the beneficiary’s benefit**, respecting their dignity and wishes.\n- The goal is to **support**, not replace, the person whenever they can still decide.\n\n### B) Managing finances and administration (common tasks)\nDepending on the decree, the administrator may:\n- collect income (pension, benefits)\n- pay routine expenses (utilities, rent, care costs)\n- manage bank accounts\n- apply for benefits/services (INPS, disability measures, municipal services)\n- handle tax filings or engage professionals when needed\n\nOften the judge distinguishes:\n- **ordinary administration** (routine payments/management), usually allowed\n- **extraordinary acts**, often requiring **prior court authorization**\n\n### C) Healthcare and care decisions (if included)\nIf the decree gives this role, the administrator may:\n- interface with doctors/hospitals\n- give or refuse consent for treatments **within the limits of the decree and health law**\n- arrange home care, caregivers, or nursing home placement\n\nImportant: healthcare decision-making can be sensitive; the judge may specify what the administrator can do, and the beneficiary’s wishes remain central.\n\n### D) Court authorizations for extraordinary acts (very common)\nTypical acts that often require authorization include:\n- selling or mortgaging real estate\n- accepting or renouncing an inheritance; property divisions\n- large withdrawals or investments\n- settlements in lawsuits\n- donations/gifts\n- signing long-term contracts with significant financial impact\n\nIf the administrator acts beyond their powers or without required authorization, the act can be challenged and the administrator can be removed.\n\n### E) Reporting duties (accountability)\nCommon obligations:\n- **Initial inventory** (*inventario*) of assets shortly after appointment (timing set by the judge)\n- **Periodic reporting/accounting** (*rendiconto*)—often annually—showing:\n  - income received\n  - expenses paid\n  - current asset situation\n  - major decisions made\n- Keeping receipts and documentation.\n\n### F) Respecting the beneficiary’s autonomy and personal life\nThe administrator should:\n- consult the beneficiary as much as possible\n- keep family relationships in mind (without letting family interests override the beneficiary’s)\n- avoid unnecessary restrictions.\n\n### G) Limits, compensation, and liability\n- Compensation: many family administrators do it **without pay**, but the judge can allow reimbursement of expenses and sometimes a fee depending on circumstances.\n- Liability: the administrator can be held responsible for **mismanagement**, conflicts of interest, or negligence, and may be removed.\n\n---\n\n## What your friend can do now (practical prep)\n- Obtain a **recent, detailed medical report** addressing functional capacity.\n- Prepare a clear list of the **practical problems** that AdS would solve (bank, bills, care decisions).\n- Gather a **basic asset/income overview** and recurring expenses.\n- Consider any **family conflicts** early; if present, the court may want additional safeguards.\n\nIf you tell me **the region/city (Tribunale)** and whether the parent is still able to be interviewed and express preferences, I can outline what the process timeline typically looks like and what courts in practice often ask for.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 68, "completion_tokens": 1798, "total_tokens": 1866}, "latency_s": 38.4125018340128, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJ05C2M5AVWG4M36F3Z3MB", "raw_response": null}
