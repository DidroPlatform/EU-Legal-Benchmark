{"provider": "vercel_gateway", "model": "vercel_ai_gateway/openai/gpt-5.2", "text": "In France, collecting information about people’s ability to practice sports can fall under **personal data** rules, and sometimes even **health data** rules, depending on how the question was asked and what it reveals. In most cases, you don’t need to “declare” it to an authority anymore, but you **do** have legal information duties toward the members and you must handle the data properly.\n\n## 1) Do you need to inform an authority (CNIL)?\n**Usually no.** Since the GDPR (RGPD), most processing is **not subject to prior notification/registration** with CNIL. Instead, the association must be able to **demonstrate compliance** (accountability).\n\nExceptions exist (rare for small associations): e.g., some high-risk processing requiring a **DPIA/AIPD**, or if you appoint a DPO (not mandatory for most small associations), etc.\n\n## 2) Do you need to inform the members?\n**Yes.** Even for a simple form, you must provide an **information notice** at the time of collection (or before), including:\n- who is collecting the data (the association + contact)\n- purposes (planning activities, ensuring suitable activities)\n- legal basis (often **consent** or **legitimate interest**, but see health data below)\n- recipients (who in the association can access it; any external partners)\n- retention period (how long you keep the forms)\n- members’ rights (access, rectification, deletion, objection, restriction, etc.) and how to exercise them\n- if data is mandatory/optional and consequences of not answering\n\nThis can be done **on the form itself**, a short paper notice, or a link/QR code to a privacy notice.\n\n## 3) Is “able/unable to practice sports” considered health data?\nIt depends on the wording and level of detail:\n\n- If your form asked something like **“Can you do running / cycling / swimming?”** and the answer is just about preferences/ability in a general sense, it may be treated as **standard personal data**.\n- But if “unable” implicitly indicates a **medical condition, disability, injury, contraindication**, or if you asked **why** (e.g., asthma, heart issue, pregnancy, disability), then it’s likely **health data** under GDPR (special category data), which triggers **stricter rules**.\n\nGiven your association’s goal (“visibility to medical prevention”), CNIL could view the context as health-adjacent. If the form can reveal health limitations, it’s safer to treat it as potentially **sensitive**.\n\n## 4) If it is (or could be) health data, what changes?\nTo process health data, you generally need:\n- **Explicit consent** from the person (clear affirmative statement; ideally a checkbox + wording), unless a narrow exception applies.\nAnd you should apply stronger safeguards:\n- limit access (need-to-know)\n- minimize data (only what you truly need)\n- short retention\n- secure storage (no open spreadsheets shared widely, etc.)\n\n## 5) Practical answer for your situation\n- You **probably did not need to notify CNIL**.\n- You **should have informed members** (privacy notice) regardless.\n- If the questionnaire could reveal health limitations, you **should also have collected explicit consent** and applied enhanced safeguards.\n\n## 6) What you can do now (remediation)\n1. **Map what you collected** (exact questions + data format + who accessed it).\n2. **Add a privacy notice** for future collections (and consider sending it to members now).\n3. If health-related: **update the form** to (a) avoid collecting reasons, or (b) add an **explicit consent checkbox**.\n4. Set a **retention rule** (e.g., delete after the season/planning period).\n5. Ensure **basic security** (restricted access, locked files, no broad sharing).\n\nIf you paste (or summarize) the exact questions you asked and whether you asked for reasons/medical details, I can tell you more precisely whether it likely qualifies as health data and what the most appropriate legal basis/notice wording would be.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 90, "completion_tokens": 863, "total_tokens": 953}, "latency_s": 21.759454792016186, "request_id": "gen_01KHNHZEYD5R271FRC0253BZMA", "raw_response": null}
