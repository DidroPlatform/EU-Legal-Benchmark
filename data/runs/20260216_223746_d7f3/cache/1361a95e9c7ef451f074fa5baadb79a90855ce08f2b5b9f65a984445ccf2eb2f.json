The candidate answer discusses moral rights (paternity right, right to object to derogatory treatment, right to object to false attribution) but does not explicitly link the breach of the *right to be identified* (paternity right) specifically to the act of commercial publication/exhibition by the advertiser, as required by the criterion's specific framing regarding when the breach *occurs* in relation to the advertiser's action. It correctly identifies the ad as infringing moral rights (no credit given) but fails to articulate the specific legal condition mentioned in the criterion regarding when the breach is deemed to occur in relation to the commercial exhibitor.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c7044567-39eb-4f9b-b0f9-1e689184f731\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2589, "completion_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 2815}, "latency_s": 0.8248495410080068, "request_id": "j_yUaZCPAcyynsEPyd_uiAQ", "raw_response": null}
