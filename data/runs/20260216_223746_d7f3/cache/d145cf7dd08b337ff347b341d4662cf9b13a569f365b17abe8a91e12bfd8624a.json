The candidate answer discusses the conflict between US (California) expansive discovery and German limited discovery (ZPO §142) and the risk of documents subject to German privilege (Anwaltsprivileg) being disclosed in the UK. It proposes mitigation strategies like protective orders and sequencing. However, it does not explicitly state the *uncertainty* regarding the *enforceability* of US discovery orders (specifically, whether a US subpoena/order compelling production would be recognized or enforced by German courts) as a key coordination uncertainty. While the conflict in discovery scope is detailed, the specific legal uncertainty about enforcing US discovery mechanisms in Germany/EU is not directly articulated as the required key uncertainty.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3e986a45-fd40-4d19-9122-1432a8a5e47d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4091, "completion_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 4310}, "latency_s": 0.9575608329905663, "request_id": "MtmUaaXJN8KHnsEPkpLbwQ8", "raw_response": null}
