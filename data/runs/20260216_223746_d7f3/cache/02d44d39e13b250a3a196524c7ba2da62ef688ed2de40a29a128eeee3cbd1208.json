The response mentions the tenant's obligations (like paying rent on time, which the user stated they did) and lists potential landlord breaches (failing to carry out repairs, unlawful entry) and grounds for a Section 8 notice (Rent Arrears/ Breach of Tenancy). However, it does not explicitly list two distinct types of *tenant* breaches that the landlord might be accusing the tenant of, which is the context implied by the user's statement that they believe they did nothing wrong. The response focuses on what the tenant should prove regarding their compliance, not on listing two distinct types of breaches the tenant might have committed. While it mentions 'Rent Arrears' as a ground for a Section 8 notice, it doesn't pair it with another distinct breach type the tenant might have committed.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8a3d1e61-d07b-42b4-9e15-bf239c2edd27\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2035, "completion_tokens": 244, "total_tokens": 2279}, "latency_s": 1.1451515840017237, "request_id": "Gv6UaY-XE-OkkdUPvpSE8Qg", "raw_response": null}
