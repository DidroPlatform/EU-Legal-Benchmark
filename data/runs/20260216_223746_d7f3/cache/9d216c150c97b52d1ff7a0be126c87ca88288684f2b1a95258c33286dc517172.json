The candidate response provides KPIs with targets (e.g., target: 0, target: 100%) and specifies reporting cadences, including exception reporting timelines (e.g., \\\"exception reporting within 10 business days of any breach\\\"). However, it does not explicitly define the *materiality thresholds or tolerances* that would trigger the escalation/remediation for most KPIs, nor does it consistently define the *remediation timelines* for breaches, beyond the reporting cadence itself. For example, for Control 1.1, it states a target of 0 breaches, but doesn't define what level of breach (if any) is considered material enough to trigger a specific remediation timeline beyond the 10-day reporting requirement. The response offers to provide this in a follow-up step (\\\"If you answer those, I\\u2019ll convert this into an audit-committee-ready control matrix... with explicit thresholds\\\"), but the current answer does not fully meet the strict requirement of specifying these elements for *every* control point.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c81f11b1-1de7-4a08-9bea-c09bd530c8ac\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3735, "completion_tokens": 298, "total_tokens": 4033}, "latency_s": 1.167735625000205, "request_id": "1h-VacunBqzd7M8PoNSSsQM", "raw_response": null}
