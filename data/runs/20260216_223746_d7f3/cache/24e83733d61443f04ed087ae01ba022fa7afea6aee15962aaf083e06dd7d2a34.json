The candidate answer discusses intervening causes (the truck driver's negligence and the second driver's actions) but never mentions the visibility or conspicuousness of the chair as a factor in assessing the *reasonableness* of the drunk driver's reaction or whether the chain of causation was broken by the driver's reaction to the obstacle.
