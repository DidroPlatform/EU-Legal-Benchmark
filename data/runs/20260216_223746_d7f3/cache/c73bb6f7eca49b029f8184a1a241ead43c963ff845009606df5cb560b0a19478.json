More importantly, the context of the question implies the user *assumes* EU protection from an Italian filing, and the answer correctly pivots to discussing EUTM vs. national filings. While it doesn't explicitly state the UK is outside the EUIPO in the section discussing the UK filing, the overall context of trademark law implies this separation, and the candidate correctly handles the distinction between EU protection and UK protection when advising on the next filing step. However, to strictly meet the criterion, the response should have explicitly mentioned the UK's non-EUIPO status, especially since the user is asking about EU protection.\", \"criterion_id\": \"17b8861c-da76-4241-ac65-efe3f8145e1e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1566, "completion_tokens": 244, "total_tokens": 1810}, "latency_s": 1.0907175419852138, "request_id": "eA-VadT-B5_UxN8P5b7YuQc", "raw_response": null}
