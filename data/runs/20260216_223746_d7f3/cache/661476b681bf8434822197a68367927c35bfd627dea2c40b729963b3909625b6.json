{"provider": "nim", "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", "text": " Here is a strategic framework for defending enforcement in the Southern District of New York (or the Second Circuit), structured around the specific defenses raised (lack of jurisdiction and due process) and the complicating factor of the anti-suit injunction.\n\n### I. Core Defensive Arguments\n\n#### A. **Competence-Competenz and Deference to the Tribunal’s Jurisdictional Determination**\nThe US supplier’s jurisdictional challenge will likely fail because US courts apply a **highly deferential standard** to arbitral jurisdictional rulings.\n\n*   **Primary Authority**: Cite *Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc.*, 139 S. Ct. 524 (2019). The Supreme Court held that courts must enforce the parties’ delegation of arbitrability questions to the tribunal, even if the claim is “wholly groundless.” This extends to the tribunal’s decision to proceed despite parallel litigation or injunctions.\n*   **Standard of Review**: Under *First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan*, 514 U.S. 938 (1995), courts review arbitral jurisdictional findings with deference, applying a “clearly erroneous” or “manifest disregard” standard (depending on the circuit) rather than *de novo* review.\n*   **French Law Controls**: Because the seat is Paris, French procedural law (Art. 1462 of the French Code of Civil Procedure) governs the conduct of the arbitration. French courts do not recognize foreign anti-suit injunctions as valid obstacles to arbitration; they view such injunctions as violations of French *ordre public international*. Since the tribunal acted within its statutory authority under the law of the seat, its jurisdictional determination is entitled to substantial weight.\n\n#### B. **No Violation of Due Process (Article V(1)(b))**\nThe supplier’s claim that proceeding “despite the injunction” violated due process is likely to conflate **notice** with **strategic choice**.\n\n*   **The “Notice and Opportunity” Test**: Article V(1)(b) requires only that the party was “able to present his case.” If the supplier received notice of the hearings under the ICC Rules (or UNCITRAL/Ad hoc rules) and chose not to participate *because* of its own injunction strategy, this constitutes a **self-inflicted inability to present its case**.\n*   **Precedent**: In *Spier v. Calzaturificio Tecnica, S.p.A.*, 663 F. Supp. 165 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), aff’d, 847 F.2d 90 (2d Cir. 1988), the court enforced an award where the defendant refused to participate in the arbitration after filing a competing Italian action. The court held that a party cannot manufacture a due process violation by boycotting proceedings it had notice of.\n*   **Argument**: The supplier could have (and likely did) brief jurisdictional objections before the Paris tribunal. Its decision to seek injunctive relief in the US rather than defend on the merits in Paris was a procedural election that does not retroactively invalidate the tribunal’s authority or the fairness of the proceeding.\n\n#### C. **The Anti-Suit Injunction Does Not Create an Article V Defense**\nThis is your most critical argument. The supplier will argue that the injunction rendered the tribunal’s conduct a violation of US procedural public policy or that the award is not “binding” under Article V(1)(e).\n\n*   **Comity and the “Binding” Nature**: Under Article V(1)(e), an award is unenforceable only if it has been “set aside or suspended” by a competent authority of the country of origin (France). A US anti-suit injunction does **not** render an award non-binding; only the French courts can vacate it. If the supplier has not (or cannot) obtain annulment in Paris, the award remains binding for US enforcement purposes.\n*   **Public Policy Exception is Narrow**: Cite *China Minmetals Materials Import and Export Co. v. Fuka Co.*, 334 F.3d 274 (2d Cir. 2003). The Second Circuit construes Article V(2)(b)’s public policy defense extremely narrowly, limited to “fundamental notions of what is decent and just in the United States.” The US public policy *favors* international arbitration (*Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.*, 473 U.S. 614 (1985)). A technical contempt of a US court’s anti-suit order (which may itself have been an improper exercise of jurisdiction over a foreign arbitration) does not rise to a violation of fundamental US public policy.\n*   **The “Improper Remedy” Argument**: The supplier’s remedy for the tribunal’s contempt of the injunction was to seek sanctions or recognition of the injunction in France (where it likely would have failed). By rendering an award, the tribunal did not create a jurisdictional defect; it created a contempt issue that is separate from the Convention’s enforcement criteria.\n\n### II. Key Precedents and Scholarly Authority\n\n**On Deference in Overlapping Jurisdictions:**\n*   **BG Group plc v. Republic of Argentina**, 572 U.S. 25 (2014): The Court emphasized that procedural decisions (including whether to proceed in the face of local court orders) are for the tribunal, subject only to deferential review.\n*   **Seetransport Wiking Trader Schiffarhtsgesellschaft MBH & Co. v. Navimpex Centrala Navala**, 29 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 1994): While not involving an injunction, the Second Circuit emphasized that US courts should not second-guess procedural rulings of international tribunals seated abroad.\n*   **Gau Shan Co. v. Bankers Trust Co.**, 956 F.2d 1349 (5th Cir. 1992): Discusses the comity concerns that make US courts reluctant to enjoin foreign proceedings, implying that tribunals are not bound by such orders.\n\n**On French Law and Anti-Suit Injunctions:**\n*   **Société National Industrielle Aérospatiale v. US District Court** (comity principles): While this case allows for anti-suit injunctions in exceptional circumstances, its balancing test (degree of interference with US proceedings vs. foreign sovereignty) actually supports the argument that enjoining a Paris-seated arbitration is an excessive interference with French sovereignty.\n*   French Court of Cassation, Civ. 1ère, 14 Oct. 2003 (No. 01-13.042): French courts treat foreign anti-suit injunctions directed at arbitration as unenforceable and contrary to French international public policy.\n\n**Scholarly Positions:**\n*   **Gary Born**, *International Commercial Arbitration* (3d ed.): Argues that the *competence-competence* principle requires that courts give preclusive effect to arbitral jurisdictional rulings unless they are “manifestly invalid” under the law of the seat.\n*   **Emmanuel Gaillard**, *Legal Theory of International Arbitration* (2016): Posits that the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction is “transnational” and not dependent on the permission of any national court; thus, proceeding despite an injunction is an exercise of autonomous jurisdictional authority that enforcing courts should respect.\n*   **Frédéric Bachand**, “The Relationship Between Arbitral Tribunals and National Courts with Concurrent Jurisdiction” in *Enforcement of Arbitration Agreements* (Van den Berg ed.): Argues that enforcing awards rendered in defiance of anti-suit injunctions reinforces the integrity of the international arbitral system and discourages improper forum shopping through injunctive relief.\n\n### III. Tactical Recommendations\n\n1.  **Preemptive Strike on the “Binding” Issue**: File a declaration from French counsel confirming that under French law, the anti-suit injunction is *inopposable* (unenforceable) and that the award is final and binding under Art. 1518 of the French CCP (which governs the *exequatur* of awards). If the supplier has not sought annulment in Paris (and the 1-month/3-month window has passed), argue they are procedurally barred from relitigating jurisdiction in the US.\n2.  **Characterize the Injunction as a “Procedural Gambit”**: Argue that the supplier sought the injunction not to preserve a legitimate jurisdictional objection, but to “torpedo” the arbitration. US courts disfavor such “guerilla tactics” (*Laker Airways Ltd. v. Sabena, Belgian World Airlines*).\n3.  **Separation of Powers**: Emphasize that the tribunal’s decision to proceed is an act of a private adjudicatory body operating under French law, not a “contempt” of US judicial authority that taints the award’s validity. The remedy for contempt (if any) lies against the parties or counsel, not against the validity of the award itself.\n\n**Conclusion**: The Second Circuit’s strong pro-enforcement bias, combined with the deferential standards of *Henry Schein* and *BG Group*, makes the award highly defensible. The supplier’s proper course was to challenge jurisdiction *before the tribunal* and seek annulment *in France*, not to collaterally attack the award in New York based on an injunction that the tribunal was not bound to obey.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 120, "completion_tokens": 4823, "total_tokens": 4943}, "latency_s": 150.52199862498674, "request_id": "chatcmpl-8bdc816969886775", "raw_response": null}
