Here's what you need to know:\n\n## Legal Framework\n\n**GIPs have flexibility in employment regimes:**\n- GIPs can employ staff under **private law contracts** (CDI/CDD)\n- They can also employ **public law agents** (fonctionnaires détachés, contractuels de droit public)\n- The choice depends on the **GIP's statutes** and founding documents\n\n## Key Considerations\n\n### 1. **Check Your GIP's Statutes**\nYour GIP's constitutive agreement (*convention constitutive*) should specify:\n- Which employment regime(s) are authorized\n- Any restrictions or requirements\n- Default regime if not specified\n\n### 2. **Nature of Activities**\n- Contributing to public service missions does **NOT automatically require** public law status\n- Private law employment is valid even for core public service functions in a GIP context\n\n### 3. **Practical Implications**\n**Private law regime means:**\n- Labor Code (*Code du travail*) applies\n- Employment tribunals (*Prud'hommes*) have jurisdiction\n- Standard private sector protections and procedures\n\n## Important Caveat\n\n⚠️ **You must verify your specific GIP's legal framework**, as some GIPs may have statutory restrictions requiring certain positions to be filled under public law.\n\n**Recommendation:** Review your convention constitutive or consult your legal counsel to confirm the authorized employment regimes for your particular GIP.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 57, "completion_tokens": 368, "total_tokens": 425}, "latency_s": 8.626392207981553, "request_id": "chatcmpl-f3683454-9f73-40cb-8e68-0a5b4c12f823", "raw_response": null}
