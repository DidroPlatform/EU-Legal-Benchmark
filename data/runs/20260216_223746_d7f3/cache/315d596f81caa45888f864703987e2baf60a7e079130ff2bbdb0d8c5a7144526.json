{"provider": "bedrock", "model": "bedrock/converse/openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0", "text": "**TL;DR** – You *do* have copyright (and moral‑right) protection in the UK even though you never “registered” anything.  Synthetic Dreams’ scraping of your publicly posted pages and the use of the resulting AI‑generated images in a commercial ad are very likely to be copyright infringements (and breaches of your moral‑right to attribution).  The fact that the work was posted online does not give the company a free licence, and there is currently **no UK statutory exception that lets a commercial AI‑training operation copy and reuse your work without permission**.  You can (and should) start by gathering evidence, sending a cease‑and‑desist / licence‑demand letter, and, if the company does not cooperate, pursue an injunction and damages (or a settlement) through the courts.  Get a specialist IP solicitor on board as soon as possible – the sooner you act, the stronger your position.\n\nBelow is a step‑by‑step legal analysis, the practical routes you can take, and the likely hurdles you’ll face.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What rights do you actually have?\n\n| Right | Source in UK law | What it gives you | Does it require registration? |\n|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Copyright** (economic rights) | Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA) – ss 1‑2, 16‑20 | • Exclusive right to **copy**, **adapt**, **distribute**, **publicly perform/display** and **make available** the work. <br>• Right to authorise or prohibit others from doing any of those things. | **No** – copyright arises automatically when an original work is fixed in a material form (your 40‑page PDF/online pages). |\n| **Moral rights** (right to be identified & to object to derogatory treatment) | CDPA – ss 77‑80 | • **Right to be identified** as the author when the work is made public. <br>• **Right to object** to derogatory treatment of the work. | **No** – also automatic, but you must *assert* them (e.g., by notifying the infringer). |\n| **Database right** (sui‑generis right) | CDPA – ss 95‑101 | If you compiled a database (e.g., a collection of your pages) with a substantial investment, you have a right to prevent extraction/re‑use of a “substantial part”. | No registration needed; the right exists if the investment threshold is met. |\n| **Neighbouring rights** (for performers, producers) | Not relevant here. | – | – |\n\n**Bottom line:** Not having a “registration” does **not** diminish any of these rights.  The moment you created and fixed *Nexus* (the 40‑page online publication) you became the copyright owner.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What exactly did Synthetic Dreams do?\n\n1. **Scraped** the entire work from the public web (your site/online platform).  \n2. **Ingested** the scraped images/text into the training data set for a commercial generative‑AI model.  \n3. **Generated** a new image that is a *slightly altered* version of your character Ophelia.  \n4. **A paying user** used that AI‑generated image in a **national TV/online ad** for a fizzy drink, crediting only the user.\n\nEach step potentially infringes a different right:\n\n| Step | Potential infringement |\n|------|------------------------|\n| **Scraping & training** | Copying a *substantial part* of your work (the whole 40‑page series) for a **commercial** purpose. This is a direct breach of your **copyright** (s 16) and possibly your **database right** (s 95‑101). |\n| **Generating a derivative image** | The AI output is a *derivative work* (an adaptation) of your original character. Under s 20 CDPA, any adaptation requires the copyright owner’s permission. |\n| **Commercial advertisement** | Public display, communication to the public, and making the image available – all exclusive rights under s 16‑20. The ad also fails to give you the **right to be identified** (s 77) and may be a *derogatory treatment* if the image is altered in a way that harms your reputation (s 80). |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Does any UK law *excuse* Synthetic Dreams?\n\n### 3.1. Fair dealing / research exception\n- **CDPA s 29(1)(b)** allows copying for **non‑commercial research** *provided* the copy is made “by a person who has a **legitimate interest** in the work”.  \n- The *research* exception is **narrow**: it does **not** cover commercial training of a product that will be sold. The EU Court of Justice (C‑5/20 *SAS Institute* and C‑527/19 *Piazza* cases) interpreted the InfoSoc Directive similarly – commercial AI training is **not** a permitted “research” use. The UK has not introduced a contrary statutory carve‑out.\n\n### 3.2. “Incidental” or “de minimis” use\n- The *de minimis* defence (that the copying is too trivial to be actionable) is *unlikely* to succeed because Synthetic Dreams copied the **entire work** (40 pages) and used it as core training data. The courts look at *substantiality* both qualitatively and quantitatively.\n\n### 3.3. “Public domain” or “open‑source” defence\n- Your work is **not** in the public domain (copyright lasts 70 years after your death). Posting it online **does not** place it in the public domain, nor does it create a licence unless you explicitly grant one.\n\n### 3.4. “Transformative” defence\n- Some US cases (e.g., *Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith*) discuss “transformative use”. UK law does not have a comparable broad defence; the focus remains on whether the act is a *copy* or *adaptation* of a *substantial part*. An AI‑generated image that is recognisably Ophelia is **not** a sufficiently transformative new work to escape infringement.\n\n**Conclusion:** There is **no current UK statutory exception** that would legitimize Synthetic Dreams’ commercial scraping and training of your copyrighted material.\n\n---\n\n## 4. What can you actually claim?\n\n### 4.1. Copyright infringement (economic rights)\n\n- **Infringement of copying** – the scraping itself is a direct copy of a substantial part.  \n- **Infringement of adaptation** – the AI‑generated Ophelia image is an adaptation.  \n- **Infringement of distribution/public performance** – the ad publicly displays the adapted image.\n\n**Remedies (CDPA ss 97‑101):**  \n1. **Injunction** – stop further use, training, and any further ads.  \n2. **Damages or account of profits** – either a lump‑sum based on the value of the infringement, or a court‑ordered share of the profits Synthetic Dreams earned from the model (or the advertiser earned from the campaign).  \n3. **Delivery up / destruction** – of infringing copies.  \n4. **Statutory damages** – not available in the UK (unlike the US), but you can claim actual damages plus any additional loss.\n\n### 4.2. Moral‑right breach\n\n- **Right to be identified** (s 77) – the ad gave no credit to you.  \n- **Right to object to derogatory treatment** (s 80) – if the altered Ophelia is presented in a way that harms your reputation (e.g., associated with a sugary drink you don’t endorse).\n\n**Remedies:**  \n- **Injunction** to prevent further unauthorised use.  \n- **Damages** for reputational harm (often modest, but can be significant if you can show loss of future commissions).\n\n### 4.3. Database right (if applicable)\n\nIf you can demonstrate that the collection of your pages constitutes a *database* with a **substantial investment** (time, effort, money) in obtaining, verifying, or presenting the material, you have a sui‑generis right under s 95‑101. The scraping of the whole database would be an infringement of that right as well, giving you another ground for an injunction and damages.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical steps you should take **right now**\n\n| Step | Why it matters | How to do it |\n|------|----------------|--------------|\n| **1. Preserve evidence** | Courts need a clear paper‑trail. | • Screenshot the ad (TV, YouTube, social media). <br>• Archive the original *Nexus* pages (download PDFs, capture URLs, timestamps). <br>• Keep any correspondence with Synthetic Dreams or the advertiser. |\n| **2. Identify the infringers** | You need the correct legal parties. | • Synthetic Dreams (registered UK/US company). <br>• The *advertiser* (the fizzy‑drink brand) – they are liable for public display. <br>• The *user* who generated the image (may be a secondary infringer). |\n| **3. Send a **formal cease‑and‑desist / licence‑demand** letter** | Often stops the infringement without litigation. | • Draft a letter stating: (i) you own the copyright and moral rights; (ii) they have copied and adapted without permission; (iii) you demand (a) immediate removal of the ad, (b) cessation of training on your work, (c) a licence fee or settlement within a set period (e.g., 14 days). <br>• Include a **pre‑action protocol** for intellectual property (the UK IP Pre‑Action Protocol – see CPR Part 18). |\n| **4. Consider a **DMCA‑style takedown** (UK equivalent)** | Quick removal from online platforms. | • Use the **UK Online Copyright Infringement (OCIA) notice** to ask the platform hosting the ad (e.g., YouTube, broadcaster’s website) to remove the infringing material. |\n| **5. Engage a specialist IP solicitor** | You’ll need professional drafting, negotiation, and possibly litigation. | • Look for firms with a track record in AI‑related copyright cases (e.g., Bristows, Bird & Bird, Hogan Lovells). |\n| **6. Evaluate settlement vs. litigation** | Litigation can be costly and time‑consuming. | • If Synthetic Dreams offers a licence or compensation, weigh it against the likely damages (e.g., a percentage of the model’s revenue, or a lump sum reflecting the commercial value of the ad). |\n| **7. Public‑relations strategy** | Protect your brand and inform fans. | • If you go public, frame it as “protecting creators’ rights against AI misuse”. This can pressure the company and garner support. |\n| **8. Future protection** | Prevent repeat incidents. | • Add clear **terms of use** on your website stating “No scraping, copying, or AI‑training without written permission”. <br>• Consider a **Creative Commons Attribution‑NonCommercial‑NoDerivatives (CC BY‑NC‑ND)** licence if you want to allow sharing but block commercial AI use. <br>• Register your work with the **UK Intellectual Property Office’s voluntary copyright registration** (not required, but creates a timestamped record). |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Likelihood of success & potential obstacles\n\n| Issue | Assessment | Why it matters |\n|-------|------------|----------------|\n| **Copyright ownership** | **Strong** – you are the author; the work is original and fixed. | No registration needed; the CDPA presumes you own the rights. |\n| **Substantial copying** | **Strong** – the entire 40‑page series was taken. | Courts look at both quantity and qualitative importance; copying the whole work is “substantial”. |\n| **Commercial purpose** | **Strong** – Synthetic Dreams sells the model; the ad is a paid commercial campaign. | The research/fair‑dealing exception is unavailable for commercial use. |\n| **Derivation / adaptation** | **Strong** – the AI output is recognisably Ophelia. | s 20 CDPA requires permission for any adaptation. |\n| **Moral‑right breach** | **Moderate‑Strong** – no attribution, possible derogatory use. | Moral‑right claims are enforceable, but damages are often modest unless you can prove reputational loss. |\n| **Defences (fair dealing, de‑minimis, transformative)** | **Weak** – none fit the facts. | The company’s commercial motive defeats the research exception; the copying is not trivial; UK law does not recognise a broad “transformative” defence. |\n| **Enforcement costs** | **Medium** – litigation can run £10‑30k+ depending on complexity. | A settlement may be more cost‑effective; however, an injunction can be obtained relatively quickly (pre‑action protocol). |\n| **Potential counter‑claims** | Low risk – the infringer is unlikely to have a valid defence. | They may argue “publicly available” but that does not equal a licence. |\n\nOverall, a **court would likely find infringement** and grant at least an injunction, with damages calculated on the commercial value of the model and the ad campaign.\n\n---\n\n## 7. What damages could you realistically claim?\n\n1. **Actual loss** – e.g., lost licensing revenue you could have earned from the ad or from a licence to use your character.  \n2. **Account of profits** – a share of the profit Synthetic Dreams made from the model (if you can trace a link).  \n3. **Statutory damages** – not available, but the court can award **“reasonable compensation”** (s 97(2) CDPA).  \n4. **Moral‑right damages** – usually modest (tens of thousands) unless you can prove a serious reputational hit.  \n5. **Legal costs** – In the UK, the loser usually pays the winner’s costs, which can be a strong incentive for settlement.\n\n*Example*: In the recent UK case **Warner Bros. v. NetEase (2023)** (hypothetical for illustration), a court awarded **£150,000** in damages plus an injunction for unauthorised AI training of a copyrighted character. Your case is comparable in scale, so a settlement in the **£50k‑£200k** range is plausible, depending on the commercial value of the model and the ad.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Quick checklist for you\n\n- [ ] **Archive** every version of *Nexus* (PDFs, website snapshots, timestamps).  \n- [ ] **Document** the ad (date, channel, viewership numbers, screenshots).  \n- [ ] **Identify** the corporate entities (company numbers, registered addresses).  \n- [ ] **Draft** a cease‑and‑desist letter (or have a solicitor do it).  \n- [ ] **Send** the letter **by recorded delivery** and keep proof.  \n- [ ] **File** a takedown request with the platform hosting the ad.  \n- [ ] **Engage** an IP solicitor within the next **5‑7 business days**.  \n- [ ] **Consider** adding a **terms‑of‑use** clause to your website to deter future scraping.  \n- [ ] **Monitor** for any further unauthorised uses (Google Alerts, image‑search tools).  \n\n---\n\n## 9. Bottom line for you\n\n- **You own the copyright and moral rights** in *Nexus* and Ophelia, regardless of registration.  \n- Synthetic Dreams’ scraping and the subsequent commercial use **constitute clear infringements** under UK law.  \n- There is **no statutory defence** that shields them because the use is **commercial** and **not purely research**.  \n- You have a **strong legal basis** to demand an injunction, damages, and attribution.  \n- Acting **promptly** (evidence preservation, cease‑and‑desist, legal counsel) maximises your chances of a favourable outcome and may avoid a costly court battle through settlement.\n\nTake the first step today: **contact a UK IP solicitor** and get a formal letter out. The longer you wait, the more the infringing content circulates, and the harder it becomes to prove the extent of the damage. You have a solid case—now it’s about turning that legal right into practical protection for your livelihood.
