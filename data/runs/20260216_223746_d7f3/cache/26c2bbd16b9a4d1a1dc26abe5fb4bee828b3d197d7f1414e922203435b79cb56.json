The candidate answer discusses Moral Rights (Paternity/Integrity) in Section 2 and Section 4.2, focusing on the Right to be Identified (Paternity) and the Right to Object to Derogatory Treatment (Integrity). It correctly notes the breach of the Right to be Identified due to lack of attribution in the ad. However, it does not explicitly confirm or deny the specific legal requirement mentioned in the criterion: whether a breach of the Moral Right to Integrity (objection to derogatory treatment) requires copying the *dialogue or plot* of the literary work. The answer only vaguely mentions that derogatory treatment occurs if the image is altered in a way that harms reputation. It fails to address the specific legal prerequisite mentioned in the criterion regarding dialogue/plot copying for a moral rights breach.\", \"criterion_id\": \"dee7a094-b7fc-411f-acad-ef932f692be7\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4244, "completion_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 4484}, "latency_s": 1.5418700000154786, "request_id": "D-2UabmSB8eC7M8P_tvRkAs", "raw_response": null}
