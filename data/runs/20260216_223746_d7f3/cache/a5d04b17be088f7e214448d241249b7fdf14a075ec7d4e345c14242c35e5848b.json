The candidate answer discusses self-defence generally, focusing on the client's mistaken belief in the need for force (s.76 CJIA 2008, Williams, Beckford). It does not mention or apply the principle derived from R v Keane [2010] EWCA Crim 1060, which deals specifically with the loss and revival of self-defence when the initial aggressor retaliates, and whether the initial aggressor can regain the right to self-defence if the victim's response is disproportionate.
