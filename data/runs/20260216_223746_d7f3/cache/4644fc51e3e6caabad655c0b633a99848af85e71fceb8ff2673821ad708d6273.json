The candidate answer explicitly addresses this distinction in Section 1, stating: \\\"Equitable remedies (constructive trust, unjust enrichment, contribution) ... do not automatically remove the lender\\u2019s charge... Your constructive-trust claim will then be a right to the remainder of the equity (if any) or a right to contribute against your ex for the value you added.\\\" Furthermore, it contrasts the constructive trust (a right to a share/money) with the mortgage (a real right enforceable by sale). This clearly separates the nature and effect of the two remedies.\", \"criterion_id\": \"944e2205-52aa-406d-b061-82df0456fa31\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4202, "completion_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 4415}, "latency_s": 0.8521824170020409, "request_id": "xOmUaeHmNJ2ExN8PuIHJkAE", "raw_response": null}
