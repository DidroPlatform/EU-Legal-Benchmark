It discusses consent (jurisdiction ratione personae/materiae), connection (a form of admissibility/nexus requirement), and applicable law (which touches on jurisdiction ratione materiae). Crucially, the response notes that even if consent is found, a 'sufficient factual and legal connection' (nexus) is required, which is a common way tribunals treat the scope of the claim beyond pure jurisdiction. The structure clearly separates the consent hurdle (jurisdiction) from the nexus hurdle (often treated as admissibility or scope of the mandate).\", \"criterion_id\": \"5bd9c5b8-913d-4e37-8ca4-67a98f63820c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3319, "completion_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 3510}, "latency_s": 1.045775834005326, "request_id": "H8GUaeXjHemekdUPoPLrcQ", "raw_response": null}
