The candidate answer discusses constructive notice and the possibility of the bank being bound if they had notice of the claimant's interest, but it frames this in terms of the claimant proving the bank had notice ('Prove bank knew/should've known'). It does not explicitly state the principle that a lender's *failure to make reasonable inquiries* (which leads to constructive notice) can bind them, which is a specific concept related to overriding interests binding a purchaser/lender, often distinct from the claimant proving the bank's knowledge in a constructive trust context. The answer focuses more on the priority of the registered charge versus the unregistered equitable interest, and the need to prove notice, rather than the specific mechanism of the lender's duty to inquire leading to an overriding interest binding them.\", \"criterion_id\": \"94c14c26-3d41-4b09-abe3-a18f253ce007\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2105, "completion_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 2348}, "latency_s": 1.1963162920437753, "request_id": "gyeVafDONKOF7M8P9PzH6Ag", "raw_response": null}
