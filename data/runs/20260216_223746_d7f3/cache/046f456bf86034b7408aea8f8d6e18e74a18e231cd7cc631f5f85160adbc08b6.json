The candidate answer discusses general principles of registered land systems (Land Registry, Land Registration Act 2002 equivalents) and the priority rules that apply there, but it never explicitly mentions or contrasts the situation with unregistered land, nor does it specifically reference the *Boland* case or its relevance to the distinction between registered/unregistered land priority rules. The core of the answer focuses on registered land priority rules versus equitable interests, which is related but does not meet the specific requirement of identifying the *distinction* based on registration status as highlighted by *Boland*.\", \"criterion_id\": \"bd1b5326-cf76-40a4-a380-6b611f21cc16\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2107, "completion_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 2313}, "latency_s": 1.1127961250022054, "request_id": "dSeVaab2CPfo7M8PiZSSoQk", "raw_response": null}
