The candidate answer states the opposite regarding goods moving from GB to NI: \\\"Default position \\u2013 a good moving from GB to NI is *assumed not to be at risk* of entering the EU market.\\\" Furthermore, regarding direct imports from third countries (China), the answer states: \\\"The shipment can only use the green lane if the importer can prove that the goods will remain in NI or be re-exported to the EU and are *not on the EU risk register*.\\\" This implies that if the goods are not on the risk register, they are presumed *not* at risk, which contradicts the required explanation that the presumption remains that they *are* at risk unless proven otherwise (or unless they fall under specific green lane criteria which are not the default presumption for *all* goods not covered by the framework arrangements). The answer incorrectly describes the default burden/presumption for goods moving from GB to NI, and does not clearly state the required presumption for all other goods, including direct third-country imports, being 'at risk'.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2f0e047c-09d7-40ee-a04e-af21eca6630e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3954, "completion_tokens": 302, "total_tokens": 4256}, "latency_s": 1.3429925839882344, "request_id": "KPKUaYu2GtqgkdUPg_fLkAM", "raw_response": null}
