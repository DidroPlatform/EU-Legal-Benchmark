This relates to the enforcement powers of the Fire and Rescue Authority under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (specifically Article 26, relating to informal advice vs. formal notices). The candidate answer provides a detailed analysis of liability, legislation, and the adequacy of the risk assessment, but it entirely omits any discussion of the enforcement actions or powers of the fire safety inspector (e.g., issuing an informal notice, a deficiency notice, or a prohibition notice) and the resulting status of the building (remaining open or being closed).
