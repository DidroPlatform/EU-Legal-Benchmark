The candidate answer focuses entirely on the difficulty of achieving the >50% profit shift due to HMRC scrutiny, BEPS rules, and substance requirements, concluding that the client's goal is unviable. It recommends pivoting to a 35-40% shift. However, it never explicitly mentions or discusses the UK Patent Box relief or the trade-off associated with losing it by shifting profits out of the UK structure.
