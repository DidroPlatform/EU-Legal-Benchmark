Information about whether someone *can or cannot* practice a sport reveals information about their **physical condition or limitations**, which qualifies as **special category data** (données sensibles) under **Article 9 of the GDPR**.\n\n## What You Should Have Done\n\n### 1. **Inform the individuals concerned** (Article 13 GDPR)\nAt the time of collection, you needed to tell members:\n- **Who** is responsible for the data (the association)\n- **Why** you're collecting it (planning activities)\n- The **legal basis** for processing (likely **explicit consent** given the health dimension)\n- **How long** the data will be kept\n- Their **rights** (access, rectification, deletion, etc.)\n\n### 2. **Obtain explicit consent**\nSince this is health data, simple \"implied\" consent is generally **not sufficient**. You needed **explicit, informed consent** — ideally a clear opt-in on the form itself.\n\n### 3. **Record of processing activities** (Article 30 GDPR)\nYour association should maintain a **register of processing activities** documenting this collection.\n\n### 4. **CNIL notification?**\nSince 2018 (post-GDPR), you generally **no longer need to declare** processing to the CNIL. However, you remain fully responsible for compliance.\n\n### 5. **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)?**\nGiven the health data and potentially the scale, a DPIA *might* be warranted, though for a small local association this is less likely to be required.\n\n## What You Should Do Now\n\n- **Retroactively inform** your members about the data collected\n- **Secure** the data properly (not just an open spreadsheet accessible to everyone)\n- **Define a retention period** and delete the data when no longer needed\n- **Document** everything in a processing register\n- Consider appointing a **data protection referent** within the association\n\n## Practical Note\n\nThe CNIL has published specific **guidance for associations** (*guide associations*) that is very accessible and practical. It's worth consulting:\n👉 [cnil.fr — Guide for associations](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/rgpd-et-associations)\n\n---\n\nEven with the best intentions, a small association collecting health-adjacent data has real legal obligations. The good news is that getting into compliance retroactively is entirely feasible.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 93, "completion_tokens": 630, "total_tokens": 723}, "latency_s": 14.584331041987753, "request_id": "chatcmpl-4119c2f5-76d3-4386-bbe0-10fd76c64bbf", "raw_response": null}
