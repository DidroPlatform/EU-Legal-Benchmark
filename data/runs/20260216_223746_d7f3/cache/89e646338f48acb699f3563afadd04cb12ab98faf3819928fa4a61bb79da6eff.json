It lists 'All rent payment records' (implying the obligation to pay rent on time), 'Repair request records and responses' (implying the obligation to report repairs and potentially allow access for repairs), and generally refers to gathering evidence showing compliance with 'maintenance' and 'obligations'. While it doesn't list three distinct obligations as separate bullet points, the evidence requested strongly implies the core obligations: paying rent, taking care of the property (maintenance/condition), and cooperating regarding repairs/access. Specifically, the prompt asks what evidence to show regarding fulfilling tenant obligations, and the answer provides evidence related to rent payment, property condition/maintenance, and repair requests/access, which covers at least three core areas.\", \"criterion_id\": \"6488c186-efa8-4d9d-84a7-e426c86d5f92\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 772, "completion_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 981}, "latency_s": 0.9496327079832554, "request_id": "0t-UaZ2-Nc7UvdIPpbuqwQ8", "raw_response": null}
