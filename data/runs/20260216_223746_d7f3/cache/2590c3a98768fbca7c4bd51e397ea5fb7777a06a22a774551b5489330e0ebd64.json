Laws can change, and your situation may have unique details. You should seek free advice from **Citizens Advice** (citizensadvice.org.uk or call 0800 144 8848), **Shelter** (shelter.org.uk or 0808 800 4444), or a solicitor via **Law Centres Network** (lawcentres.org.uk). If eligible, you may get free legal help through **Legal Aid** or a **Housing Loss Prevention Advice Service** (for court hearings).\n\n### Understanding Your Situation\nIn English law (assuming you're in England; rules differ slightly in Scotland/Wales/NI), most private tenancies are **Assured Shorthold Tenancies (ASTs)** under the Housing Act 1988. Landlords typically sue for **possession** (eviction) via **County Court** using:\n- **Section 21** (no-fault eviction, needs valid notice).\n- **Section 8** (fault-based, e.g., rent arrears, anti-social behaviour).\n\nYou say you've paid rent on time and met obligations, so check the **claim form (N5B or similar)** and **particulars of claim** to see the exact grounds. Respond **urgently** – you usually have **14 days** from service to file a **defence** (Form N11) online via Money Claim Online or at court.\n\n### Steps to Prove You're Not in the Wrong\n1. **File Your Defence Promptly**:\n   - Admit/deny each allegation specifically.\n   - State facts: \"Rent paid in full on [dates] via [method]. No breaches.\"\n   - Ask the court to **dismiss the claim** and award you **costs**.\n   - Do this online at gov.uk/make-money-claim or at your local court.\n\n2. **Gather and Organise Evidence** (Crucial – Courts Love Paper Trails):\n   Prove compliance chronologically. Aim for **clear, dated, originals** (scans/photos OK).\n   \n   | Type of Evidence | Examples | Why It Helps |\n   |------------------|----------|-------------|\n   | **Rent Payments** | Bank statements, transfer receipts, standing order proofs, BACS confirmations. | Shows full, on-time payments. If landlord claims arrears, highlight discrepancies. |\n   | **Tenancy Agreement** | Signed copy, highlighting your obligations (e.g., \"Tenant to pay rent by 1st\"). | Proves terms you followed. |\n   | **Correspondence** | Emails/texts/letters with landlord about payments, repairs, notices. | Shows good faith and their responses (or lack). |\n   | **Property Condition** | Dated photos/videos of the property (inside/out, repairs done). Inventory/check-in report. | Counters damage/nuisance claims. |\n   | **Repair/Maintenance** | Records of issues reported (e.g., emails), Gas Safety Certificate, EPC. | Proves you notified them of duties under Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. |\n   | **Witness Statements** | Signed statements from neighbours/guarantors confirming behaviour/payments. | Corroborates your side. |\n   | **Notices Served** | Copies of any Section 21/8 notices – check if valid (e.g., S21 needs \"How to Rent\" guide, deposit protection). | Often invalid, killing their case. |\n\n   - **Tip**: Use a **timeline spreadsheet** (dates, events, evidence refs). Bundle into a paginated file for court.\n\n3. **Prepare for Hearing**:\n   - Most cases go to **hearing** (bring 3 copies of everything).\n   - Represent yourself (litigant in person) or get help from **Housing Duty Solicitor** (free if at risk of homelessness).\n   - Consider **mediation** (free via court) – often resolves disputes.\n\n4. **Counter-Attack if Applicable**:\n   - **Deposit not protected?** Claim up to 3x deposit back (Housing Act 2004).\n   - **Invalid notice?** Automatic win.\n   - **Harassment?** If they've bullied/threatened, claim under Protection from Eviction Act 1977 (court order + damages).\n\n### Legal Consequences for the Landlord if Proven Wrong\nEnglish courts don't treat civil claims like criminal \"wrongful accusations\" (no jail/prison). But if their case is **frivolous, vexatious, or malicious**:\n\n- **Costs Orders**: Court can make landlord pay **your costs** (e.g., lost wages, travel, advice fees). Fixed for small claims (<£10k), up to full costs otherwise. \"Loser pays\" principle.\n- **Wasted Costs Order**: If solicitor involved and acted unreasonably.\n- **Strike Out/Dismissal**: Claim thrown out early; possible **civil restraint order** barring repeat claims.\n- **Damages to You**: Counterclaim for:\n  - Stress/distress (£500–£5k+ if harassment).\n  - Unlawful eviction (if they changed locks etc., up to £25k+ under Deregulation Act 2015).\n  - Breach of quiet enjoyment (e.g., illegal entry).\n- **Deposit Penalty**: 1–3x amount if unprotected.\n- **Rare**: **Malicious Falsehood** tort (prove deliberate lies causing loss) or **abuse of process** – hard to win, needs solicitor.\n\nIf you win, inform your **local council** (homelessness team) for rehousing priority if needed.\n\n### Next Actions (Do Today)\n1. Check court papers/deadlines.\n2. Call Shelter/Citizens Advice for case review.\n3. Use gov.uk/possession-eviction-tenants for templates.\n4. Track via court reference number.\n\nStay calm – tenants win ~50% of defended cases with good evidence.
