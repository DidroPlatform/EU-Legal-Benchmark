The response discusses the self-defence argument, which, if successful, would negate liability for the actus reus/mens rea elements of the offence. However, it never explicitly states that the act of striking the victim with broken glass *did* satisfy the actus reus of s.20 OAPA 1861 (which requires unlawful wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm). While the context implies the act occurred, the required explicit statement confirming the actus reus element was met is missing. The focus is entirely on the justification (self-defence), not the elements of the offence itself.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5043468a-08bd-4d6f-b470-bf183736d7c9\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2244, "completion_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 2459}, "latency_s": 0.7985928329871967, "request_id": "PyWVaejZL4TensEP6bbt4Ac", "raw_response": null}
