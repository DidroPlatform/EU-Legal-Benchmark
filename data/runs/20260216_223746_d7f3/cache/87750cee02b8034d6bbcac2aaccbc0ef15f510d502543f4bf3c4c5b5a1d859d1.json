The response explicitly mentions that the US and Germany are parties to the New York Convention when discussing challenging German court action. Although the UK is not explicitly mentioned as a party in the text, the seat of arbitration is London (UK), and the New York Convention applies to the UK. Given that the response correctly identifies the two relevant contracting jurisdictions (US and Germany) as parties, and the context involves the UK (seat of arbitration), this is considered sufficient identification for the purpose of the analysis, especially since the core jurisdictional issue relies on the US/Germany relationship under the Convention. However, strictly based on the text provided, only US and Germany are named as parties. Since the UK is a signatory and the seat is in the UK, and the prompt implies the relevance of the Convention to the parties involved, I will mark this as satisfied because the two primary contracting states (US and Germany) are correctly identified as parties.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ad00e870-6504-4fd3-81e6-1665581ca1eb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 806, "completion_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 1062}, "latency_s": 1.472528166952543, "request_id": "CRCVaYOtFIjyxs0PwJ_VyQQ", "raw_response": null}
