Specifically, it describes the Green Lane system, which is the mechanism for goods 'not for EU' consumption, and it mentions the presumption that goods are 'not at risk' under this lane. While it doesn't use the exact phrase \\\"trusted traders,\\\" it describes the mechanism that trusted traders would utilize (minimal checks for goods staying in NI). It clearly describes the \\\"Green Lane\\\" and the dual regulatory system which addresses the friction points. The Green Lane functions as the route for goods designated 'not for EU' consumption with minimal scrutiny. The concept of 'trusted traders' is strongly implied by the reduced checks for goods staying in NI. Given the context, the Green Lane description covers the intent of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ccda598d-81f1-4df2-bf89-43523370149a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2985, "completion_tokens": 287, "total_tokens": 3272}, "latency_s": 1.206806542002596, "request_id": "WwGVaZX6J4qjkdUPl43u2QQ", "raw_response": null}
