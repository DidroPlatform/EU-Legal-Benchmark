The candidate answer focuses heavily on the jurisdictional strategy and the defense against the German firm's claims (pretextual termination, implied covenant of good faith, and technical analysis of vulnerabilities). In Section II.A, the candidate analyzes the termination dispute under Delaware law, noting that the German firm's right to terminate depends on whether the vulnerabilities constituted a 'material breach' and whether notice/cure periods were followed. The candidate then frames the client's central narrative as the termination being 'pretextual' (i.e., the real reason was finding a cheaper product). By focusing the substantive strategy on proving the termination was wrongful (i.e., not validly based on breach), the response implicitly or explicitly argues that the client did *not* validly breach the contract, which is the necessary prerequisite for the German firm's termination to be wrongful. The entire substantive section is built around defending the client against the claim that they breached via security vulnerabilities, thus supporting the conclusion that the facts presented do not indicate a valid breach by the client.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d5afc437-3642-4325-9116-f62d2335c899\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4197, "completion_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 4483}, "latency_s": 2.0579742919944692, "request_id": "KMOUaaiGH-XonsEPxa3MyQI", "raw_response": null}
