The candidate answer strongly implies that GDPR requirements *do* apply, stating 'Yes, you likely should have informed members' and listing the necessary steps (transparency, information notice, lawful basis). It does not explicitly discuss or rule out exceptions that might apply to small, non-profit associations (like the exemption for purely personal/household activities or certain processing for non-profit organizations' membership data, though the latter is complex). Since the response focuses on compliance requirements rather than the likelihood of an exception applying, it fails to satisfy the specific requirement of this criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"677ea83d-dbd3-4733-a995-63c750903e31\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 705, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 905}, "latency_s": 0.9787209170171991, "request_id": "0NaUaePCN-mekdUPn_LrcQ", "raw_response": null}
