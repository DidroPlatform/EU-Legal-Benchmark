{"provider": "bedrock", "model": "bedrock/converse/openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0", "text": "## TL;DR  \nYes – under French law (the GDPR as applied in France and the CNIL’s rules) you **must** inform the people whose data you are collecting, give them a clear privacy notice, keep a record of the legal basis you rely on, and respect a whole set of safeguards because the information you asked for (ability / inability to practice sports) is considered **health‑related (special‑category) data**.  \n\nBelow you’ll find a step‑by‑step checklist, the legal reasoning behind it, and practical templates you can adapt for your association.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why the information you collected is “sensitive” data  \n\n| What you asked for | How the GDPR classifies it |\n|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Whether a member **can or cannot practice a given sport** (e.g., “I have a heart condition, I cannot run”) | **Special‑category personal data** – “data concerning health” (Article 9(1) GDPR). Even if the answer is simply “I’m able”, the question itself reveals a health status (or the *absence* of a limitation) and therefore falls under the health‑data umbrella. |\n| Any answer that reveals a **medical condition, disability, chronic disease, injury, or limitation** | Same – health data. |\n\nBecause health data are *extra‑protected*, the GDPR imposes stricter rules than for ordinary personal data:\n\n* **Explicit consent** (or another narrow legal ground) is required.  \n* **Data‑subject information** (privacy notice) is mandatory.  \n* **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** is often required when you process health data on a systematic basis.  \n* **Record‑keeping** (the “register of processing activities”) is compulsory for most data controllers, including most associations.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Who is the “data controller”?  \n\nYour association (the **association loi 1901** that organised the questionnaire) is the **data controller** because it decides *why* and *how* the data are processed.  \n\n- Even if the activity is purely “voluntary” and “non‑commercial”, the GDPR applies to any entity that processes personal data of individuals located in the EU.  \n- As a controller you are responsible for complying with all GDPR obligations and for dealing with the CNIL (the French data‑protection authority) if required.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Legal basis for processing health data  \n\n### 3.1. Explicit consent (the safest route)\n\n| Requirement | What it looks like in practice |\n|-------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous** | A separate consent tick‑box (not pre‑checked) that says something like: “I expressly consent to the association collecting and processing my health‑related information (ability/inability to practice the listed sports) for the purpose of planning activities.” |\n| **Granular** | If you later want to use the data for a different purpose (e.g., a health‑promotion campaign), you need a *new* consent for that purpose. |\n| **Documented** | Keep a signed (or electronically logged) record of each member’s consent, with date and version of the consent text. |\n| **Withdrawable at any time** | Provide a simple way for members to revoke consent (e.g., reply “STOP” to a dedicated email address). |\n\n> **Tip:** Because consent for health data must be *explicit*, a simple “I agree” tick‑box is **not enough**. Use a statement that repeats the exact purpose and the type of data.\n\n### 3.2. Other possible bases (only if you can justify them)\n\n| Basis | When it could apply | What you must prove |\n|-------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| **Public interest in the area of public health** (Art. 9(2)(i) GDPR) | If the activity is part of a **public‑health mission** mandated by a public authority (e.g., a municipal health‑prevention program). | You need a **legal act** (municipal decree, public‑health order) that explicitly authorises the processing. |\n| **Vital interests** (Art. 9(2)(c)) | If the data are needed to protect the life of the data subject or another person (e.g., emergency medical response). | Very narrow; unlikely to fit a sports‑planning questionnaire. |\n| **Legitimate interests** (Art. 9(2)(f)) | Rarely accepted for health data because the “special‑category” rule overrides the normal legitimate‑interest test. | You would need a **DPIA** and a strong justification that the interest outweighs the data subject’s rights. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** For a typical association‑run questionnaire, **explicit consent** is the most straightforward and defensible legal basis.\n\n---\n\n## 4. What you *must* tell the members (privacy notice)\n\nThe GDPR (Art. 13 & 14) requires you to give data subjects **concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible** information *before* you collect the data. Below is a ready‑to‑use template (French version, because you’re in France) that you can adapt.\n\n### 4.1. Core elements (must‑have)\n\n| Element | What to say (French) | Why it matters |\n|---------|----------------------|----------------|\n| **Identité du responsable** | “Le responsable du traitement est l’Association X, 12 rue Y, 75000 Paris. Vous pouvez nous contacter à l’adresse info@associationx.org ou au 01 23 45 67 89.” | Allows the data subject to know who holds the data. |\n| **Finalité du traitement** | “Les réponses seront utilisées uniquement pour planifier les activités sportives de l’association, afin d’adapter le programme aux capacités de chaque membre.” | Shows purpose limitation. |\n| **Base juridique** | “Le traitement repose sur votre consentement explicite, que vous pouvez retirer à tout moment.” | Shows lawful basis. |\n| **Catégories de données** | “Nous collectons des informations de santé (capacité ou incapacité à pratiquer les sports listés).” | Identifies special‑category data. |\n| **Destinataires** | “Les données seront accessibles uniquement aux membres du bureau organisateur (président, secrétaire, trésorier) et aux animateurs chargés de la mise en place des activités.” | Limits who can see the data. |\n| **Transferts hors UE** | “Aucun transfert de données hors de l’Union européenne n’est prévu.” (or describe if any). | Required if data leave the EU. |\n| **Durée de conservation** | “Les réponses seront conservées pendant 24 mois à compter de la date de collecte, puis seront supprimées ou anonymisées.” | Shows retention policy. |\n| **Droits** | “Vous avez le droit d’accéder, de rectifier, d’effacer, de limiter le traitement, de vous opposer et de porter plainte auprès de la CNIL.” | Informs about GDPR rights. |\n| **Délégué à la protection des données (DPD/DPO)** (if you have one) | “Vous pouvez contacter notre DPD, Mme Dupont, à dpo@associationx.org.” | Optional but recommended. |\n| **Lien vers la politique de confidentialité complète** | “Consultez notre politique de confidentialité complète ici : https://associationx.org/rgpd” | Provides more detail. |\n\n### 4.2. How to deliver the notice\n\n| Method | When |\n|--------|------|\n| **Embedded in the questionnaire** – a short paragraph at the top, with a link to the full notice. | Before the first question. |\n| **Separate email** – send a “privacy notice” email to all members *before* the questionnaire launch, asking them to read it and confirm they understand. | 1‑2 weeks before the deadline. |\n| **Printed version** – if you distribute paper forms at a meeting, attach a printed notice and ask for a signature confirming they have read it. | At the meeting. |\n\n> **Tip:** Keep a copy (PDF) of the notice you sent and the date you sent it. This is evidence of compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Record‑keeping & internal documentation\n\n| Document | Why you need it | Where to store it |\n|----------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Registre des activités de traitement** (Article 30 GDPR) | Shows you have a systematic overview of every processing operation. | Secure, access‑restricted drive (e.g., encrypted folder on the association’s server). |\n| **Consent logs** (who consented, when, version of consent text) | Proves you have a valid legal basis. | Same place as the register; keep a backup. |\n| **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** (if required) | Demonstrates you have evaluated risks for health data. | PDF, stored with the register. |\n| **Policy & procedures** (data‑subject request handling, breach notification) | Shows you can act quickly if a request or breach occurs. | Shared folder for the board. |\n| **Security measures** (encryption, access control list) | Evidence of “integrité et confidentialité” (Art. 5(1)(f) GDPR). | Documented in an IT‑security plan. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Security & confidentiality measures (practical)\n\n| Measure | How to implement it for a small association |\n|---------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Access control** | Only the board members who need the data (e.g., activity coordinator) have a password‑protected account. Use role‑based permissions. |\n| **Encryption** | If you store the data electronically (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.), encrypt the file (e.g., with 256‑bit AES) and keep the password separate. |\n| **Secure transmission** | Use HTTPS for any online form (e.g., Google Forms with “Collect email addresses” + “Require sign‑in” + “Encrypt responses”). |\n| **Paper records** | Store any printed questionnaires in a locked cabinet, accessible only to the designated officers. |\n| **Retention & deletion** | Set a calendar reminder for the date 24 months after collection to delete or anonymise the data. |\n| **Backup** | Keep an encrypted backup on an external drive stored in a safe place (or a secure cloud with end‑to‑end encryption). |\n\n---\n\n## 7. What to do if you *didn’t* inform members before collecting the data\n\n1. **Stop the processing** immediately until you have a proper notice and consent.  \n2. **Notify the members** retroactively: send an email (or postal letter) explaining what data were collected, why, and that you are now obtaining explicit consent.  \n3. **Ask for explicit consent** (as described in §3.1). If a member refuses, **delete** their data without delay.  \n4. **Document** the whole remedial process (date of notification, number of consents obtained, deletions performed). This will be useful if the CNIL ever asks for evidence of compliance.  \n\n> **Risk:** If the CNIL discovers that health data were processed without a valid legal basis, it can impose a fine (up to €20 million or 4 % of global turnover) and order you to delete the data. For a small association the fine is usually modest, but the reputational damage can be significant.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Do you need to register the processing with the CNIL?\n\n- **Since 2020**, the CNIL no longer requires a *general* filing of a “declaration” for most processing activities.  \n- However, **if you process special‑category data on a systematic basis**, you **must** conduct a **DPIA** and be ready to present it to the CNIL on request.  \n- If your activity is *exceptional* (e.g., a one‑off questionnaire) and you have explicit consent, a DPIA may not be mandatory, but it is **strongly recommended** because it demonstrates good governance.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Quick‑start checklist for your association\n\n| ✅ | Action | Details / Tools |\n|---|--------|-----------------|\n| 1 | **Identify the data** | List each sport and the possible health‑related answer (e.g., “I cannot run because of asthma”). |\n| 2 | **Choose legal basis** | Use explicit consent. Draft a consent statement. |\n| 3 | **Write a privacy notice** | Use the template above; translate to French if needed. |\n| 4 | **Create a consent log** | Spreadsheet with columns: Member name, email, date of consent, version of consent text, consent status (yes/no). |\n| 5 | **Set up a secure collection method** | - Online: Google Forms (with “Collect email addresses” + “Require sign‑in”) + enable “Response destination” → encrypted Google Sheet.<br>- Paper: printed form + lockable box. |\n| 6 | **Inform members** | Send email with notice and link to the form; ask them to tick the consent box before proceeding. |\n| 7 | **Store data securely** | Encrypt the file, limit access to the activity coordinator and the treasurer. |\n| 8 | **Plan retention** | Calendar reminder for 24 months → delete or anonymise. |\n| 9 | **Prepare for data‑subject requests** | Draft a short email template: “We have received your request to access/erase your data…”. |\n|10| **Document everything** | Register the processing in your “Registre des activités” and keep the DPIA (even if brief). |\n|11| **Review annually** | Check that the notice is still up‑to‑date, consent is still valid, and security measures work. |\n\n---\n\n## 10. Sample consent text (French)\n\n> **Consentement explicite**  \n> \n> « Je, soussigné(e) ______________________, donne mon **consentement explicite** à l’Association X pour collecter et traiter les informations relatives à ma capacité ou incapacité à pratiquer les sports listés ci‑dessous, **exclusivement** dans le but d’organiser et d’adapter les activités sportives de l’association.  \n> \n> Je reconnais avoir lu la notice d’information (voir lien) et je comprends que je peux retirer mon consentement à tout moment, sans préjudice, en contactant l’association à l’adresse info@associationx.org. »  \n> \n> ☐ **Oui, je consens**   ☐ **Non, je ne consens pas**  \n\n*Place the two boxes at the very end of the questionnaire (or as a separate tick‑box before the first question).*\n\n---\n\n## 11. Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Do I need a Data Protection Officer (DPO)?** | Only if the association processes data on a *large scale* or is a public authority. For a small local association, a DPO is **not mandatory**, but you can appoint a volunteer with basic GDPR knowledge to act as a “point of contact”. |\n| **Can I use Google Forms?** | Yes, provided the form is **hosted in the EU** (Google offers EU‑based data centers) and you have a **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** with Google (standard for G‑Suite/Google Workspace). |\n| **What if a member never gave consent but we already have their answer?** | Delete that person’s data immediately. Keep a record of the deletion for audit purposes. |\n| **Is it okay to ask “Do you have any medical condition that prevents you from doing X?”** | Yes, if you have explicit consent and the question is **necessary and proportionate** to the purpose (i.e., you need to know to avoid assigning a risky activity). Avoid overly broad or intrusive questions. |\n| **What if a member later tells us they have a new limitation?** | Treat it as a **new data collection**: obtain fresh consent and update the record. |\n| **Do we need to inform the CNIL if we get a data‑subject request?** | No, you only need to **respond to the request** within one month. Notify the CNIL **only if** you cannot comply (e.g., the request is manifestly unfounded) or if a **data breach** occurs. |\n| **What constitutes a data breach in this context?** | Any accidental or unlawful loss, alteration, or disclosure of the health data (e.g., an unencrypted email sent to the wrong person). If the breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the members, you must **notify the CNIL within 72 hours** and inform the affected members without undue delay. |\n\n---\n\n## 12. Bottom line for your association\n\n1. **Yes, you had to inform members** before collecting the questionnaire because you were dealing with health‑related data.  \n2. **The safest legal basis** is **explicit, written consent** from each member.  \n3. **Provide a clear privacy notice** (the template above) *before* the questionnaire is filled out.  \n4. **Store the data securely**, limit access, and delete it after a reasonable period (e.g., 24 months).  \n5. **Document everything** (consent log, processing register, DPIA) so you can prove compliance if the CNIL asks.\n\nBy following the checklist and using the templates, you’ll bring your association’s data practices into line with the GDPR and the CNIL’s expectations, while still being able to plan your sports activities responsibly.  \n\n---\n\n### Need a ready‑to‑use document?\n\nIf you’d like a **downloadable PDF** of the privacy notice + consent form, just let me know and I’ll generate one for you.  \n\nGood luck with your preventive‑health activities, and feel free to ask any follow‑up questions!", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 149, "completion_tokens": 4005, "total_tokens": 4154}, "latency_s": 16.60084724999615, "request_id": "chatcmpl-97acd13a-ba4d-4065-9e03-26fe869855e1", "raw_response": null}
