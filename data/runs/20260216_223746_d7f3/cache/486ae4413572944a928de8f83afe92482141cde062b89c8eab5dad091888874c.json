While theoretically possible, tribunals apply stringent tests that most counterclaims fail to satisfy.\n\n---\n\n## I. The Jurisdictional Framework: Three Core Tests\n\n### **A. Consent (Jurisdictional Prerequisite)**\n\n**The fundamental barrier**: Investment treaties typically grant jurisdiction only over claims *by* investors *against* states, not vice versa.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n\n1. **Express consent required**: Absent explicit treaty language authorizing counterclaims, tribunals must find consent in:\n   - The treaty's dispute resolution clause\n   - The applicable arbitration rules\n   - The investor's conduct (arguable waiver)\n\n2. **Leading authority - *Urbaser v. Argentina* (2016)**:\n   - **First tribunal to accept jurisdiction over a counterclaim** based on human rights obligations\n   - Found consent in:\n     - Argentina-Spain BIT's broad \"disputes concerning an investment\" language\n     - ICSID Convention Art. 46 (incidental claims)\n     - Investor's submission to arbitration\n   - **Ultimately dismissed on merits** (no breach found)\n\n3. **Contrast: *Roussalis v. Romania* (2011)**:\n   - Rejected counterclaim despite similar BIT language\n   - Held Greece-Romania BIT's asymmetric clause (only investor could initiate) precluded state counterclaims\n   - \"The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over claims brought by the Respondent\"\n\n**Your case**: The Brazil-Poland BIT's silence is **problematic**. Under UNCITRAL Rules Art. 21(3), counterclaims are permitted, but this doesn't cure lack of consent in the underlying treaty.\n\n---\n\n### **B. Connection Test (Ancillary Jurisdiction)**\n\nEven if consent exists, counterclaims must be **sufficiently connected** to the investor's claim.\n\n**Standards applied:**\n\n1. **\"Directly connected\" test** (*Saluka v. Czech Republic*, 2006):\n   - Counterclaim must arise from same transaction/facts as primary claim\n   - Czech Republic's counterclaim for tax liabilities: **rejected** as insufficiently connected to expropriation claim\n\n2. **\"Same investment/legal relationship\" test** (*Goetz v. Burundi*, 1998):\n   - ICSID tribunal allowed counterclaim for repayment of investment incentives\n   - Arose from same investment contract as investor's claim\n\n3. **Spectrum of connection**:\n   - **Narrow**: Same contract/transaction (most tribunals)\n   - **Broad**: Same investment generally (*Urbaser* approach)\n   - **Rejected**: General regulatory violations unrelated to investor's claims\n\n**Your case**: Poland will argue environmental damage from farm construction is:\n- ✓ **Connected**: Arises from same investment\n- ✓ **Factually related**: Construction activities are subject of investor's claim\n- ? **Legally related**: Depends on whether investor alleges state interference with construction\n\n---\n\n### **C. Applicable Law & Legal Basis**\n\nThe counterclaim must be based on **law within the tribunal's jurisdiction**.\n\n**Three categories:**\n\n### **1. Treaty-Based Counterclaims**\n- **Most likely to succeed** if BIT imposes investor obligations\n- **Problem**: Most BITs contain only state obligations\n- **Exception**: Recent treaties with corporate social responsibility clauses\n  - 2016 Morocco-Nigeria BIT (Art. 18: investor human rights duties)\n  - 2020 Netherlands Model BIT\n\n**Your case**: Review Brazil-Poland BIT for any investor obligation clauses (unlikely in older treaties).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Contract-Based Counterclaims**\n\n- **Generally accepted** if investment involves contract (*Goetz*, *Antoine Goetz v. Burundi*)\n- Tribunal has jurisdiction over \"investment dispute\" including contractual obligations\n\n**Your case**: Does the farm operate under:\n- Investment agreement with Poland?\n- Environmental permits with conditions?\n- Concession contract?\n\nIf yes, counterclaim may be admissible if based on contractual breach.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Domestic Law Counterclaims**\n\n**Most controversial and usually rejected**.\n\n**Arguments against** (*Saluka*, *Roussalis*):\n- Investment tribunals lack jurisdiction over pure domestic law claims\n- Would transform ISDS into general civil litigation\n- Investor didn't consent to defend domestic law claims in arbitration\n- Forum non conveniens: domestic courts are proper venue\n\n**Arguments for** (*Urbaser*, *Perenco v. Ecuador*):\n- Tribunal has jurisdiction over \"all disputes\" concerning the investment\n- Necessary for complete dispute resolution\n- Prevents investor impunity\n- Domestic remedies may be inadequate (especially if state alleges investor corruption)\n\n**Key case - *Perenco v. Ecuador* (2019)**:\n- Ecuador counterclaimed for **$2.7 billion** in environmental damage\n- Tribunal accepted jurisdiction over domestic environmental law claims\n- Found connection through umbrella clause and \"any dispute\" language\n- **Awarded Ecuador $54 million** on counterclaim (reduced from billions claimed)\n\n**Your case**: Poland's environmental counterclaim faces hurdles:\n- ❌ Domestic environmental law typically outside treaty scope\n- ❌ Proper forum is Polish courts\n- ✓ But *Perenco* precedent may support if BIT has broad dispute clause\n\n---\n\n## II. Procedural Requirements\n\n### **A. Timing**\n- Must be raised **during proceedings**, not after award\n- UNCITRAL Rules Art. 21(3): counterclaim in Statement of Defence or later with tribunal permission\n\n### **B. Set-Off vs. Independent Relief**\nTribunals distinguish:\n\n1. **Set-off counterclaims** (defensive):\n   - Reduce investor's damages\n   - More readily accepted (*Occidental v. Ecuador*, 2012: reduced award by $1.8B for environmental liabilities)\n\n2. **Affirmative counterclaims** (offensive):\n   - Seek independent award for state\n   - Higher jurisdictional bar\n   - *Urbaser*: accepted jurisdiction but rare\n\n---\n\n## III. Strategic Considerations for Your Case\n\n### **Likely Outcome: Inadmissible**\n\n**Weaknesses of Poland's counterclaim:**\n\n1. **Consent problem**: \n   - BIT silence suggests no consent to state claims\n   - UNCITRAL Rules don't cure treaty deficiency\n   - Distinguish from ICSID Convention Art. 46 (explicit ancillary jurisdiction)\n\n2. **Applicable law**:\n   - Pure domestic environmental claim\n   - Not based on BIT obligations (unless treaty has environmental provisions)\n   - Polish courts are proper forum\n\n3. **Precedent**:\n   - Most counterclaims rejected (*Saluka*, *Roussalis*, *Spyridon Roussalis*)\n   - *Urbaser* accepted jurisdiction but dismissed on merits\n   - *Perenco* is outlier (and controversial)\n\n### **Stronger Arguments if:**\n\n- ✓ BIT contains \"all disputes concerning the investment\" language (*Urbaser* standard)\n- ✓ Farm operates under investment agreement/permit with environmental conditions\n- ✓ Counterclaim seeks set-off rather than affirmative relief\n- ✓ Environmental damage directly caused by construction investor claims was wrongfully stopped\n\n---\n\n## IV. Recommended Response Strategy\n\n### **Jurisdictional Objections:**\n\n1. **Lack of consent**:\n   - BIT grants jurisdiction only over investor claims against state\n   - Asymmetric dispute resolution clause\n   - State cannot \"counterclaim\" under unilateral offer to arbitrate\n\n2. **No legal basis**:\n   - Counterclaim based on domestic law outside tribunal's jurisdiction\n   - BIT imposes no environmental obligations on investors\n   - Tribunal constituted under treaty, not as general civil court\n\n3. **Forum non conveniens**:\n   - Polish courts are proper forum for environmental claims\n   - Domestic law claims should be litigated domestically\n   - Investor hasn't waived right to object to jurisdiction over counterclaims\n\n### **Alternative Arguments (if jurisdiction found):**\n\n4. **Insufficient connection**:\n   - Environmental damage claim not directly connected to investor's treaty claims\n   - Separate cause of action requiring separate proceedings\n\n5. **Set-off only**:\n   - Even if admissible, counterclaim should only reduce damages, not create independent award\n\n---\n\n## V. Key Cases Summary\n\n| Case | Year | Counterclaim | Outcome | Reasoning |\n|------|------|--------------|---------|-----------|\n| **Saluka v. Czech Rep.** | 2006 | Tax liabilities | ❌ Rejected | Insufficient connection |\n| **Roussalis v. Romania** | 2011 | Contractual damages | ❌ Rejected | No consent in BIT |\n| **Urbaser v. Argentina** | 2016 | Human rights violations | ✓ Jurisdiction (❌ merits) | Broad BIT language + ICSID Art. 46 |\n| **Perenco v. Ecuador** | 2019 | Environmental damage ($2.7B) | ✓ Accepted ($54M awarded) | Umbrella clause + connection |\n| **Occidental v. Ecuador** | 2012 | Environmental liabilities | ✓ Set-off ($1.8B reduction) | Defensive use accepted |\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion & Client Advice\n\n**Bottom line**: Poland's counterclaim faces **significant jurisdictional obstacles** and will likely be **dismissed** unless:\n\n1. The Brazil-Poland BIT contains unusually broad \"all disputes\" language\n2. The farm operates under an investment contract with environmental obligations\n3. The tribunal adopts the minority *Perenco* approach\n\n**Recommended approach**:\n- File **preliminary objection** to jurisdiction over counterclaim\n- Emphasize lack of consent and improper legal basis\n- Argue Polish courts are proper forum\n- Prepare merits defense as fallback (limitation, causation, damages)\n\n**Risk**: Even if counterclaim fails, it may:\n- Complicate proceedings and increase costs\n- Influence tribunal's damages calculation (equitable considerations)\n- Create settlement leverage for Poland\n\nWould you like me to draft the jurisdictional objection or analyze the specific BIT language?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 151, "completion_tokens": 2462, "total_tokens": 2613}, "latency_s": 45.6802729589981, "request_id": "chatcmpl-97302fa0-0648-4d90-accf-8c766d55920f", "raw_response": null}
