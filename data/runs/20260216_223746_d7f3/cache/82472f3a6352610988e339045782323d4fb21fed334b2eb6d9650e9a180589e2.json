{"provider": "vercel_gateway", "model": "vercel_ai_gateway/xai/grok-4.1-fast-reasoning", "text": "**Yes**, as the head of human resources (HR) of a French Groupement d'Intérêt Public (GIP), you can recruit and employ an agent under a private law regime (e.g., CDI or CDD under the Code du travail), even if the agent contributes to public service activities.\n\n### Key Legal Basis\n- **Default Regime**: Under Article 7 of Decree No. 2004-1005 of September 28, 2004 (relating to GIPs), GIPs are governed by **private law** for staff employment, unless the statutes explicitly provide otherwise. GIPs are legal entities under private law designed for collaboration between public and private partners on public interest missions.\n- **Public Service Missions**: The private law regime applies regardless of the public service nature of the activities (e.g., research, training, or operational public tasks). This flexibility is a core feature of GIPs (Ordinance No. 2004-632 of June 30, 2004), allowing agility in recruitment without requiring public law status (fonction publique).\n\n### Practical Considerations\n- **Statutes Check**: Verify your GIP's statutes (approved by decree). If they specify a public law regime (rare, typically only for GIPs composed solely of public entities), you must follow it. Otherwise, private law is the rule.\n- **Recruitment Process**:\n  - Use standard private law procedures: job postings, interviews, contracts compliant with the Code du travail.\n  - No concours (competitive exam) required, unlike for public servants.\n  - Social security: General regime (Sécurité sociale), not public service pension funds unless specified.\n- **Jurisprudence Confirmation**: The Conseil d'État (e.g., CE, 2015, n° 383849) and labor courts consistently uphold private law for GIP staff, treating them as private employees even for public missions.\n- **Exceptions/Limits**:\n  - Detached public agents (détachement) remain under public law.\n  - For highly sovereign public service tasks, statutes might impose public law—consult your legal department.\n  - Ensure compliance with equality of treatment and non-discrimination (e.g., via Pôle emploi or internal rules).\n\nIf your GIP's statutes deviate or for specific cases, consult the founding decree or a public law specialist. This aligns with current practice as of 2023 updates to GIP regulations.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 202, "completion_tokens": 1143, "total_tokens": 1345}, "latency_s": 11.671592875005445, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJ9R00T700MEP7W18W77CP", "raw_response": null}
