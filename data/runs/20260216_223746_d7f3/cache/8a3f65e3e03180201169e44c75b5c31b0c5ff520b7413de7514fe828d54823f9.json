The candidate answer mentions the infringement procedure which is primarily based on Article 258 TFEU (as referenced in the table) and the possibility of the Commission suing before the CJEU, and also mentions Article 263 TFEU (direct action) and Article 267 TFEU (preliminary ruling). However, it does not explicitly mention or outline the mechanism established by Article 260 TFEU (which deals with penalties imposed by the CJEU following an Article 258/260 action). Since the specific article mentioned in the criterion (Article 260) is not outlined, the criterion is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b52013df-322a-4229-b690-922cc99c1e7d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2173, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 2396}, "latency_s": 0.8890268749673851, "request_id": "k_SUaa_BIPDm7M8PqbvO6QU", "raw_response": null}
