{"provider": "bedrock", "model": "bedrock/converse/openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0", "text": "**TL;DR** – Because you have been staying in the flat without paying rent and without a written tenancy agreement, you are most likely a **licensee / unlawful occupier** rather than a tenant with statutory protection. The new owner can ask you to leave, but they must do it **through the courts** (or give you a reasonable notice to quit). You cannot be forced out by the buyer’s “you must go now” or by a change of locks, and you may be able to claim compensation if you are evicted unlawfully. Your best move is to:\n\n1. **Confirm your legal status** (license, periodic tenancy, or squatter).  \n2. **Ask the landlord / buyer for a written notice to quit** (normally 28 days for a licence).  \n3. **If they refuse or try to evict you without a court order, apply for an injunction** to stop an illegal eviction.  \n4. **Consider negotiating a licence or a modest rent** so you can stay legally, or arrange a mutually‑agreed move‑out date.  \n5. **If you think you may have a claim for adverse possession**, start the formal process now (it’s a long, uncertain road).  \n\nBelow is a more detailed walk‑through of the law, your likely position, the protections that do (and do not) apply, and the practical steps you should take.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is your legal status?\n\n| Fact | What the law usually says |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **No written tenancy agreement** | You are not automatically an “assured shorthold tenant” (AST). |\n| **No rent paid** | Most tenancy statutes (Housing Act 1988, Protection from Eviction Act 1977) apply only where a *rent* is payable. |\n| **Landlord gave you permission to stay** (you were “allowed” to occupy the room) | This is normally a **licence** – a personal permission to use the landlord’s property, which can be withdrawn at will, subject to reasonable notice. |\n| **You have been there for 10 years** | Long occupation can sometimes create an *implied periodic tenancy* or give rise to *adverse possession*, but only if you had **exclusive possession** and an intention to treat the room as your own. Sharing the flat with other occupants and the fact that you never paid rent makes a strong adverse‑possession claim unlikely. |\n\n### Most likely scenario: **Licensee / Unlawful Occupier**\n\n* A licence is a personal permission that can be revoked by the licensor (the landlord or, now, the new owner) **with reasonable notice**.  \n* The usual “reasonable notice” in residential licences is **28 days** (the same period the courts have used in many licence‑termination cases).  \n* Because you have not paid rent, you are **not an assured shorthold tenant**, so the statutory “Section 21” (no‑fault) or “Section 8” (fault) notices do **not** apply.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What statutory protections do you have?\n\n| Protection | When it applies | Does it help you? |\n|------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Protection from Eviction Act 1977** (PEA) | Applies to *any* occupier who has a “tenancy” (including licences) – you cannot be evicted without a court order. | **Yes** – the buyer cannot simply change the locks or throw you out; they must obtain a possession order (or give proper notice). |\n| **Housing Act 1988 (AST rules)** | Only for assured shorthold tenancies where rent is payable. | **No** – you are not an AST. |\n| **Human Rights – Article 8 (right to respect for private & family life)** | Can be invoked in eviction cases, but courts balance it against the owner’s property rights. | **Limited** – may give you a chance to argue for a longer notice period or compensation, but will not stop a lawful possession order. |\n| **Adverse possession (Land Registration Act 2002)** | After **10 years** of exclusive, adverse possession of registered land, you can apply to be registered as owner. | **Very unlikely** – you share the flat, you have not paid rent, and the owner (now buyer) has been in contact with you, which defeats the “adverse” element. |\n| **Unlawful eviction / harassment (PEA, Criminal Law)** | If the buyer uses force, changes locks, or threatens you, you can claim criminal harassment and seek damages. | **Yes** – you can claim compensation if they act outside the legal process. |\n\n**Bottom line:** You are **protected from a forced, extra‑legal eviction**, but you **do not have the statutory “right to stay” that an AST tenant enjoys**. The buyer can lawfully ask you to leave, provided they follow the correct procedure.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What can the new owner (buyer) legally do?\n\n1. **Serve a written “notice to quit”** (or “notice of termination of licence”).  \n   * Must be in writing, state the date you must vacate, and give **reasonable notice** – the courts have repeatedly held that **28 days** is reasonable for a residential licence.  \n2. **If you refuse to leave after the notice period**, the owner must **apply to the County Court for a possession order**.  \n   * The court will usually grant the order if the notice was proper and you have no statutory tenancy.  \n3. **If the owner tries to evict you without a court order** (e.g., changing locks, using bailiffs without authority), that is an **illegal eviction** and you can claim damages (up to £5,000 for unlawful eviction plus any loss of belongings).  \n\n---\n\n## 4. What can *you* do right now?\n\n### A. Get your facts straight\n\n| What to look for | Why it matters |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| **Any written agreement** (email, text, note) that mentions “you may stay rent‑free” or “you are a guest” | Shows you were a licencee, not a tenant. |\n| **Evidence of rent‑free arrangement** (e.g., you never paid, landlord never demanded payment) | Confirms you are not an AST. |\n| **Correspondence with the buyer** (the text asking if you still live there, any later messages) | Shows you have been in contact and can be used to prove you were aware of the sale. |\n| **Inventory of your belongings** (photos, receipts) | Useful if you need to claim compensation for loss/damage. |\n\n### B. Request a formal notice\n\n1. **Write to the buyer (or the seller’s solicitor) asking for a written notice to quit** that specifies a vacate date.  \n2. **Ask for a reasonable period** – 28 days is standard, but you can negotiate a longer period if you need more time to find alternative accommodation.  \n3. **Keep a copy** of the letter/email and any reply – this will be evidence if you later need to go to court.\n\n### C. If you receive a notice that is too short or you think it’s unfair\n\n* **Raise a “dispute” with the court** when the buyer files for possession.  \n* You can argue that the notice period is unreasonable (e.g., you have been in the flat for 10 years, you have personal belongings, you need time to relocate).  \n* The court may **extend the notice period** or **grant you a “stay of possession”** (temporary order) while you look for a new place.\n\n### D. Protect yourself from an illegal eviction\n\n* **Do not let anyone change the locks or remove your belongings without a court order.**  \n* If they try, call the police (the act is a criminal offence under the PEA).  \n* Document everything (photos of the door, timestamps of any threats, witnesses).  \n\n### E. Consider negotiating a licence or a modest rent\n\n* Even a **£50‑£100 per month “room licence”** would convert your status to a **licence with consideration**, which gives you a clearer legal footing and may make the landlord more willing to give you a longer notice period.  \n* A written licence can also include a **break clause** that gives you a guaranteed move‑out date (e.g., 3 months’ notice).  \n\n### F. If you want to explore *adverse possession* (long‑shot)\n\n1. **Confirm the property is registered** (most London flats are).  \n2. **Check the title register** (available from the Land Registry) to see who the registered owner is.  \n3. **Adverse possession requires**:  \n   * **Exclusive possession** (you must have been the only one using the room, not sharing with other occupants).  \n   * **Intention to possess** (you must treat the room as your own, not as a guest).  \n   * **No consent** from the owner (the fact that the landlord gave you permission defeats this).  \n4. If you think you meet the criteria, you would **apply to the Land Registry after 10 years** of continuous possession. The registrar will notify the registered owner, who can object. In practice, this route is **rarely successful for licence‑type occupants**.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical “next‑steps” checklist\n\n| Step | What to do | Deadline |\n|------|------------|----------|\n| **1. Gather evidence** | Find any emails, texts, notes, photos of the room, inventory of belongings. | ASAP |\n| **2. Write to the buyer** | Request a formal written notice to quit (28 days) and ask for a reasonable move‑out date. Keep a copy. | Within 2 days |\n| **3. Seek free legal advice** | Contact **Citizens Advice**, **Shelter**, or a **law centre** (e.g., London Legal Support). They can draft the letter and advise on court steps. | Within 1 week |\n| **4. If notice is unreasonable** | Prepare to **defend the possession claim** – gather evidence of long occupation, lack of rent, and any hardship. | When notice is served |\n| **5. Protect belongings** | Pack and label your items, take photos, and store valuables elsewhere if possible. | Ongoing |\n| **6. Consider a licence agreement** | Offer to pay a modest monthly amount to stay legally while you look for a new place. | When negotiating |\n| **7. If evicted** | Apply for **“Housing Benefit”** or **Universal Credit** (if eligible) and look for council‑registered accommodation. | As soon as you have a vacate date |\n| **8. If you suspect illegal eviction** | Call the police, note the incident, and later claim damages (up to £5,000). | Immediately if it happens |\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Bottom line\n\n*You are **not a protected tenant** under the usual AST rules, but you **are protected from an illegal, forcible eviction**. The buyer can lawfully ask you to leave, but they must give you **reasonable written notice (normally 28 days)** and, if you do not vacate, obtain a **court possession order**. If they try to throw you out without that order, you can claim damages and possibly an injunction.*\n\nYour immediate priority is to **obtain a proper written notice**, **seek free legal advice**, and **negotiate a realistic move‑out date** (or a modest licence to stay). If the buyer does not follow the correct legal process, you can go to the County Court to stop an illegal eviction.\n\nGood luck, and don’t hesitate to call Citizens Advice or a local law centre right away – the sooner you get professional advice, the stronger your position will be.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 210, "completion_tokens": 3533, "total_tokens": 3743}, "latency_s": 14.819502457976341, "request_id": "chatcmpl-a4e9dabb-abd4-49d6-ab00-ad161929ed6f", "raw_response": null}
