This tension is analyzed under the 'Applicable Law' section (III.C), where the candidate notes the difficulty of applying domestic law when the BIT's mandate is limited to treaty obligations, and references cases like *Urbaser* where international environmental/human rights norms were considered as a potential bridge. This directly engages with the concept of fragmentation between legal regimes.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ef4586ae-f6d1-4db1-8cf9-39379ed2a524\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3314, "completion_tokens": 163, "total_tokens": 3477}, "latency_s": 1.3687861670041457, "request_id": "UcGUabrgMsLsxN8P5PfhmQE", "raw_response": null}
