The candidate answer discusses the 'goods at risk' test, the risk registers, and the burden of proof, stating that the EU bears the burden to demonstrate risk via its register. It does not explicitly state or confirm that the specific enforcement difficulty related to *raw materials/products that are subsequently processed* remains unresolved despite the Windsor Framework. The answer focuses on the *current* framework for determining risk, not the failure of subsequent instruments to resolve a specific, pre-existing enforcement difficulty.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4415a72c-e330-4316-a7cb-27df04119e0a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3962, "completion_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 4153}, "latency_s": 2.382655124994926, "request_id": "_PGUaaqAG82o_uMP6dKNoQQ", "raw_response": null}
