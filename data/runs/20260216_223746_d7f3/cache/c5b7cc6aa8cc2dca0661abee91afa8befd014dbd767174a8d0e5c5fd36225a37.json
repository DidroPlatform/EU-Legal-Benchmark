The candidate answer discusses procedural risks and coordination strategies but fails to explicitly detail the differences in evidence rules as required by the criterion. It mentions 'High discovery burden (CPR 31)' for the UK and 'extensive e-discovery' for California, but it does not clearly state that Germany requires 'written submissions' or contrast the UK's disclosure scope (documents relied upon) versus California's broad discovery (depositions). The analysis focuses more on litigation structure (GLOs, Class Actions, MDL) than the specific rules governing evidence gathering and presentation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ca0097fe-6cb1-457f-925b-1a1e4893f212\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2604, "completion_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 2807}, "latency_s": 0.7665743330144323, "request_id": "ESaVacyZL6rw7M8P4OXQkQk", "raw_response": null}
