While the response discusses shared responsibility, cooperation under FSO 2005 Art. 22, and the tenant's liability under HSWA 1974, it only mentions the outbuilding was 'part leased' and refers to the tenant company as the 'shared leaseholder'. It does not explicitly discuss how a *commercial lease agreement* itself can legally *assign* or *delegate* specific fire safety duties (like PAT testing or being the RP for their section) to the tenant, which is the core concept of the criterion. The analysis focuses more on general duties and coordination rather than the contractual mechanism of lease assignment of responsibility.\", \"criterion_id\": \"938b8ea8-338e-4b84-90ec-be0a7edc224e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3455, "completion_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 3659}, "latency_s": 3.0166921670315787, "request_id": "W_uUadqpDJzw7M8Pu9TR-AQ", "raw_response": null}
