The candidate answer concludes: \\\"The truck driver's causation is more contestable but likely survives analysis... The truck driver's act remains a more than minimal cause of the serious injury.\\\" It explicitly discusses the truck driver's liability based on the foreseeability of the drunk driver's reaction (i.e., whether it is a *novus actus interveniens*), which directly addresses the condition in the criterion. The analysis supports the conclusion that the truck driver is likely liable unless the intervention breaks the chain.\", \"criterion_id\": \"13ad59d3-0614-44b5-9ff4-b6db76ef2755\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2708, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 2909}, "latency_s": 0.8974281669943593, "request_id": "vsKUafCIF9qE7M8Pyb-HyQ8", "raw_response": null}
