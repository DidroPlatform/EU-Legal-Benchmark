The candidate answer explicitly mentions that the judge requests 'A description of the beneficiary's assets and income (property, pensions, bank accounts) — this helps the judge define the scope of the guardian's powers' under the 'Documents Typically Needed' section. Furthermore, under 'Responsibilities of the Amministratore di Sostegno,' it references the requirement for prior authorization for extraordinary acts and the submission of periodic reports ('rendiconti') to the Giudice Tutelare, which are procedural requirements directly linked to asset management and inventory oversight, implicitly referencing the legal framework governing these duties (e.g., Art. 410 c.c. and related procedural rules for reporting). While it doesn't cite a specific Civil Code article *only* for the inventory itself, it details the documentation required for the judge to establish the scope of powers, which is the core function of the initial inventory process, and references the legal basis for subsequent accountability (Art. 410 c.c.). This is sufficient to meet the requirement of referencing relevant legal bases for asset inventory requirements/oversight.\", \"criterion_id\": \"309c2405-ecd4-4a2c-a518-231740e71554\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2078, "completion_tokens": 289, "total_tokens": 2367}, "latency_s": 3.2713435420009773, "request_id": "dkmUaYG5I8iFxN8PnZ-48Qs", "raw_response": null}
