The candidate answer mentions *Williams & Glyn's Bank v Boland* and discusses actual/constructive notice based on occupation, which is the core principle of *Boland*. However, it fails to explicitly state or discuss the critical distinction regarding registered vs. unregistered land, which is the basis for how *Boland* (unregistered) interacts with later legislation like the Land Registration Act 2002 (registered land). The response focuses entirely on notice and fraud in a registered land context (mentioning Land Registry notices/restrictions) without addressing the registration status distinction required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"bd1b5326-cf76-40a4-a380-6b611f21cc16\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1790, "completion_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 2002}, "latency_s": 1.268592707987409, "request_id": "zcuUaZ_PAarw7M8Pw5-qsA8", "raw_response": null}
