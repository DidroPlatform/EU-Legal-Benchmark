The candidate answer states: \\\"UK law *does* have a text and data mining (TDM) exception, BUT it's primarily for non-commercial research.\\\" This statement is accurate regarding the scope of the exception, but the criterion asks for a statement that it *only* permits copying for non-commercial research. The candidate's phrasing (\\\"primarily for\\\") is slightly softer than the strict requirement of \\\"only permits.\\\" However, upon closer review of s.29A(1) CDPA 1988, the exception is for TDM for the sole purpose of non-commercial research. The candidate's statement is functionally correct in conveying the limitation, but the strict interpretation of the criterion suggests a more definitive statement is required. Given the context of strict judging, the use of 'primarily' instead of 'solely' or 'only' means the criterion is not perfectly satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"31a75734-17b8-403e-b2ce-6c5008078368\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1230, "completion_tokens": 272, "total_tokens": 1502}, "latency_s": 6.047567333007464, "request_id": "t86Uad2OBsf5nsEPi7DUqAI", "raw_response": null}
