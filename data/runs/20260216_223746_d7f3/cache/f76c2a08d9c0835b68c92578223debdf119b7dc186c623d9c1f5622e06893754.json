Statement ii is incorrect - the principle of primogeniture or oldest parental line doesn't work as described; most systems use per stirpes or per capita succession, not excluding children for parents. Statement iii is incorrect - human rights can be justified through various philosophical frameworks (utilitarian, Kantian, natural law) not limited to Western culture. Statement iv is incorrect - Swiss contract law recognizes contracts even with diverging interpretations if there is objective consensus on essential terms; dissent on interpretation doesn't negate contract formation. Statement v is incorrect - having a legal basis for state action does not automatically make it proportionate; proportionality requires separate analysis of necessity and appropriateness. Statements iii and v are clearly incorrect, making C the best answer.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 414, "completion_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 617}, "latency_s": 4.765614000003552, "request_id": "chatcmpl-8f8a193b-1ca0-4b32-beb9-aa63e10e2f92", "raw_response": null}
