The candidate answer mentions the US is a 'first to use' jurisdiction and states, 'If someone in the US begins using your mark before you do, they can develop rights that are very difficult to overcome, even if you registered first in Europe.' It also mentions that someone who can prove they were using the mark in US commerce before you could potentially challenge your rights. However, it does not explicitly state that these prior uses must be considered *during the clearance search* itself, which is the specific focus of the criterion.
