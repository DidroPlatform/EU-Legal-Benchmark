The candidate answer mentions that the choice depends on the GIP's statutes and that the constitutive agreement should specify authorized regimes, and it includes a caveat that some GIPs may have statutory restrictions requiring public law status. However, it does not explicitly state the condition that the GIP *may be governed by public law* if its purpose or convention *requires* it, which is the core assertion of the criterion. It only mentions the possibility of restrictions, not the governing law itself being public law based on the convention.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4497b5d2-6bd3-4985-9d36-5802ba306a90\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 677, "completion_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 861}, "latency_s": 0.7682331250107381, "request_id": "4saUad6qMr3knsEP-_zhiQI", "raw_response": null}
