Without more context, this appears to be a reasonable statement about legal evolution, but I need to consider if it's actually incorrect.\n\n**Statement ii**: \"Swiss commercial law is based on a comprehensive codification of the civil code in the 2000s.\"\n- This is INCORRECT. Swiss commercial law is based on the Swiss Code of Obligations (Obligationenrecht), which dates back to 1881/1911, not the 2000s. The Swiss Civil Code was enacted in 1907/1912.\n\n**Statement iii**: \"The 'Digest' (or 'Pandects') has had a marginal impact on the Western legal tradition, compared to that of the so-called Justinian Code.\"\n- This is INCORRECT. The Digest/Pandects is actually one of the most important parts of Justinian's Corpus Juris Civilis and had enormous influence on Western legal tradition, particularly in civil law systems. It was not marginal at all - it was central to the reception of Roman law in medieval and modern Europe.\n\n**Statement iv**: \"The values 'power' and 'not power' constitute the political system's code according to the sociologist Niklas Luhmann.\"\n- This is INCORRECT. According to Luhmann's systems theory, the binary code of the political system is \"government/opposition\" or \"power/no power\" in terms of holding office, but more precisely it's often described as \"superior/inferior\" or the capacity to make collectively binding decisions. The phrasing \"power and not power\" is oversimplified or incorrect.\n\nStatements ii, iii, and iv are incorrect.\n\nLooking at the options, this corresponds to option H (ii and iii) or potentially other combinations. Let me reconsider statement iv - actually, Luhmann does discuss power in the political system, and the formulation might be acceptable depending on interpretation.\n\nThe clearest incorrect statements are ii and iii.\n\n{\"answer\": \"H\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement ii is incorrect because Swiss commercial law dates to 1881/1911, not the 2000s. Statement iii is incorrect because the Digest/Pandects had enormous, not marginal, impact on Western legal tradition.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 290, "completion_tokens": 553, "total_tokens": 843}, "latency_s": 10.102191042009508, "request_id": "chatcmpl-3937a323-8dfb-4792-a560-2cb532f40479", "raw_response": null}
