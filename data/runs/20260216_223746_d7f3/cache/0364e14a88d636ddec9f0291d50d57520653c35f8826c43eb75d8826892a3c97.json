The answer implies this by listing the IDP alongside the foreign license in the visitor scenario, but it fails to state the core requirement clearly as demanded by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a86f476f-a046-4eaf-8d07-caa7ab5f773b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2797, "completion_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 2972}, "latency_s": 0.9088327499921434, "request_id": "veaUaaHnN7T4xs0P1pGa4QI", "raw_response": null}
