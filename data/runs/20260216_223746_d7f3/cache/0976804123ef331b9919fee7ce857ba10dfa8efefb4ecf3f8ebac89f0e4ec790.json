Swiss debt enforcement law (SchKG) allows for direct enforcement through the Betreibungsamt if the debtor doesn't object.\n\n**Statement ii**: Parties can normally appeal cantonal court decisions to Federal Court - This is **INCORRECT**. Appeals to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court are limited and subject to strict requirements (value thresholds, specific legal questions). It's not a \"normal\" or automatic right of appeal.\n\n**Statement iii**: Treasure on alien property and possession without knowledge in Roman law - This is **CORRECT**. This was indeed a classical Roman law question regarding whether one could possess something without knowing about it (thesaurus).\n\n**Statement iv**: One year notification requirement for fundamental error - This is **INCORRECT**. Under Swiss law (Art. 31 CO), the time limit for invoking error is one year from discovery, but the statement's formulation about \"ratification\" is misleading. The correct consequence is that the right to invoke the error is lost, not that the contract is \"deemed ratified.\"\n\n**Statement v**: Direct appeal against posters/TV spots in official campaigns as administrative decisions - This is **INCORRECT**. Information campaigns generally don't qualify as administrative decisions (Verfügungen) that can be directly appealed, as they don't create individual rights or obligations.\n\nIncorrect statements: ii, iv, and v\n\nLooking at the options, this corresponds to **Choice X: ii, iv, and v**\n\n{\"answer\": \"X\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement ii is incorrect (Federal Court appeals are limited, not normal); statement iv is incorrect (the formulation about ratification is misleading); statement v is incorrect (information campaign materials don't qualify as appealable administrative decisions). Statements i and iii are correct.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 559, "completion_tokens": 423, "total_tokens": 982}, "latency_s": 11.074711583001772, "request_id": "chatcmpl-83928a87-3493-4f40-a176-74268cdb61d7", "raw_response": null}
