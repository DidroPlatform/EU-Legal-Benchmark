The structure is logical, moving from the IT outsourcing to the Indian subsidiary establishment, and concluding with overarching recommendations. The analysis correctly identifies key legal instruments (GDPR, SCCs, UK Bribery Act, FCPA) and necessary measures (TIA, Compliance systems, awareness). The candidate answer is more detailed and structured than the reference answer, covering aspects like service models (implicitly via GDPR discussion), contractual SLAs, and corporate governance in India, which enhances the quality of the legal discussion. It correctly maps the risks to the relevant legal frameworks. The reference answer is very concise, focusing only on the core points, while the candidate provides a thorough legal opinion (Rechtsgutachten).\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.95}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3543, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 3766}, "latency_s": 1.3476407499983907, "request_id": "Y9WUaezALebgnsEP3-2VSQ", "raw_response": null}
