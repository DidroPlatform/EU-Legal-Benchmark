The candidate answer focuses almost exclusively on the 'but for' test (factual causation) and the 'chain of causation' breaking/not breaking (legal causation), citing cases like *Pagett*, *Roberts*, and *Blaue*. It does not explicitly discuss or define 'material contribution' as a distinct concept within UK criminal causation analysis, which is often relevant where multiple acts contribute to the final harm (e.g., in assault or unlawful act manslaughter contexts).
