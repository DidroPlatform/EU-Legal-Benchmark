Section 3, under the heading 'The Ad with Altered Ophelia: Direct Infringement?', explicitly discusses the chain of liability. It lists the 'Paying user' as having 'Direct: Made/used infringing copy' and then discusses the 'Ad agency/brand' as potentially liable for secondary infringement if they knew the origin, which covers the entity commissioning the ad (the fizzy drink company). This directly addresses the concept of liability for dealing with an infringing copy, even if it frames it slightly broader than just the 'fizzy drink company' specifically, it covers the user and the entity using the final ad.\", \"criterion_id\": \"cb36e543-ebdc-4d95-a81f-9170a9f5fa3c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2329, "completion_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 2541}, "latency_s": 0.9240549160167575, "request_id": "YiqVaeydOcPwnsEPpffzuQM", "raw_response": null}
