The candidate response discusses UK civil litigation rules under the section on procedural risks. It mentions costs management under CPR Part 3.12\\u20133.18 and disclosure obligations under CPR Part 31. However, it does not explicitly use the term 'proportional pre-trial discovery' or clearly state that the UK rules mandate proportionality in discovery/disclosure. While CPR Part 31.7 requires parties to limit disclosure to what is necessary to deal with the case justly, and proportionality is a key element of the overriding objective (CPR 1.1), the specific phrasing required by the criterion is absent. The response mentions 'costs budgeting' and 'disclosure obligations' but fails to explicitly link these to the concept of 'proportional pre-trial discovery' as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"92b58255-0bf8-4690-99a4-55e9abe78dd9\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4269, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 4503}, "latency_s": 1.2227444169984665, "request_id": "gkqUaa6EKLT4xs0P1pGa4QI", "raw_response": null}
