Furthermore, the U.S. section discusses Fair Use generally but does not make the specific distinction between parody and satire required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c11709a9-5dda-48c9-ac5e-05eb4cb06143\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2893, "completion_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 3071}, "latency_s": 0.9177387080271728, "request_id": "mwKVabneE6jlnsEP1bugwAM", "raw_response": null}
