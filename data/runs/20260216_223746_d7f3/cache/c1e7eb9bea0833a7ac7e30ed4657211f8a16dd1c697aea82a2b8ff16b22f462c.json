The candidate answer discusses the flexibility of GIPs to hire under private law based on the GIP's composition (public/private majority) and the nature of the work, citing case law that allows private law contracts. It does not explicitly state the default rule mentioned in the criterion: that if the main object is an SPA, public law applies by default. While the answer touches upon related concepts (core public functions requiring public law), it fails to confirm the specific default legal consequence tied to the GIP's constitutive convention defining its main object as an SPA.\", \"criterion_id\": \"18abdf2a-eb07-4ab6-872f-df2b404b1dcb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1269, "completion_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 1474}, "latency_s": 0.8014090409851633, "request_id": "evSUaZX_GNHMkdUPyI67sAQ", "raw_response": null}
