It contrasts this with the court's role in reviewing enforcement challenges under Article V, which often involves jurisdictional objections raised by the resisting party. The entire structure is built around defending the tribunal's competence (jurisdiction) and ensuring that US courts do not substitute their judgment for the tribunal's on substantive or procedural matters, thereby clearly distinguishing between the tribunal's decision-making scope and the court's limited review scope during enforcement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e92f1752-19b6-4afc-9ea1-4277c9bf6cc0\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3387, "completion_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 3575}, "latency_s": 3.4407463329844177, "request_id": "l_qUafazMoTw7M8P482J-QQ", "raw_response": null}
