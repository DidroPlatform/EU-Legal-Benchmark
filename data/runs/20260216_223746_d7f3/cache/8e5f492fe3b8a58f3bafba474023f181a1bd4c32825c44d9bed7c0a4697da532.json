The candidate answer discusses the foreign anti-arbitration injunction (Section 3) but frames the argument as *resisting* the injunction's effect, arguing it is *not* an Article V defense and that comity yields to Convention policy. It does not mention the possibility that the *existence* of a New York injunction (if one were issued by a US court, though the prompt implies the supplier seeks to resist enforcement in NY after the award) could be used as a public policy defense against recognition under Article V(2)(b). Since the prompt describes the supplier resisting enforcement in New York, the relevant public policy defense would be based on the *arbitration proceeding itself* violating US public policy, or perhaps the supplier arguing that the Paris tribunal's action in proceeding despite a *foreign* injunction violated US public policy, but the criterion specifically asks about a *New York court injunction* potentially working against recognition. The candidate answer focuses entirely on defending the award against the supplier's arguments, not on how a New York injunction might be used against recognition.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f101b285-a1a0-4537-859b-11fe9252516e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3168, "completion_tokens": 308, "total_tokens": 3476}, "latency_s": 2.1190394169534557, "request_id": "NxqVaYbdAojyxs0PwJ_VyQQ", "raw_response": null}
