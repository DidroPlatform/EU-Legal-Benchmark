The candidate answer explicitly names the Windsor Framework, links it to easing the Protocol burden, and cites the primary legal instruments adopted on 24 March 2023 (JC Decisions 1/2023 and 2/2023), which operationalised the framework following the political agreement of 27 Feb 2023. While the candidate cites 24 March 2023 for the legal decisions rather than 22 March 2023 for a specific parliamentary approval date (which is often cited for the political agreement or subsequent domestic legislation), the core elements—negotiated by the current government to ease the Protocol, resulting in an international agreement—are clearly present and supported by primary source citations that anchor the adoption timeline.\", \"criterion_id\": \"dad0e919-f700-46a6-aa9a-2b1456a237f3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4117, "completion_tokens": 254, "total_tokens": 4371}, "latency_s": 0.9132523749722168, "request_id": "fyCVaYnKMceC7M8P_tvRkAs", "raw_response": null}
