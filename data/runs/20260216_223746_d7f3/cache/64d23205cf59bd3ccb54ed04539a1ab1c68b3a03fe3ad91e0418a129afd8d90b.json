Here are the essential elements you need to cover:\n\n## 1. **Territory & Exclusivity**\n- Define exactly which parts of Canada are covered (whole country, specific provinces?)\n- Is this exclusive (only this distributor) or non-exclusive?\n- Can you sell directly to Canadian customers online?\n\n## 2. **Pricing & Payment Terms**\n- Who pays for shipping and import duties? (Look up \"Incoterms\" - likely DDP or DAP)\n- Payment currency (GBP, CAD, USD?)\n- Payment schedule and method\n- Your profit margins after all costs\n\n## 3. **Minimum Purchase Requirements**\n- Set minimum order quantities or values\n- What happens if they don't meet minimums?\n\n## 4. **Term & Termination**\n- Contract length (start with 1-2 years)\n- Notice period for termination\n- Grounds for immediate termination\n- What happens to unsold inventory when contract ends?\n\n## 5. **Product Compliance**\n- **Critical**: Who ensures products meet Canadian regulations?\n- Who handles required certifications/labeling?\n- Liability if products don't comply\n\n## 6. **Intellectual Property**\n- Protect your trademarks and brand\n- Distributor cannot modify products or use your IP elsewhere\n- What happens to your IP rights if contract ends?\n\n## 7. **Marketing & Brand Control**\n- Who controls pricing to end customers?\n- Approval rights over marketing materials\n- Brand standards they must follow\n\n## 8. **Governing Law**\n- Which country's law applies? (UK or Canadian?)\n- Where would disputes be resolved?\n\n## 9. **Warranties & Liability**\n- Who handles customer complaints and returns?\n- Product liability insurance requirements\n- Limitation of liability clauses\n\n## 🚩 **Red Flags to Watch For:**\n- Requests for exclusivity without proven track record\n- Vague termination clauses\n- You bearing all compliance/regulatory costs\n- No minimum purchase commitments from them\n\n## **Immediate Next Steps:**\n1. **Get a lawyer** experienced in international distribution (worth every penny)\n2. Research Canadian import duties and regulations for your products\n3. Verify the distributor's reputation and financial stability\n4. Understand the true landed cost of your products in Canada\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 60, "completion_tokens": 558, "total_tokens": 618}, "latency_s": 10.56476899998961, "request_id": "chatcmpl-5b9f2d74-ff8b-4250-90ba-76865765080e", "raw_response": null}
