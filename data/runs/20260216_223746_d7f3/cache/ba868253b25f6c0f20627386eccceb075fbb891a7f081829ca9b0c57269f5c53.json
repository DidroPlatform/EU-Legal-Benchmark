The candidate answer mentions that intervening acts break the chain only if they are independent and unforeseeable (citing R v Pagett) and that reasonable responses to danger do not break the chain (citing R v Roberts). However, it does not explicitly state that the *key determination* for an act being an intervening act is whether it is 'unreasonable' or 'unforeseeable' as a general principle, although this concept is embedded in the case law cited. Specifically, it discusses the truck driver's swerve as a 'reasonable response' and the drunk driver's intoxication as *not* an intervening act, but it fails to articulate the core legal test required by the criterion directly.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1428e4a3-9748-453e-a85b-e4bc4b2f0440\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1139, "completion_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 1374}, "latency_s": 0.956696916022338, "request_id": "v-CUaduONomkxN8PnqLAgQQ", "raw_response": null}
