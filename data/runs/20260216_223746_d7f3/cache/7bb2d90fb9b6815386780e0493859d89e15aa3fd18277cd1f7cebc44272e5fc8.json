The candidate answer mentions 'Deciding on residence (e.g., move to a nursing home)' under 'Personal' powers, but it does not explicitly state that the guardian *must obtain court authorization* for this action. It only lists it as a potential area of decision-making, which is usually left to the assistito's wishes unless the decree says otherwise. It fails to explicitly state the requirement for prior judicial authorization for such a significant change, which is a key component of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"25bedebd-d62e-4f63-a40a-110ddd7d1e08\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4208, "completion_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 4407}, "latency_s": 0.9084574580192566, "request_id": "ceeUacTgN-OJxN8Po4aNmAM", "raw_response": null}
