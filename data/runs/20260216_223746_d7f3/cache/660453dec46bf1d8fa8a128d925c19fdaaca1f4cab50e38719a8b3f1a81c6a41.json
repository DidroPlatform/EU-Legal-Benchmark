{"provider": "mistral_api", "model": "mistral/magistral-medium-latest", "text": "In principle, a freezing injunction issued by a UK court against a foreign company can still stand even if there is an ongoing arbitration in Singapore under the same contract. English courts have the power to grant interim relief, such as freezing injunctions, in support of arbitration proceedings, including those taking place in foreign jurisdictions.\n\nThe court would balance its jurisdiction against the arbitration clause by considering several factors:\n\n1. **Necessity of the Injunction**: The court would assess whether the freezing injunction is necessary to prevent injustice or to preserve assets that could otherwise be dissipated, making any eventual arbitration award ineffective.\n\n2. **Effectiveness of Arbitration**: The court would consider whether the arbitration proceedings in Singapore can effectively address the issue of asset preservation. If the arbitral tribunal in Singapore has the power to grant similar interim relief, the English court might be more reluctant to intervene.\n\n3. **Connection to the UK**: The court would look at the connection between the dispute and the UK. If the foreign company has assets in the UK or if the contract has some connection to the UK, the court might be more inclined to issue the injunction.\n\n4. **Principles of Comity**: The court would consider the principles of international comity and respect for the arbitration process in Singapore. It would aim to avoid interfering with the arbitration proceedings unless it is necessary to do so.\n\nIn summary, while the English courts generally support arbitration and may stay their proceedings in favor of arbitration, they retain the power to grant interim relief such as freezing injunctions when necessary. The court would carefully balance its jurisdiction with the ongoing arbitration proceedings in Singapore to ensure that justice is served without unduly interfering with the arbitration process.\n\nTherefore, the freezing injunction can still stand, but the court would make this decision based on the specific circumstances of the case and the principles outlined above.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 51, "completion_tokens": 1709, "total_tokens": 1760}, "latency_s": 49.953994459006935, "request_id": "cee18ce331a04d44afe5d54f05c5f895", "raw_response": null}
