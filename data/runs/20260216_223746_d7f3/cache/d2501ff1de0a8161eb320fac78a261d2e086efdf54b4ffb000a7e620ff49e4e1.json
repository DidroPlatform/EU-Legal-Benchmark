{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 1, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires stating that the Right of Paternity does not apply to computer programs. The candidate answer explicitly mentions the 'Moral rights violation: Your right to be identified as the creator (right of paternity) may have been breached' in the context of an AI-generated character derived from artistic work. However, the criterion is about whether the Right of Paternity *applies* to computer programs. The candidate answer discusses the right of paternity in relation to artistic work (the graphic novel/character), not computer programs. Since the prompt is about copyright infringement of an artistic work, and the candidate correctly identifies the potential breach of the right of paternity for the author of the artistic work, it does not address the specific, narrow claim in the criterion regarding computer programs. Therefore, the criterion is not satisfied as written, as the answer discusses the right of paternity concerning artistic works, not computer programs.\", \"criterion_id\": \"67d54ec5-e69e-4a9e-af9f-37c07cbdd0a8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1202, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 1431}, "latency_s": 1.1390318329795264, "request_id": "IM-UabndDOmekdUPoPLrcQ", "raw_response": null}
