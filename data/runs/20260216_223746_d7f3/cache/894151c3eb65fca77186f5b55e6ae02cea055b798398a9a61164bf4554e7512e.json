The candidate answer explicitly discusses the classification of the collected information as 'Special-category personal data \\u2013 \\u201cdata concerning health\\u201d (Article 9(1) GDPR)' in Section 1. While it specifically cites Article 9, Article 4 is the foundational article defining 'personal data' which Article 9 builds upon. Furthermore, the entire response is framed within the context of the GDPR, which inherently relies on the definitions established in Article 4. The answer clearly establishes that the data collected falls under GDPR definitions, satisfying the spirit and practical requirement of this criterion by immediately classifying the data under the relevant GDPR articles.\", \"criterion_id\": \"93592fab-e468-42d2-b0ca-05bae3f27d4d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4423, "completion_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 4636}, "latency_s": 1.0668416660046205, "request_id": "zuWUafjJBd7XvdIPsYy5uQ4", "raw_response": null}
