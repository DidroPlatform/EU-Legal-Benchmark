The candidate answer directly addresses this uncertainty by discussing the UK's Text and Data Mining (TDM) exceptions (s.29A/29B) and noting that the issue is currently being tested in court (citing *Getty v Stability AI*). It explicitly states that the application of these exceptions to commercial training is uncertain ('Maybe, but only if they had lawful access...').
