Section 5.3, specifically addressing shipments from China to NI, states: 'The shipment can only use the green lane if the importer can prove that the goods will remain in NI or be re-exported to the EU and are not on the EU risk register.' The green lane is associated with minimal scrutiny and the UK tariff treatment for intra-UK trade, contrasting with the red lane which involves EU customs declarations. This directly supports the premise that if the NI destination is proven, the goods are treated under the UK system (UK tariff rate) rather than the EU system, satisfying the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"31ba07bc-6e8b-4a21-b24c-b747c1641530\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3960, "completion_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 4173}, "latency_s": 29.466255958017427, "request_id": "gfKUaam8HPDm7M8PqbvO6QU", "raw_response": null}
