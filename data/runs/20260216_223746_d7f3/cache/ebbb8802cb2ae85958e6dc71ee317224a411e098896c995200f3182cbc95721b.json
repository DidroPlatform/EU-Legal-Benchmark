The candidate answer correctly analyzes the truck driver's negligence as *not* breaking the chain of causation because it was foreseeable, but it fails to address the specific argument required by the criterion: that the *drunk driver's swerve* itself was a reasonable reaction to an unexpected obstacle (the chair) that a reasonable person would have made. Instead, the candidate focuses on whether the drunk driver's *own* intoxication breaks the chain (which it doesn't) and whether the *second driver's* reaction breaks the chain. It does not engage with the defence that the drunk driver's reaction to the chair was reasonable/foreseeable for *any* driver, drunk or sober, which is the core of the required argument.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e6c03261-2d1c-42d6-bea6-ac11720c84cf\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2063, "completion_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 2308}, "latency_s": 1.5184994590235874, "request_id": "EP-UabX1Fvfo7M8PiZSSoQk", "raw_response": null}
