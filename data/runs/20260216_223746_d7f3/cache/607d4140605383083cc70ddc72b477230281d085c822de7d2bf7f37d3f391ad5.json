The candidate answer explicitly identifies the 'Arbitral Tribunal's Competence-Competence' as the 'Primary argument' and states that 'The arbitral tribunal had the authority to determine its own jurisdiction under the competence-competence principle'. It further supports this by citing case law and scholarly authority affirming the tribunal's role in deciding jurisdiction. Therefore, the response correctly applies and relies upon the competence-competence principle, directly contradicting the failure condition described in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9495db3e-2861-45da-a1e2-0b1f7bdac2f6\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4044, "completion_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 4222}, "latency_s": 1.1585308329958934, "request_id": "G82UadPqOKOrnsEP8_bgmQE", "raw_response": null}
