In Section 3.2, under 'Corporate-tax deductibility', it states: 'The cost is *reimbursed* to the parent – the parent can deduct the reimbursement as a service‑fee expense (subject to arm’s‑length pricing).' It further reinforces this by mentioning: 'The group must respect **transfer‑pricing** (OECD Article 9) – the fee must be at “arm’s‑length”.' This directly outlines the OECD arm's length principle as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d4be5c2e-89e3-4ab5-bb40-67b256078b26\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4801, "completion_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 4988}, "latency_s": 1.2504119169898331, "request_id": "DOmUaariEYO2xN8P9c6FqA8", "raw_response": null}
