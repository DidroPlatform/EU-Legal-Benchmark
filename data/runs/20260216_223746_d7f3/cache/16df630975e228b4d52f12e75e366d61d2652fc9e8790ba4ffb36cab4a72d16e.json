Here's what actually happens:\n\n**For goods:**\n- NI remains in the UK customs territory (Article 4 of the Protocol)\n- BUT NI applies the EU Customs Code for goods \"at risk\" of entering the EU (Article 5)\n- NI must follow EU rules on goods standards (Annex 2 of the Protocol - SPS measures, product standards, VAT on goods, etc.)\n\nSo NI businesses can access both markets, but it's not frictionless in both directions.\n\n## The \"At Risk\" Test - Your Student's Question\n\nThis is governed by **Article 5 of the Protocol** and **Joint Committee Decision No 4/2020** (as amended by Decision 1/2023).\n\n**The burden of proof structure:**\n\n**DEFAULT POSITION:** Goods are **presumed to be \"at risk\"** of entering the EU market UNLESS proven otherwise.\n\n**The Windsor Framework changed this through the \"green lane/red lane\" system:**\n\n### Red Lane (goods at risk):\n- Going to EU/Ireland\n- Commercial goods where destination cannot be verified\n- **Burden on trader:** Must prove goods are NOT at risk to use green lane\n\n### Green Lane (goods not at risk):\n- Staying in NI for final use/consumption\n- **Requires:** UK Internal Market Scheme membership (traders must register)\n- **Requires:** Trusted Trader Scheme status\n- Minimal customs processes\n\n**For goods from third countries (your China example):**\n- Coming directly to NI from China → **presumed at risk** → Red Lane → full EU customs procedures apply\n- UNLESS the importer is in the Trusted Trader scheme AND can demonstrate goods are for NI final consumption only\n- Then: Green lane, but still subject to SPS checks if applicable\n\n**Key safeguard:** Article 5(2) - if goods subsequently move to EU, UK must collect the EU tariff and remit it.\n\n## The Stormont Brake\n\nThis is the **big political prize** from Windsor Framework.\n\n**Legal basis:** Article 13(3a) and (3b) of the Protocol (inserted by Windsor Framework amendments) + **Windsor Framework (Democratic Scrutiny) Regulations 2023**\n\n**What it actually does:**\n- Gives the NI Assembly power to object to **new or amended EU rules** that would apply in NI under the Protocol\n- Requires: 30 MLAs from at least 2 parties to petition\n- UK government must then \"use best endeavours\" to raise in Joint Committee\n- Can potentially lead to UK triggering Article 16 safeguards\n\n**Critical limitations:**\n- Only applies to NEW EU rules (not existing acquis)\n- Only for rules with \"significant and lasting\" impact on everyday life\n- UK government decides whether to actually pull the brake\n- Doesn't apply to customs or SPS rules in Annex 2\n\n## Why the DUP Boycott?\n\n**Timeline:**\n- February 2022: DUP withdrew First Minister (Paul Givan) in protest at Protocol\n- May 2022: Assembly elections - Sinn Féin became largest party\n- DUP refused to nominate Deputy First Minister → no Executive could form\n- February 2023: Windsor Framework announced\n- DUP still refused (wanted more)\n- **January 2024:** DUP finally accepted after UK government published **\"Safeguarding the Union\" command paper**\n- February 2024: Assembly restored\n\n**DUP's objections:**\n1. EU law still applies in NI (diminishes sovereignty)\n2. Irish Sea border (customs checks between GB-NI)\n3. ECJ jurisdiction (Article 12 - ECJ has final say on EU law interpretation)\n4. Democratic deficit (NI has no say in EU rules it must follow)\n\n**What changed their mind:**\n- Stormont Brake (though limited)\n- \"Safeguarding the Union\" commitments on GB-NI trade\n- Political pressure (no government for 2 years)\n- Internal party pressure\n\n## The Safeguards\n\n**Against NI becoming a backdoor to EU:**\n\n1. **Trusted Trader Scheme** - only approved businesses can use green lane\n2. **UK Internal Market Scheme** - registration required\n3. **Data sharing** - UK shares customs data with EU\n4. **Physical checks** - still required for SPS goods (reduced but not eliminated)\n5. **Article 5(2) enforcement** - UK liable if goods leak to EU\n6. **EU can audit** - Joint Committee oversight\n\n**Against abuse going the other way (EU goods flooding UK via NI):**\n- Frankly, fewer safeguards\n- UK Internal Market Act 2020 guarantees NI goods access to GB\n- Relies on commercial reality (why route via NI?)\n\n## Bottom Line for Your Student\n\nNI is NOT simply a transit space with minimal scrutiny. It's a hybrid:\n- **Legally:** In UK customs territory but applying EU goods rules\n- **Practically:** Two-tier system based on destination\n- **Burden of proof:** On traders to prove goods NOT at risk (presumption of risk)\n- **Stormont Brake:** Political safety valve, legally limited\n\nThe Windsor Framework reduced friction for GB→NI trade but NI still operates under EU single market rules for goods. It's managed regulatory divergence, not eliminated borders.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 330, "completion_tokens": 1427, "total_tokens": 1757}, "latency_s": 32.18671779197757, "request_id": "chatcmpl-26d796c5-8813-4754-a051-e132c5e81ef6", "raw_response": null}
