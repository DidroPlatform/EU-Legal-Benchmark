The candidate answer explicitly addresses the 'Unreasonable Interference' section and lists several factors considered by the court: Locality (character of the neighbourhood), Duration and Frequency, Time of Day, Severity/Intensity, Malice, and Sensitivity of the Claimant (extraordinary sensitivity). While it frames the interference as 'amenity nuisance' (sensible interference) rather than explicitly contrasting it with 'physical damage' in the factor list, it clearly covers the required elements: locality, sensitivity, and the general balancing act required to establish unreasonableness.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d732e274-94d8-4fa0-8a0c-8ef5d4905abe\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2456, "completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 2658}, "latency_s": 1.013190957979532, "request_id": "Gb6UadSPD5z07M8PqPy4oQI", "raw_response": null}
