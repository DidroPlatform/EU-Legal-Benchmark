The candidate answer discusses the user's status (licensee/unlawful occupier) and the lack of rent, which suggests a lack of formal tenancy, but it does not explicitly state or explain the legal requirement that 'actual occupation' requires a degree of continuity and permanence to establish rights (like adverse possession or implied tenancy). While the answer mentions 10 years of occupation, it frames this in the context of adverse possession, which it dismisses due to lack of exclusivity and consent, rather than using it to define the nature of the occupation itself as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f0fffa23-151f-4433-8cbb-1f2067b841d8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3338, "completion_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 3530}, "latency_s": 0.9052590409992263, "request_id": "ZOWUabPBNqeW28oPyrew8QI", "raw_response": null}
