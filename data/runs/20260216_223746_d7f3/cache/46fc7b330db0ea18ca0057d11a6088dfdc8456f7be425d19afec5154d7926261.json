This directly addresses the concept that associating a copyrighted work with an external cause (like a political movement) without it being a genuine critique/parody of the work itself is a violation, which aligns with the right to integrity.\", \"criterion_id\": \"72f92aac-0d46-4c0e-a5ca-990c3e6c5a46\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4505, "completion_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 4692}, "latency_s": 0.9920960000017658, "request_id": "Y_OUadrDKoqjkdUP-qvu2QQ", "raw_response": null}
