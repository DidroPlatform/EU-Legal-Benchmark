The candidate answer mentions that the user ignored the message and that this absence weakens any claim, suggesting that ignoring contact is viewed negatively. However, it does not explicitly analyze this action as 'unreasonable non-disclosure' in a legal context, nor does it connect the failure to respond directly to the strength or weakness of a potential legal claim based on non-disclosure principles. It treats the ignoring of the message as evidence of abandonment or weakened occupation, rather than analyzing the act of non-disclosure itself.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c25d6102-2f58-499d-a2fe-b826da3bc393\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1256, "completion_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 1437}, "latency_s": 0.6741534589673392, "request_id": "IiOVaYn7JPDm7M8Po7vO6QU", "raw_response": null}
