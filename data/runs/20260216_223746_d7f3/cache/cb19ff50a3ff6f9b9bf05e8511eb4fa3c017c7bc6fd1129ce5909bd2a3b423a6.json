A bank's legal mortgage (charge) registered on title typically has priority over an unregistered or equitable interest like a constructive trust claim.\\\" The candidate answer correctly explains that the registered charge usually wins priority, which contradicts the premise of the criterion (that the response incorrectly advised automatic priority for the trust).
