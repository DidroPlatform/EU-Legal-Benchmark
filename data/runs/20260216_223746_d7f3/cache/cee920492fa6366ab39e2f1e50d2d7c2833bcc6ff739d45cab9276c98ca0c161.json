If there is any question about Belgium’s reservation status, the board will likely request confirmation through depositary/competent-authority channels.\n\nEven if Article 9(5)–(6) apply, it remains relevant that the Belgian officers, as described, **approached to request information**; the scenario does not clearly state that Belgium **ordered the vessel to stop** or **boarded** pursuant to Article 9(5). That factual nuance will matter to whether Article 9(10) (“resistance to directions”) is engaged.\n\n## 5) Overall likely decision\nBased on the Convention text, the review board will most likely:\n1. **Treat the unmarked anchored lines as the main issue** and, if supported by evidence, find a breach of **Article 5 / Annex IV**.\n2. **Record the Spanish crew’s refusal to cooperate** as an aggravating circumstance or as impeding fact-finding, but **not** as a separate breach *unless* the facts establish “resistance” to specific directions (particularly an order to stop) within the meaning of **Article 9(10)**.\n3. **Forward the report to Spain’s competent authority** for consideration/action, consistent with the scheme that Contracting Parties “*shall consider and act on reports of foreign authorised officers… on the same basis as reports of national officers*” (**Article 9(11)**).\n\nIf you would like, we can propose language for Spain’s response to the competent authority/review board focusing on (i) factual clarifications (whether there was an order to stop; whether boarding was attempted; position relative to national fishery limits), and (ii) remedial steps regarding gear-marking compliance.\n\nKind regards,  \n[Name]  \n[Title / Organisation]  \n[Contact details]", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 11696, "completion_tokens": 1238, "total_tokens": 12934}, "latency_s": 22.607460291997995, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJ4XG4FN03ZJNB6BD2DTFG", "raw_response": null}
