The candidate answer explains the shift in the burden of proof for goods moving from GB to NI (Green Lane) where they are now *presumed not* to be at risk, and notes that this presumption does not apply to goods arriving directly from third countries. It also mentions the labelling requirement for Green Lane goods. However, it does not explicitly state or discuss the unresolved issue regarding complex supply chains where raw materials enter NI and are processed into finished goods that then enter the EU, which is the specific focus of this criterion. The candidate's discussion of the 'at risk' test focuses on the shift in presumption for direct movements, not the difficulty of tracking processed goods.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4415a72c-e330-4316-a7cb-27df04119e0a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4165, "completion_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 4398}, "latency_s": 1.090827415988315, "request_id": "zMSUacrTCNrOnsEPw-rG0AM", "raw_response": null}
