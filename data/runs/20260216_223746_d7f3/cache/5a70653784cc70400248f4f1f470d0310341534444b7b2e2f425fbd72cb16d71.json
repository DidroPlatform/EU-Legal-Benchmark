The user explicitly states concern that the older daughters will 'challenge' the youngest's inheritance and medical decision-making authority, implying a desire to prevent the older daughters from receiving or controlling those aspects. The candidate answer directly addresses this by providing extensive legal strategies (new will, trust, no-contest clause, beneficiary designations) specifically designed to *prevent* challenges and ensure the youngest daughter receives the inheritance and authority, which inherently means limiting or disinheriting the older daughters from those specific rights/assets. Therefore, the answer infers the user's intent to disenfranchise the older children regarding inheritance and medical decisions.\", \"criterion_id\": \"007214ce-2874-463e-b71b-15406a88c595\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1565, "completion_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 1763}, "latency_s": 0.8281107079819776, "request_id": "1SWVaeGoNcyynsEPyd_uiAQ", "raw_response": null}
