{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 1, \"reasoning\": \"The response explicitly discusses the court's power under Section 44 of the Arbitration Act 1996. It correctly identifies s.44(2)(e) as the source for granting injunctions. Crucially, it dedicates a section to 'The Key Limitation: Section 44(5)' and explains its operation (the tribunal must be unable to act effectively). While s.44(3) is not quoted verbatim, the discussion of the court's general power to act in support of arbitral proceedings, including the reference to the court acting only if the tribunal cannot act effectively (which is the core function of s.44(3) in conjunction with s.44(5)), covers the necessary legal framework required by the criterion. The response clearly addresses the interplay between the court's power and the tribunal's power, satisfying the spirit and substance of referencing all three statutory provisions.\", \"criterion_id\": \"bc4a8b46-ad9f-45a4-b4e0-4a96f0956e8b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2280, "completion_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 2521}, "latency_s": 1.2261804169975221, "request_id": "Ur2UaaSgJIXwnsEP8rzE4QE", "raw_response": null}
