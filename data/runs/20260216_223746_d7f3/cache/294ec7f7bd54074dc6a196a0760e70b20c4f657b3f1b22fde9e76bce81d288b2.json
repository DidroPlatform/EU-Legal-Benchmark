The candidate answer states that counterclaims are 'controversial and rarely successful' and that 'Absent explicit treaty language authorizing counterclaims, tribunals must find consent in...' This strongly implies inadmissibility without express mention. However, the candidate answer then discusses *Urbaser* and *Perenco*, where jurisdiction was accepted based on broad language ('disputes concerning an investment' or 'umbrella clause') rather than explicit authorization for counterclaims. The conclusion states the counterclaim is 'Likely Outcome: Inadmissible' due to the 'Consent problem' stemming from BIT silence, but the overall analysis shows that broad language (not just explicit mention) can suffice, contradicting the strict interpretation of the criterion ('unless expressly mentioned'). Since the response acknowledges successful jurisdiction based on broad language interpretation (*Urbaser*, *Perenco*), it does not strictly assert inadmissibility *unless expressly mentioned*.\", \"criterion_id\": \"191e67ef-7b2a-4b3a-a1e2-fe9e20a8a0b8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2604, "completion_tokens": 250, "total_tokens": 2854}, "latency_s": 37.202447249990655, "request_id": "OdCUabWPEbPUvdIPx-X2oQE", "raw_response": null}
