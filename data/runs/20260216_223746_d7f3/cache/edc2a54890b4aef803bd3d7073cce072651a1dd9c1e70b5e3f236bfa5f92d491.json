{"provider": "mistral_api", "model": "mistral/magistral-medium-latest", "text": "In investor-state arbitration, the admissibility of counterclaims is determined by several jurisdictional tests. Here's an overview of the main tests and some leading cases:\n\n1. **Consent**: The tribunal must have jurisdiction over the counterclaim. This usually requires that the state has consented to such claims. In the context of a BIT that is silent on counterclaims, the tribunal will need to look at other sources of consent, such as the UNCITRAL Rules or general principles of international law.\n\n2. **Connection with the investor's claim**: The counterclaim must have a sufficient connection to the investor's original claim. This is often assessed on a case-by-case basis, but generally, the counterclaim should arise out of the same facts or circumstances as the investor's claim.\n\n3. **Applicable law**: The counterclaim must be based on a valid source of law. In this case, the counterclaim is based on domestic environmental law, which can be applied by the tribunal if it is within the scope of the dispute.\n\nSome leading cases include:\n\n- **Saluka v. Czech Republic**: The tribunal accepted the state's counterclaim because it found that the counterclaim was within the scope of the dispute and had a sufficient connection to the investor's claim.\n\n- **CMS v. Argentina**: The tribunal declined to hear the state's counterclaim because it found that the counterclaim was not within the scope of the submission to arbitration.\n\n- **Burlington v. Ecuador**: The tribunal accepted the state's counterclaim because it found that the counterclaim was within the scope of the dispute and had a sufficient connection to the investor's claim.\n\nIn your specific case, since the Brazil-Poland BIT is silent on counterclaims and the tribunal is seated under the UNCITRAL Rules, the tribunal will likely look at the connection between the counterclaim and the investor's original claim, as well as whether the counterclaim is within the scope of the submission to arbitration. The fact that the counterclaim is based on domestic environmental law may also be a factor in the tribunal's decision.\n\nTherefore, while counterclaims are not automatically admissible in investor-state arbitration, they can be accepted if they meet the jurisdictional tests of consent, connection with the investor's claim, and applicable law.\n\nFor a more detailed analysis, you may want to review the specific language of the Brazil-Poland BIT and the UNCITRAL Rules, as well as the facts of your case to determine if the counterclaim meets these tests.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 138, "completion_tokens": 1360, "total_tokens": 1498}, "latency_s": 34.649986708012875, "request_id": "96dbf400093240fda315ad538c4eaf04", "raw_response": null}
