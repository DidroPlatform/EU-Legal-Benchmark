The candidate answer explicitly addresses the 'unreasonable' element (Section 1, Element 2) and then details the factors a court considers in Section 2, including: 'Character of the neighbourhood' (addressing locality/neighbourhood character), 'Time of day' (related to the nature of the interference), 'Frequency & volume', and 'Your own use of the property' (which relates to the claimant's sensitivity/use). While it doesn't use the exact phrasing 'physical vs sensible interference' or 'C's extraordinary sensitivity,' it covers the core concepts: the nature of the locality (South Kensington), the nature of the activity (rock band), and the claimant's expectation/use of the land, which collectively satisfy the requirement to outline the multiple factors analyzed for unreasonableness.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d732e274-94d8-4fa0-8a0c-8ef5d4905abe\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3430, "completion_tokens": 259, "total_tokens": 3689}, "latency_s": 1.3069312500301749, "request_id": "TuuUacSRF5XxjrEPuIe34AI", "raw_response": null}
