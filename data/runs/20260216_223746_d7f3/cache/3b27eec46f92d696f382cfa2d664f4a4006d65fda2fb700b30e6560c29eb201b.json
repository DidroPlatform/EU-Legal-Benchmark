Choice C logically continues by introducing Article 7 of the Convention, which is the foundational legal provision governing retroactive criminal liability. This provides the necessary legal framework before analyzing specific facts. Choices A and B jump into case-specific analysis without establishing the governing legal standard first. Choice D discusses abstract review methodology but is premature without first stating the applicable legal provision. C best extends the argument by establishing the relevant legal framework.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 643, "completion_tokens": 131, "total_tokens": 774}, "latency_s": 2.1251298330025747, "request_id": "chatcmpl-4b1d2d2a-894e-4d9a-8397-63fd1ae7183d", "raw_response": null}
