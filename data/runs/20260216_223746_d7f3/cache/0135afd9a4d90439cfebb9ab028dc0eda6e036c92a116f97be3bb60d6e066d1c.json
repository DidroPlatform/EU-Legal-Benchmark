Preliminary Remarks on Applicable Law\n\nThe present case concerns a cross-border takeover scenario involving:\n- **Target**: A plc, incorporated in the United Kingdom and listed on the London Stock Exchange\n- **Acquirer**: B AG, a German entity\n- **Transaction**: Acquisition of 40% voting capital and voting rights in A plc\n\nThe applicable regulatory framework is primarily **UK takeover law**, specifically the **City Code on Takeovers and Mergers** (the \"Takeover Code\"), as the target company is UK-incorporated and listed on a UK regulated market. German law and Swiss law are not directly applicable to this takeover, though certain notification obligations may arise under German securities law for B AG.\n\n## II. Applicable Regulatory Framework\n\n### A. The UK Takeover Code\n\nThe Takeover Code applies to, inter alia, offers for public companies incorporated in the UK whose securities are admitted to trading on a UK regulated market (Introduction to the Takeover Code, para. 3(a)(i)). A plc clearly falls within this scope.\n\nThe Takeover Code is administered by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the \"Takeover Panel\") and has statutory backing under Part 28 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n### B. UK Market Abuse Regulation and Disclosure Requirements\n\nThe UK Market Abuse Regulation (UK MAR) and the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR) impose additional disclosure obligations on substantial shareholders.\n\n## III. Consequences of the 40% Acquisition\n\n### A. Mandatory Offer Obligation (Rule 9 of the Takeover Code)\n\n**Rule 9.1** of the Takeover Code provides that when:\n- any person acquires an interest in shares which (taken together with shares already held by that person and persons acting in concert with him) carry **30% or more of the voting rights** of a company subject to the Code; or\n- any person who, together with persons acting in concert with him, holds not less than 30% but not more than 50% of the voting rights and such person, or any person acting in concert with him, acquires an interest in any other shares which increases the percentage of shares carrying voting rights held by him,\n\nsuch person shall extend offers to the holders of any class of equity share capital and to the holders of any other class of transferable securities carrying voting rights.\n\n**Application to the present case:**\n\nB AG has acquired **40% of voting rights**, which exceeds the 30% threshold. Therefore, **B AG is obliged to make a mandatory offer** for all remaining shares of A plc under Rule 9.1 of the Takeover Code, unless an exemption or waiver applies.\n\n### B. Terms of the Mandatory Offer\n\n**Rule 9.5** specifies that the mandatory offer must be:\n- In **cash** (or with a cash alternative)\n- At the **highest price paid** by the offeror (or persons acting in concert) for shares in the company during the 12 months prior to the announcement of the offer\n\nThe offer must be for all remaining equity share capital and other voting securities not already held by B AG.\n\n### C. Timing Requirements\n\nUnder **Rule 9.1**, when the obligation to make a mandatory offer arises, the offeror must normally announce a firm intention to make an offer pursuant to Rule 2.7 **immediately** (i.e., without delay).\n\n**Rule 9.7** provides that the Panel must be consulted in advance where a person is seeking to acquire shares that would give rise to an obligation to make a mandatory offer.\n\n### D. Disclosure Obligations under DTR 5\n\nUnder **DTR 5.1.2R**, a person must notify the issuer of the percentage of voting rights held when the percentage reaches, exceeds or falls below certain thresholds, including **3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%** and each **1% threshold thereafter up to 100%**.\n\nB AG's acquisition of 40% clearly triggers multiple notification thresholds. The notification must be made to A plc **within two trading days** of the date on which B AG:\n- learns of the acquisition or disposal, or\n- should have learned of the acquisition or disposal (DTR 5.8.3R)\n\nA plc must then announce this information to the market within **three trading days** of receipt (DTR 5.8.12R).\n\n### E. UK Market Abuse Regulation\n\nB AG must ensure compliance with UK MAR, particularly:\n- **Article 14**: Prohibition on insider dealing\n- **Article 15**: Prohibition on market manipulation\n- **Article 17**: Disclosure of inside information\n\nIf the acquisition or intention to make a mandatory offer constitutes inside information, appropriate disclosure obligations arise.\n\n### F. Potential Exemptions and Waivers\n\n**Rule 9 Note 1** provides that the Panel may waive the requirement for a mandatory offer in certain circumstances, including where:\n- Independent shareholders approve the acquisition without a mandatory offer being made (whitewash procedure under Appendix 1)\n- The acquisition results from an inadvertent breach and the excess shareholding is disposed of promptly\n\nHowever, given that B AG has **already acquired** 40%, a whitewash waiver is unlikely to be available unless the acquisition was inadvertent and B AG promptly reduces its holding below 30%.\n\n### G. Acting in Concert Considerations\n\n**Rule 9** applies not only to shares held directly by B AG but also to shares held by persons **acting in concert** with B AG. \"Acting in concert\" is defined in the Takeover Code as persons who, pursuant to an agreement or understanding (whether formal or informal), actively cooperate to obtain or consolidate control of a company.\n\nIf B AG has acquired the 40% stake in cooperation with other parties, their combined holdings must be considered for Rule 9 purposes.\n\n## IV. German Law Considerations\n\nWhile UK law governs the takeover, certain German law obligations may arise:\n\n### A. WpHG Notification Requirements\n\nUnder the German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz, WpHG), if B AG is a German company whose shares are admitted to trading on a German regulated market, it may need to disclose its significant investment in A plc in its own financial reporting.\n\n### B. German Takeover Act (WpÜG)\n\nThe German Takeover Act does not apply to this transaction, as the target company is not a German company with securities admitted to trading on a German regulated market.\n\n## V. Consequences and Required Actions\n\n### A. Immediate Obligations\n\n1. **Mandatory Offer**: B AG must immediately announce a firm intention to make a mandatory offer under Rule 2.7 of the Takeover Code for all remaining shares of A plc.\n\n2. **Disclosure**: B AG must notify A plc of its 40% holding under DTR 5, if not already done.\n\n3. **Panel Consultation**: If B AG has not already consulted the Takeover Panel, it should do so immediately.\n\n### B. Offer Process\n\n1. **Offer Document**: B AG must prepare and publish an offer document complying with Rule 24 and Rule 25 of the Takeover Code.\n\n2. **Financing**: B AG must demonstrate that it has sufficient resources to satisfy full acceptance of the offer (Rule 24.8).\n\n3. **Timetable**: The offer must comply with the strict timetable provisions in the Takeover Code (Rules 30-32).\n\n### C. Potential Sanctions for Non-Compliance\n\nFailure to comply with the mandatory offer obligation may result in:\n- **Enforcement action** by the Takeover Panel\n- **\"Cold-shoulder\" provisions**: UK financial institutions may refuse to act for B AG\n- **Compensation orders** requiring B AG to pay compensation to shareholders\n- **Restrictions on voting rights** or requirements to divest shares\n- **Criminal sanctions** for breach of certain provisions with statutory backing\n\n## VI. Conclusion\n\nThe acquisition by B AG of 40% of the voting rights in A plc triggers a **mandatory offer obligation** under Rule 9.1 of the UK Takeover Code. B AG must immediately announce a firm intention to make an offer for all remaining shares of A plc at a price not less than the highest price paid during the preceding 12 months, with a cash alternative. B AG must also comply with disclosure obligations under DTR 5 and ensure compliance with UK MAR. Failure to comply with these obligations may result in significant regulatory sanctions and enforcement action by the Takeover Panel.\n\nThe transaction is governed primarily by UK law, given that A plc is incorporated in the UK and listed on the London Stock Exchange. German and Swiss law have limited direct application to the takeover itself, though certain ancillary obligations may arise under German law for B AG.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: This opinion assumes that B AG acquired the 40% stake in a single transaction or series of transactions that collectively triggered the Rule 9 threshold.
