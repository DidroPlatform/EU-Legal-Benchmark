{"provider": "nim", "model": "z-ai/glm5", "text": "This is a very thoughtful and important step for your friend to take. In Italy, the legal instrument used for this situation is called **Amministrazione di Sostegno (Support Administration)**. It was introduced to be a flexible, less restrictive alternative to older measures like \"interdizione\" (interdiction).\n\nHere is a breakdown of how the process works, the necessary documents, and the responsibilities involved.\n\n### 1. How the Court Decides (The Criteria)\n\nThe court’s primary goal is to protect the elderly parent while respecting their remaining autonomy. The decision lies with the **Giudice Tutelare (Tutelage Judge)** at the court in the town where the parent resides.\n\nThe judge will grant the measure if they verify two main elements:\n*   **The Condition:** The person must have an impairment (physical, mental, or psychological) or an infirmity (often due to age) that makes them unable to provide for their own interests.\n*   **The Necessity:** The impairment must be such that the person cannot manage their daily affairs, assets, or well-being without help.\n\n**The Investigation Process:**\nUnlike harsher legal measures, the judge is required to hear the elderly parent directly. The judge will visit the parent (often at home or in a hospital) to assess their mental state and understand their wishes. The judge will ask:\n*   Does the parent understand what is happening?\n*   Does the parent agree to the appointment?\n*   Does the parent have a preference for who the guardian should be?\n\nIf the parent objects strongly and retains some capacity, the judge must take those objections seriously, though the judge can proceed if it is clearly in the parent's best interest.\n\n### 2. Required Documents\n\nTo start the procedure, your friend (the applicant) must file a **Ricorso (Petition)**. While a lawyer is not strictly mandatory for this specific procedure (it can be done personally), it is highly recommended to avoid procedural errors.\n\nThe typical documents attached to the petition include:\n\n1.  **Medical Certificate:** This is the most critical piece of evidence. It must be from the parent’s treating doctor (GP) or a specialist. It should detail the diagnosis, the prognosis, and explicitly state that the person is unable to manage their affairs independently.\n2.  **Identity Documents:** Photocopies of the parent’s and the applicant’s ID cards and Codice Fiscale (Tax Code).\n3.  **Certificate of Residence:** To prove which court has jurisdiction.\n4.  **Family Status Certificate (*Stato di Famiglia*):** This lists close relatives (spouse, children, etc.). The judge needs this to ensure other close family members are informed of the proceedings.\n5.  **Asset Overview (Optional but helpful):** A list of the parent’s assets (bank accounts, property, pension amount). This helps the judge decide how broad the guardian’s powers should be.\n\n### 3. Responsibilities of the Guardian (*Amministratore di Sostegno*)\n\nOnce appointed, the guardian acts as a bridge between the parent and the world. The role is defined by the principle of **solidarity**, not total control. The guardian must act in the parent's best interest and listen to their wishes whenever possible.\n\nThe judge will issue a decree defining exactly what the guardian can do. Responsibilities generally fall into two categories:\n\n**A. Ordinary Acts (Day-to-Day Management)**\nThe guardian can usually handle these without specific court authorization for each step:\n*   Collecting the parent’s pension and paying bills (rent, utilities, nursing home fees).\n*   Buying necessary goods (food, medicine, clothing).\n*   Managing small bank transactions.\n\n**B. Extraordinary Acts (Significant Decisions)**\nFor major decisions, the guardian **must** obtain authorization from the Giudice Tutelare beforehand. This protects the parent from abuse. These acts include:\n*   Selling or buying real estate.\n*   Accepting an inheritance or renouncing a will.\n*   Taking out loans or mortgages.\n*   Major medical decisions (if the parent cannot consent), though usually, the consent of the parent is preferred if they are capable of understanding.\n\n**Accountability:**\nThe guardian must keep track of all expenses. Usually, the judge requires an annual report (*rendiconto annuale*) detailing how the money was spent.\n\n### Key Advice for Your Friend\n\n1.  **Talk to the Parent First:** If the parent is still lucid enough to understand, it is best if the parent *asks* for the guardian or *agrees* to the appointment. This makes the process much smoother and less traumatic.\n2.  **Specificity:** The petition should ask for specific powers. For example, if the parent just needs help paying bills, the guardian shouldn't ask for control over all assets.\n3.  **The \"Designation\":** If the parent had previously signed a document (like a Public Deed or a Will) designating who they wanted as a guardian in case of incapacity, the judge will almost always respect that choice.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not an Italian attorney.
