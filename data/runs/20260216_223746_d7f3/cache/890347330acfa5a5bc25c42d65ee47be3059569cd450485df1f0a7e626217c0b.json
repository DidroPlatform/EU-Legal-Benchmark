The candidate answer discusses the 100 percent dividends-received deduction (DRD) under \\u00a7245A, noting that it is available for dividends from a 10-percent-owned foreign corporation *only if* the dividend is not attributable to GILTI. While this correctly describes the interaction between \\u00a7245A and GILTI, it does not explicitly state the required negative proposition: that the \\u00a7245A participation exemption itself does not apply to GILTI inclusions. GILTI is taxed as ordinary income, and the DRD is specifically excluded for GILTI dividends, which is a related but distinct point from stating the exemption does not apply to the inclusion itself.\", \"criterion_id\": \"58f49d20-37dc-4fe5-a083-0c6b5c841774\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1986, "completion_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 2221}, "latency_s": 0.9302965000388213, "request_id": "jPKUaeHDFZmG7M8PkeL4mAM", "raw_response": null}
