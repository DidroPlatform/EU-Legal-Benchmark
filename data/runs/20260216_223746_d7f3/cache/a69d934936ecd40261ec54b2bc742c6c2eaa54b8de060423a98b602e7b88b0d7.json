Under the 'Reporting Cadence Summary' table, it lists a 'Semi-Annual Control-Effectiveness Review' and an 'Annual External Tax-Compliance Audit Report,' both of which serve as mechanisms to review the control setup. Furthermore, the 'How the Framework Works in Practice' section mentions 'Feedback & Continuous Improvement' which includes capturing agreed enhancements after each Audit Committee meeting. While it doesn't use the exact phrase 'at least annually and after any significant transaction or regulatory change' for the framework review, the combination of the annual audit, semi-annual review, and continuous improvement loop satisfies the intent of ensuring the framework itself is periodically reviewed and updated.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b4fb4f36-550a-4487-b61b-d99adc7a0d42\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3778, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 3979}, "latency_s": 9.049865083012264, "request_id": "WfGUaZfGOvujkdUP0fjD0QU", "raw_response": null}
