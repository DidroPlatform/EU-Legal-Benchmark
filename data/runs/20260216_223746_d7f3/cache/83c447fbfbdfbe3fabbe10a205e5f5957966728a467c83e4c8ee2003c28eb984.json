While this touches upon location and function alignment, it does not explicitly mention the Barbados Substance/DPT context or specifically state that the KPI measures alignment of SPFs/Value Creation Activities *instead of* relying solely on headcount, as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"88c3cdf9-5713-440a-9aac-76b2bbc405a1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3735, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 3936}, "latency_s": 0.9021947919973172, "request_id": "nh-VaambL8Pe7M8PidibyAM", "raw_response": null}
