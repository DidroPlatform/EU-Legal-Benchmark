The candidate answer discusses the drunk driver's conduct potentially breaking the chain of causation for the truck driver, focusing on whether the swerve was 'extraordinary' or 'unforeseeable' due to intoxication and swerving into another car. It does not explicitly address the scenario where the drunk driver's action is deemed *not negligent* (i.e., a reasonable person would have done the same) and what the consequence of that specific finding would be for the truck driver's liability (i.e., total liability). The analysis focuses on the drunk driver's *grossly negligent/reckless* conduct being a potential novus actus, not the opposite scenario where the drunk driver's reaction is deemed reasonable/non-negligent.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ff67bf61-062a-4cca-acf8-5003202b85d7\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1787, "completion_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 2034}, "latency_s": 0.9804114170256071, "request_id": "lR6VaZSvOafx7M8PiZPD-AQ", "raw_response": null}
