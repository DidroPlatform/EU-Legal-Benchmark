The matter concerns potential violations of the **Convention on Conduct of Fishing Operations in the North Atlantic** (the \"Convention\"), to which both Spain and Belgium are Contracting Parties.\n\n### **Factual Background**\n1. **Observed Violation**: Belgian authorized officers identified lines anchored in the sea that were **not marked** in accordance with **Article 5** of the Convention, which requires gear to be marked to indicate its position and extent (see **Annex IV** for specific marking requirements).\n2. **Refusal to Cooperate**: Upon approaching the Spanish vessel to request information, the Spanish officers on board **refused to cooperate** with the Belgian officers. This refusal was subsequently reported to the review board as a further violation of Spain’s obligations under the Convention.\n\n### **Legal Analysis**\n#### **1. Violation of Article 5 (Marking of Gear)**\n- **Article 5** mandates that nets, lines, and other gear anchored in the sea must be marked to indicate their position and extent. The failure to mark the lines constitutes a **prima facie violation** of this provision.\n- **Annex IV, Rule 1** specifies that anchored gear must be fitted with **flag or radar reflector buoys by day and light buoys by night**, sufficient to indicate its position and extent. The absence of such markings is a clear breach of the Convention.\n\n#### **2. Violation of Article 9 (Duties of Authorized Officers and Cooperation)**\n- **Article 9(4)** requires authorized officers to **observe, inquire, and report on infringements** of the Convention and to **cooperate with authorized officers of other Contracting Parties** for these purposes.\n- **Article 9(11)** obliges Contracting Parties to **consider and act on reports of foreign authorized officers** on the same basis as reports of national officers. While this does not impose an obligation to give foreign reports higher evidential value, it does require **good-faith engagement** with such reports.\n- The **refusal to cooperate** with the Belgian officers, including the failure to provide requested information, constitutes a **separate violation** of the Convention. This is particularly egregious given the explicit duty under **Article 9(4)** to cooperate and the requirement under **Article 9(5)** for authorized officers to **seek information** where a breach is suspected.\n\n#### **3. Spain’s Reservations Under Article 14**\n- Spain made a **reservation** to **Article 9(5) and (6)** upon ratification of the Convention, stating that these paragraphs would not bind it with respect to Contracting Parties that had made similar reservations. However:\n  - Belgium has **not made a reservation** to Article 9(5) or (6). Therefore, Spain’s reservation does not apply to Belgium, and Spain remains **fully bound** by these provisions in its dealings with Belgian authorized officers.\n  - The refusal to cooperate extends beyond the scope of Article 9(5) and (6) and implicates **Article 9(4)**, to which **no reservation applies**. Thus, the refusal to cooperate violates the Convention regardless of Spain’s reservation.\n\n### **Likely Decision of the Review Board**\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the review board is likely to conclude the following:\n\n1. **Violation of Article 5**: The Spanish vessel **failed to mark its anchored gear** in accordance with Article 5 and Annex IV, constituting a breach of the Convention.\n2. **Violation of Article 9(4)**: The **refusal to cooperate** with the Belgian authorized officers violates Spain’s obligation under Article 9(4) to cooperate in the observation and reporting of infringements.\n3. **No Valid Defense Based on Reservations**: Spain’s reservation to Article 9(5) and (6) does not apply to Belgium, and the refusal to cooperate also violates Article 9(4), which is not subject to reservation.\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\nTo comply with the Convention and avoid further escalation, we recommend the following:\n1. **Acknowledge the Violations**: Spain should acknowledge the failure to mark the gear and the refusal to cooperate with the Belgian officers.\n2. **Provide Assurances of Future Compliance**: Spain should provide assurances that its vessels will comply with the marking requirements under Article 5 and the cooperation obligations under Article 9.\n3. **Facilitate Further Inquiry**: If the review board proceeds to a formal hearing, Spain should cooperate fully with the process, including providing any requested documentation or testimony.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe review board is likely to find that Spain, through its vessel, **violated both Article 5 and Article 9(4)** of the Convention. We urge Spain to take corrective action to ensure compliance with its obligations under the Convention and to avoid similar incidents in the future.\n\nShould you wish to discuss this matter further or provide additional information, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nYours sincerely,\n[Name and Title]\n[Review Board or Designated Authority]\n[Contact Information]\n\n---", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 12783, "completion_tokens": 1189, "total_tokens": 13972}, "latency_s": 36.07743958401261, "request_id": "5a14baf214064ad39334cfa0c32c68ab", "raw_response": null}
