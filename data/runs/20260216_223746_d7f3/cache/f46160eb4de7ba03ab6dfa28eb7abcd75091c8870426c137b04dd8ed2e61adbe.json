Specifically, under Section 2 ('Threat of German Court Proceedings'), it discusses the potential for German courts to assert jurisdiction but immediately counters this by analyzing the effect of the London seat, the potential for an Anti-Suit Injunction (ASI) from the English High Court to restrain vexatious proceedings, and the obligation of German courts to stay proceedings under principles related to the arbitration agreement (though referencing Brussels Ia Lis Pendens, the core point is that the arbitration agreement should prevail). The strategy section also includes 'Anti-German Court Tactics,' explicitly mentioning sending a cease-and-desist and applying for an ASI, which directly supports the criterion that a German court should dismiss or stay the action because the filing would be a breach of the arbitration agreement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"50faad98-d961-4c12-a76b-ce59b94c7973\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2071, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 2294}, "latency_s": 29.28138795803534, "request_id": "8DGVaZu4Lcjl7M8P9OOViAY", "raw_response": null}
