General Electric* (2d Cir. 2007): arbitrators have authority to decide their own jurisdiction (\"Kompetenz-Kompetenz\"), and courts review this narrowly\n   - The Paris tribunal's determination of its own jurisdiction receives substantial deference unless manifestly irrational\n\n2. **Separability doctrine**\n   - The arbitration clause is severable from the underlying contract\n   - Even if the contract itself is challenged, the arbitration agreement typically survives\n   - This undermines arguments that the tribunal lacked foundational authority\n\n3. **Waiver/estoppel**\n   - If the US supplier participated in the Paris proceedings without timely objecting to jurisdiction, this weighs heavily against enforcement resistance\n   - *Karaha Bodas v. Perusahaan* (2d Cir. 2006): participation without objection can constitute waiver\n\n## Addressing Due Process Claims Under Article V(1)(b)\n\nThis is your more vulnerable point. Article V(1)(b) permits non-enforcement if the party \"was not given proper notice... or was otherwise unable to present its case.\"\n\n**Your defensive arguments:**\n\n1. **High threshold for due process violations**\n   - US courts interpret Article V(1)(b) narrowly; mere procedural irregularities don't suffice\n   - *Parsons & Whittemore v. Société Générale* (2d Cir. 1974): the Convention contemplates only \"serious departures\" from fundamental fairness\n   - The injunction itself doesn't necessarily constitute a due process violation if the supplier had notice and opportunity to be heard\n\n2. **Notice and opportunity to participate**\n   - Document that the supplier received proper notice of the arbitration\n   - Show it participated (or had opportunity to participate) in the proceedings\n   - Demonstrate it presented evidence and arguments on the merits\n   - *Enersis S.A. v. Andes* (2d Cir. 2003): actual participation cures most notice defects\n\n3. **Injunction ≠ denial of due process**\n   - The injunction was issued by a court of competent jurisdiction (presumably French)\n   - The supplier could have challenged it through French procedures\n   - US courts don't typically second-guess foreign court orders as due process violations\n   - *Chromalloy v. Egypt* (D.D.C. 1997): US courts won't reexamine foreign judicial decisions on due process grounds\n\n4. **Contractual choice of law and forum**\n   - If the contract specified Paris arbitration, the supplier accepted the procedural framework\n   - Sophisticated commercial parties are held to their agreements\n   - *Mitsubishi Motors v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth* (US 1985): arbitration agreements are enforceable even in international commercial disputes\n\n## Precedents Supporting Deference\n\n**Key authorities:**\n\n- **Second Circuit's framework** (*Vivendi*, *Enersis*): Very deferential review; Article V defenses are construed narrowly\n  \n- **Supreme Court trajectory** (*Mitsubishi*, *Buckeye Check*, *Rent-A-Center*): Strong pro-arbitration policy; arbitration clauses receive favorable treatment\n\n- **Scholarly consensus**: The Restatement (Third) of the U.S. Law of International Commercial Arbitration (ALI, 2019) emphasizes that Article V defenses are \"narrow exceptions\" to enforcement\n\n- **Comparative law**: Most major jurisdictions (UK, Singapore, Hong Kong) follow similarly deferential approaches\n\n## Practical Vulnerabilities to Address\n\n**Anticipate these counterarguments:**\n\n1. **The injunction as a \"serious departure\"**\n   - The supplier may argue the injunction prevented meaningful participation\n   - Counter: Show the supplier had notice and could have sought to lift/modify it through French courts\n   - Emphasize that the tribunal proceeded with proper notice\n\n2. **Arbitrator bias or manifest disregard**\n   - Article V(1)(e) permits non-enforcement for \"corruption, fraud or bribery\"\n   - This is extremely difficult to prove but watch for any appearance of impropriety\n   - Ensure the award doesn't show obvious irrationality that might suggest bias\n\n3. **Lack of arbitrability**\n   - Some claims (antitrust, securities fraud) have historically raised arbitrability questions\n   - Verify your underlying dispute doesn't implicate non-arbitrable issues\n   - Modern US law is very permissive on arbitrability\n\n## Strategic Recommendations\n\n1. **Prepare a detailed procedural record** showing the supplier's notice and participation opportunities\n\n2. **Obtain affidavits** from tribunal counsel or the tribunal itself (if possible) confirming proper notice and procedure\n\n3. **Research French law** on the injunction—if it was properly issued under French law, this strengthens your position\n\n4. **Distinguish *Chromalloy*-type cases** where the foreign court actually annulled the award; here, the injunction merely constrained proceedings, not the award itself\n\n5. **Consider settlement leverage**: Enforcement is likely, but litigation costs are real; the supplier's defenses are weak but not frivolous\n\nThe Second Circuit's strong pro-enforcement stance (where most international arbitration cases are litigated) is substantially in your favor.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 124, "completion_tokens": 1279, "total_tokens": 1403}, "latency_s": 13.717018833005568, "request_id": "chatcmpl-45dc2cf7-9cbe-44db-b749-e0484c147fa8", "raw_response": null}
