The candidate answer discusses the 'Green Lane' and 'Red Lane' system under the Windsor Framework, stating that green lane goods are 'intended to stay in NI' and that traders must certify that those goods are *not* intended for onward movement into the EU. However, it does not explicitly mention the 'UK Internal Market Scheme (UKIMS)' or state that the goods must be *labeled* 'Not for EU'.
