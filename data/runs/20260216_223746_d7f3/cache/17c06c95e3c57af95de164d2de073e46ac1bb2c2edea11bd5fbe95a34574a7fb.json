The candidate answer explicitly addresses the correspondence with the buyer in Section 4.A ('What to look for'): 'Correspondence with the buyer (the text asking if you still live there, any later messages) - Shows you have been in contact and can be used to prove you were aware of the sale.' Furthermore, in Section 4.B ('Request a formal notice'), it advises the user to write to the buyer, implying that the user's previous silence should be rectified by formal communication now. While it doesn't use the exact phrase 'unreasonable non-disclosure,' it analyzes the relevance of the ignored text message in the context of the user's overall legal position and subsequent required actions, satisfying the intent of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c25d6102-2f58-499d-a2fe-b826da3bc393\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3344, "completion_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 3574}, "latency_s": 0.8262791670276783, "request_id": "guWUaZebNciAxN8P0-6JCA", "raw_response": null}
