The candidate answer discusses the court's discretion extensively, focusing on Section 44 of the Arbitration Act 1996, the tribunal's powers, and the seat of arbitration (Singapore). While it does not explicitly use the phrase 'governing law provisions,' it discusses the 'Seat of arbitration considerations' and whether it is appropriate for the English court to act given the foreign seat, which is a key aspect of private international law that dictates which jurisdiction's procedural rules (including those related to interim relief) apply or influence the English court's discretion. More directly, the entire analysis hinges on the court's discretion under the Arbitration Act 1996, which is inherently influenced by the contractual choice of arbitration seat and governing law (though the latter is often less relevant for interim relief than the seat itself). Given the depth of analysis on jurisdictional influence and discretion, this criterion is substantially met by discussing the seat of arbitration's impact on discretion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8b9ea1c1-5d76-4999-98af-31210a326714\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2267, "completion_tokens": 279, "total_tokens": 2546}, "latency_s": 1.3807691670081113, "request_id": "er2UaabhKr3ukdUPjeSHsAM", "raw_response": null}
