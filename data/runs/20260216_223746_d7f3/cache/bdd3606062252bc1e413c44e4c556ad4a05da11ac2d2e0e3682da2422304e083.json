T AG transfers a patent at book value (500k) to M AG (fair value 750k). In year n+2, M AG sells T AG. Under Swiss tax law (Art. 61 DBG), intra-group transfers can be tax-neutral (Umstrukturierung/transposition). However, the key condition for tax-neutral transfers within a group is typically a holding period (Sperrfrist) of 5 years. Since M AG sells T AG in n+2 (only 2 years later), the hidden reserves should be taxed retroactively. The statement says \"über sie wird auch nachträglich nicht steuerlich abgerechnet\" (no retroactive taxation) - this is **FALSE**. The violation of the holding period should trigger retroactive taxation.\n\n**ii.** A carpentry business sells two investment properties and buys a warehouse needed for operations. Under Art. 30 DBG (Ersatzbeschaffung/replacement acquisition), replacement of business assets can qualify for tax deferral. However, the replacement must be of \"like-kind\" - investment properties replaced by operational property may qualify since both are business assets (betriebliches Anlagevermögen). Actually, properties serving as capital investment (Vermögensanlage) vs. operational use - the replacement acquisition rules under Swiss tax law require functional equivalence. Replacing investment properties with an operational warehouse is not functionally equivalent, so Ersatzbeschaffung would NOT apply. Wait - actually under Art. 30 DBG, replacement acquisition applies to \"betriebsnotwendiges Anlagevermögen.\" Investment properties (Vermögensanlage) are typically NOT betriebsnotwendig. So the proceeds from selling non-essential assets cannot be deferred through replacement acquisition into operational assets. The statement implies this would qualify - but actually the statement just describes a fact without making a legal claim. Re-reading: the statement just describes the transaction. There's no explicit legal conclusion stated. Hmm, but the question asks which statements are false. The statement as presented seems to imply Ersatzbeschaffung applies, but investment properties are not betriebsnotwendig, so this wouldn't qualify. This seems like a **potentially misleading but factual description** - actually it's just stating facts, not making a legal claim. So it's not false per se. Let me reconsider - the question likely tests whether this qualifies for Ersatzbeschaffung. Since it's just a factual statement without a legal conclusion, it might be considered TRUE as stated.\n\n**iii.** For listed securities, Aufwertung (write-up) is mandatory under OR 960b if previously written down below acquisition cost and market value has recovered. So saying it's \"freiwillig\" (voluntary) is **FALSE** - it's mandatory (Zuschreibungspflicht) for listed securities up to acquisition cost.\n\n**iv.** The Vermögensstandesvergleich: The formula is Profit = End equity - Start equity + withdrawals - contributions. The statement says profit should be \"increased by capital contributions and decreased by withdrawals\" - this is **BACKWARDS**. It should be increased by withdrawals and decreased by contributions. This is **FALSE**.\n\n**v.** Can tax authorities revisit previously accepted depreciation? Under the Massgeblichkeitsprinzip and practice, once depreciation is accepted, authorities generally cannot come back to it later. However, there are exceptions (e.g., if depreciation was clearly excessive). The statement says they can NEVER come back - this is generally considered **TRUE** in Swiss tax law (principle of Abschreibungsverbot rückgängig zu machen). Actually, this is a nuanced point. The statement appears to be **TRUE** as a general principle.\n\nSo false statements: i, iii, iv → **F**\n\n{\"answer\": \"F\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement i is false because selling T AG within the 5-year holding period (Sperrfrist) should trigger retroactive taxation of the hidden reserves. Statement iii is false because for listed securities, write-ups (Aufwertung) are mandatory under OR 960b, not voluntary. Statement iv is false because the formula is backwards - profit from Vermögensstandesvergleich must be increased by capital withdrawals and decreased by capital contributions, not the other way around. Statement ii is just a factual description, and statement v correctly states the general principle that tax authorities cannot revisit accepted depreciation.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 790, "completion_tokens": 1027, "total_tokens": 1817}, "latency_s": 24.893733624980086, "request_id": "chatcmpl-02d10904-f354-452d-a504-51b94eaa91bd", "raw_response": null}
