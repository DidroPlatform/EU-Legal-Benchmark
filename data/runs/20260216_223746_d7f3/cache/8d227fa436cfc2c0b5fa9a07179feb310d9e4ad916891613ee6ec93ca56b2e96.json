The candidate answer discusses secondary infringement under Section 23 CDPA 1988 and correctly states the requirement: \\\"provided they knew or had reason to believe the article was an infringing copy.\\\" However, the criterion specifically asks about the *fizzy drink company* in relation to the *ad copy*. The candidate discusses the liability of the drink company under s.23, but then immediately pivots to the moral rights (s.77/s.80) regarding the character appropriation, without explicitly linking the 'knew or had reason to believe' standard back to the fizzy drink company's liability for using the infringing image in the advert. While the legal standard is stated in the context of secondary infringement generally, it is not explicitly applied to the fizzy drink company's liability for the advert as required by the prompt's focus on secondary infringement concerning the ad.\", \"criterion_id\": \"02af10b1-fa24-413b-83c6-99edfcdf7c8c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3483, "completion_tokens": 269, "total_tokens": 3752}, "latency_s": 1.589435624977341, "request_id": "JsCUaYTUAvCMkdUPpaWNwAE", "raw_response": null}
