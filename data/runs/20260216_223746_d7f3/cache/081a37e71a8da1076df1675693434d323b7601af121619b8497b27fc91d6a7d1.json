The candidate answer mentions 'GST/HST' and 'provincial sales tax (PST)' in the context of Incoterms (Clause 6) and mentions 'Tax & Duties' in the practical steps (Step G), but it does not explicitly list 'tax payment terms and conditions' as a required contractual clause in the main checklist or the detailed guide, unlike Clause 5 which covers 'Pricing & Payment Terms' (currency, invoicing, late payment interest). While taxes are mentioned in relation to delivery/duties, the specific contractual term regarding the *payment terms and conditions* for taxes themselves is not clearly isolated as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b46b7cfb-5908-49f9-9de8-8741d5f6ff20\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4331, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 4532}, "latency_s": 1.043661792005878, "request_id": "c-aUaZGtA5G6xN8PvKnb-Qw", "raw_response": null}
