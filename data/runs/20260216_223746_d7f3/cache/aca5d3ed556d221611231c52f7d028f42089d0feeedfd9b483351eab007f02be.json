It addresses the jurisdictional challenge (Art. V(1)(c)) by focusing on the *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* principle and the deferential standard US courts apply to the tribunal's own jurisdictional findings (citing *First Options* and Born). It explicitly contrasts this with merits review by stating that courts 'do not re-litigate merits or procedure unless fundamentally unfair' and that discovery should be limited to oppose supplier's evidence as 'impermissible \\\"merits\\\" review.' This directly satisfies the requirement to distinguish between the two types of review.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e92f1752-19b6-4afc-9ea1-4277c9bf6cc0\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2026, "completion_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 2201}, "latency_s": 0.6763909579603933, "request_id": "ryiVac36K67pnsEP2M6v6QU", "raw_response": null}
