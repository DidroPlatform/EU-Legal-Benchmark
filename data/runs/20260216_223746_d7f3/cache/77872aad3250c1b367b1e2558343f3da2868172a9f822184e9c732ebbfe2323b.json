Below is a comprehensive framework for defending recognition of the award in US federal court, addressing each likely ground of resistance and marshaling the doctrinal, jurisprudential, and scholarly support available.\n\n---\n\n## I. Framing the Procedural Posture\n\nYour opponent will move to **deny recognition** under **Article V of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958)** (\"New York Convention\"), implemented in the US through **Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 201–208**. The burden of proving a ground for refusal rests **on the party resisting enforcement** — this is a critical structural advantage.\n\nThe two principal objections you anticipate are:\n\n1. **Article V(1)(a) or V(1)(c)** — lack of jurisdiction / invalidity of the arbitration agreement or the tribunal exceeding its mandate.\n2. **Article V(2)(b)** — public policy, framed as a \"due process\" violation because the tribunal proceeded despite a US court injunction.\n\nA subsidiary argument may arise under **Article V(1)(e)** — that the award has been \"set aside\" or is not yet binding — though this is unlikely unless proceedings are initiated at the seat (Paris).\n\n---\n\n## II. Defending Against the \"Lack of Jurisdiction\" Objection\n\n### A. Competence-Competence (Kompetenz-Kompetenz)\n\nThe foundational argument is that the **arbitral tribunal itself had the authority to determine its own jurisdiction**, and it did so affirmatively by proceeding to render the award.\n\n- Under **French arbitration law** (the law of the seat), the principle of competence-competence is codified in **Article 1465 of the French Code of Civil Procedure**: *\"The arbitral tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction to rule on objections to its own jurisdiction.\"*\n- The **ICC Rules** (assuming ICC arbitration, given Paris seat) similarly empower the tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction (Article 6(5) ICC Rules 2021).\n- US courts have recognized this principle. In **First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938 (1995)**, the Supreme Court held that where parties clearly and unmistakably delegate jurisdictional questions to arbitrators, courts must defer.\n\n**Strategic point:** If the arbitration clause contains broad language (e.g., \"any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract\") and incorporates institutional rules that empower the tribunal to rule on jurisdiction, argue that the parties **delegated** the jurisdictional question to the tribunal.\n\n### B. Separability of the Arbitration Clause\n\nIf the opponent argues that the underlying contract is invalid or that the arbitration clause is vitiated:\n\n- **Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440 (2006)**: The arbitration clause is severable from the main contract; challenges to the contract as a whole do not defeat the arbitration clause.\n- Under French law, the principle of **autonomy of the arbitration clause** is even more robust — the clause survives nullity of the main contract (**Gosset, Cass. civ. 1re, 7 May 1963**; codified in Article 1447 CPC).\n\n### C. The Scope of Judicial Review at the Enforcement Stage Is Narrow\n\nUS courts conducting enforcement review under the New York Convention do **not** conduct a de novo review of the tribunal's jurisdictional findings. The review is limited:\n\n- **Dallah Real Estate & Tourism Holding Co. v. Ministry of Religious Affairs of Pakistan [2010] UKSC 46** (UK Supreme Court) is sometimes cited for the proposition that enforcement courts can independently review jurisdiction — but this is the **minority approach** internationally and has been criticized.\n- The **dominant US approach** is more deferential. See **Encyclopaedia Universalis S.A. v. Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., 403 F.3d 85 (2d Cir. 2005)**: The Second Circuit applied a deferential standard to the tribunal's jurisdictional determination.\n- **Publicis Communication v. True North Communications, 206 F.3d 725 (7th Cir. 2000)**: Confirmed that US courts should not lightly refuse enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.\n\n---\n\n## III. Defending Against the \"Due Process / Public Policy\" Objection\n\nThis is the more delicate argument. The opponent will contend that the tribunal's decision to proceed **in defiance of a US court anti-arbitration injunction** constitutes a violation of due process and US public policy under **Article V(2)(b)**.\n\n### A. The Anti-Arbitration Injunction Was Itself Improper\n\nThe first line of defense is to **attack the legitimacy of the injunction itself**:\n\n1. **Strong federal policy favoring arbitration.** The US Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized this policy. **Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614 (1985)**; **Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U.S. 506 (1974)**.\n\n2. **Anti-arbitration injunctions are disfavored.** Courts have held that injunctions restraining foreign-seated arbitrations should be granted only in **extraordinary circumstances**:\n   - **Paramedics Electromedicina Comercial Ltda. v. GE Medical Systems Information Technologies, Inc., 369 F.3d 645 (2d Cir. 2004)**: The Second Circuit vacated an anti-arbitration injunction, holding that the proper course was to allow the arbitration to proceed and raise objections at the enforcement stage.\n   - This case is **directly on point** and extremely favorable: the court explicitly stated that the New York Convention's enforcement/refusal mechanism is the **appropriate checkpoint**, not pre-emptive injunctive relief.\n\n3. **Comity considerations.** A US court enjoining a Paris-seated arbitration raises serious concerns about **international comity**. The arbitral seat's supervisory courts (French courts) have primary jurisdiction over the arbitral process. **Karaha Bodas Co. v. Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, 335 F.3d 357 (5th Cir. 2003)** — the Fifth Circuit emphasized deference to the courts of the arbitral seat.\n\n**Argument:** The injunction was improvidently granted, contrary to prevailing US appellate authority, and therefore cannot serve as the foundation for a public policy defense.\n\n### B. The Tribunal Was Not Bound by the US Injunction\n\nThis is a critical point of international arbitration law:\n\n1. **An arbitral tribunal seated in Paris is governed by French procedural law, not US procedural law.** The tribunal's obligation is to the **lex arbitri** (French law) and the applicable institutional rules, not to the judicial orders of a court in a different jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Arbitral tribunals are not organs of any state.** They derive their authority from the **parties' agreement** and the **law of the seat**, not from the judicial apparatus of any particular country. This is a foundational principle articulated by:\n   - **Emmanuel Gaillard, Legal Theory of International Arbitration (2010)** — distinguishing the \"seat theory,\" the \"delocalized theory,\" and the \"pluralistic theory,\" all of which support the proposition that a tribunal is not subordinate to courts outside the seat.\n   - **Julian D.M. Lew, Loukas A. Mistelis & Stefan M. Kröll, Comparative International Commercial Arbitration (2003)**, Chapter 12 — tribunals are bound by the procedural framework of the seat, not by foreign court orders.\n\n3. **French law specifically protects the tribunal's autonomy.** Under the **1981 reforms** and subsequent codification, French arbitration law is among the most arbitration-friendly in the world. The **Cour de cassation** has consistently held that international arbitral awards are part of an **autonomous international legal order** not anchored to any single national system. See **Putrabali, Cass. civ. 1re, 29 June 2007**: An award is an \"international judicial decision\" whose validity is assessed independently by each enforcement jurisdiction.\n\n### C. The \"Public Policy\" Exception Is Construed Extremely Narrowly\n\nUS courts have consistently held that the public policy defense under Article V(2)(b) is reserved for the most **fundamental** violations:\n\n1. **Parsons & Whittemore Overseas Co. v. Société Générale de l'Industrie du Papier (RAKTA), 508 F.2d 969 (2d Cir. 1974)** — the seminal case:\n   > \"Enforcement of foreign arbitral awards may be denied on [public policy] grounds only where enforcement would violate the forum state's most basic notions of morality and justice.\"\n\n   The court rejected a public policy defense based on US foreign policy toward Egypt. This sets an **extremely high bar**.\n\n2. **Europcar Italia S.p.A. v. Maiellano Tours, Inc., 156 F.3d 310 (2d Cir. 1998)**: Confirmed the narrow construction.\n\n3. **Belize Social Development Ltd. v. Government of Belize, 668 F.3d 724 (D.C. Cir. 2012)**: Public policy must rise to the level of violating \"the most fundamental notions of morality and justice of the United States.\"\n\n**Argument:** The mere fact that a foreign tribunal declined to comply with a US court injunction — an injunction that was itself contrary to prevailing US appellate authority on anti-arbitration injunctions — does not rise to the level of a fundamental violation of US public policy. The respondent had full opportunity to participate in the arbitration, present its case, and challenge jurisdiction before the tribunal. There was no deprivation of **procedural fairness** in any meaningful sense.\n\n### D. Distinguish \"Due Process\" from \"Compliance with a Court Order\"\n\nThe opponent may conflate two distinct concepts:\n\n- **Due process** under Article V(1)(b) requires that a party was given **proper notice** and an **opportunity to present its case**. If the US supplier was notified of the arbitration, was invited to participate, and either participated or chose not to, there is **no due process violation**. See **Iran Aircraft Industries v. Avco Corp., 980 F.2d 141 (2d Cir. 1992)**.\n\n- **Non-compliance with a foreign court injunction** is a different matter entirely and does not automatically constitute a due process violation. The tribunal's decision to proceed is a **jurisdictional and procedural determination** governed by the law of the seat.\n\n---\n\n## IV. Addressing Article V(1)(e) — Award Set Aside at the Seat\n\nIf the opponent has not sought annulment in France, this ground is unavailable. If they do seek annulment:\n\n- Under French law, the grounds for annulment of an international arbitral award are **extremely limited** (Article 1520 CPC) and French courts are famously reluctant to set aside international awards.\n- Even if annulment proceedings are pending, the US enforcement court has **discretion** to proceed. **Chromalloy Aeroservices v. Arab Republic of Egypt, 939 F. Supp. 907 (D.D.C. 1996)** — the court enforced an award that had been set aside in Egypt, reasoning that the New York Convention provides a **floor**, not a ceiling, for enforcement.\n- **PEMEX v. Corporación Mexicana de Mantenimiento Integral (Commisa), 832 F.3d 92 (2d Cir. 2016)**: The Second Circuit declined to enforce an award set aside in Mexico, but distinguished the case on the ground that the Mexican annulment was based on legitimate public policy grounds. This case cuts both ways but can be distinguished if the French courts do not annul.\n\n---\n\n## V. Affirmative Arguments for Enforcement\n\nBeyond rebutting the opponent's defenses, affirmatively argue:\n\n### A. Pro-Enforcement Bias of the New York Convention\n\nThe Convention's **object and purpose** is to facilitate enforcement. The grounds for refusal in Article V are **exhaustive** and **narrowly construed**. The US Supreme Court has recognized this:\n\n- **BG Group PLC v. Republic of Argentina, 572 U.S. 25 (2014)**: Reaffirmed the strong presumption in favor of international arbitration.\n\n### B. The Federal Arbitration Act's Pro-Arbitration Policy\n\n- **9 U.S.C. § 207** provides that a court \"**shall** confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said Convention.\" The word \"shall\" creates a **mandatory presumption** of confirmation.\n\n### C. International Comity and the Autonomy of the Arbitral Seat\n\n- Refusing enforcement because a US court issued an injunction that a Paris-seated tribunal disregarded would effectively allow **unilateral US judicial control** over foreign arbitral proceedings — a result fundamentally at odds with the multilateral framework of the New York Convention.\n- **Gary Born, International Commercial Arbitration (3rd ed., 2021)**, Chapter 26: Extensively argues that enforcement courts should not second-guess the procedural decisions of tribunals seated in other Convention states, absent fundamental procedural unfairness.\n\n---\n\n## VI. Scholarly Support\n\n| Scholar / Source | Key Proposition |\n|---|---|\n| **Gary Born**, *International Commercial Arbitration* (3rd ed.) | Enforcement courts should apply a deferential standard; anti-arbitration injunctions from non-seat courts are generally improper |\n| **Emmanuel Gaillard**, *Legal Theory of International Arbitration* | Awards exist in an autonomous international legal order; no single court system has monopoly control |\n| **Albert Jan van den Berg**, *The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958* | Article V defenses are exhaustive and narrowly construed; public policy is an exceptional defense |\n| **Lew, Mistelis & Kröll**, *Comparative International Commercial Arbitration* | Tribunals are not bound by injunctions from courts outside the seat |\n| **George Bermann**, *Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards* (2017) | Comprehensive analysis of the pro-enforcement bias and the limits of public policy |\n| **William W. Park**, *Arbitration of International Business Disputes* (2nd ed.) | Competence-competence and the autonomy of the arbitral process |\n\n---\n\n## VII. Recommended Litigation Strategy\n\n1. **Lead with Paramedics (2d Cir.)** — argue that the injunction itself was improper and that the New York Convention enforcement stage is the correct checkpoint.\n\n2. **Emphasize the burden of proof** — the opponent must establish a ground for refusal; you need only show that no ground is met.\n\n3. **Frame the public policy argument narrowly** — invoke Parsons & Whittemore and its progeny to show that the bar is extraordinarily high.\n\n4. **Demonstrate procedural fairness** — show that the opponent received notice, had the opportunity to participate, and that the tribunal considered jurisdictional objections.\n\n5. **Invoke comity and the multilateral framework** — frame any refusal as a destabilizing unilateral act inconsistent with the US's treaty obligations.\n\n6. **Prepare for the \"set aside\" contingency** — if the opponent seeks annulment in France, monitor those proceedings and be prepared to argue under Chromalloy that US courts can enforce even a set-aside award (though this argument is more contested after Commisa/PEMEX).\n\n---\n\n## VIII. Conclusion\n\nThe enforcement position is **strong**. The New York Convention's architecture, US appellate precedent (particularly in the Second Circuit, which governs New York), the law of the arbitral seat (France), and the weight of scholarly opinion all support deference to the tribunal's decision to proceed and to the resulting award. The opponent's best argument — public policy based on the violated injunction — faces the formidable barrier of Parsons & Whittemore's \"most basic notions of morality and justice\" standard, and is further undermined by the fact that the injunction itself was likely improper under Paramedics.\n\nShall I draft specific sections of the enforcement brief, or develop any of these arguments in greater detail?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 124, "completion_tokens": 3917, "total_tokens": 4041}, "latency_s": 79.50850625001476, "request_id": "chatcmpl-da6fae7a-105a-4d22-be76-580a4d60bf8b", "raw_response": null}
