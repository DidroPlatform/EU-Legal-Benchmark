It does not address the specific hypothetical condition required by the criterion: what happens if the swerve itself was *not* negligent (i.e., what a reasonable, sober person would have done). Instead, it focuses on the drunk driver's liability and the truck driver's emergency response, failing to engage with the specific nuance of the criterion regarding the truck driver's potential liability if the swerve was deemed non-negligent.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ff67bf61-062a-4cca-acf8-5003202b85d7\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1127, "completion_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 1336}, "latency_s": 1.0891763750114478, "request_id": "4-CUaaXwAYDXvdIPm5KRmQE", "raw_response": null}
