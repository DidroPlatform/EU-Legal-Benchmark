The candidate answer focuses heavily on jurisdictional issues and the arbitration strategy (defending against the termination claim and gathering evidence of the German firm's motivation). While it mentions preparing a defense against the security vulnerability claim (which relates to the termination), it never explicitly states or implies that the US client (the non-breaching party, assuming the termination was wrongful) is entitled to damages for the early termination breach. It addresses the *defense* against the termination, not the *claim* for damages resulting from the termination.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b970530c-da92-497b-9fbe-00a531a61a8d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 816, "completion_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 1001}, "latency_s": 1.0080719999969006, "request_id": "chCVadKLBPbzxs0P0ID50Aw", "raw_response": null}
