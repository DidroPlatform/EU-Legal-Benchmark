The candidate answer focuses heavily on the initial scraping/training (Step 2, point 1) and the generation of a derivative work (Step 2, point 2), which is a direct adaptation of the character, rather than solely focusing on the similarity of the final ad output to the original character. Specifically, the analysis addresses the scraping/training as the primary infringement, and the generated image as an 'adaptation' (s. 20 CDPA), which is a broader claim than just output similarity. The analysis correctly frames the issue around the unauthorized copying/adaptation for training and the subsequent commercial use, not just the visual resemblance of the final ad image to the original character.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ad06eeb9-2ef4-4c8b-9a18-0704812d1a6a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4257, "completion_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 4478}, "latency_s": 0.96980016696034, "request_id": "He2UaZ6vIcPwnsEPpffzuQM", "raw_response": null}
