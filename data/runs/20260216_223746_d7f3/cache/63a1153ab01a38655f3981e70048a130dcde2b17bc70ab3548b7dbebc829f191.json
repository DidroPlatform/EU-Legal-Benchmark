The candidate answer states the standard position is that a constructive trust claim ranks *behind* secured creditors and that the lender's charge typically has priority. It discusses potential exceptions based on fraud or misrepresentation to the lender, but it does not explicitly state the legal principle that a registered charge *cannot* overreach the beneficiary's interest in the manner described by the criterion. In fact, it leans toward the lender having priority unless specific exceptions apply.\", \"criterion_id\": \"56903d4e-63dc-4bc3-85b3-6931cd0ed7b8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1691, "completion_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 1863}, "latency_s": 0.7977644169586711, "request_id": "x9qUadmULKzyxN8PwryZ8Q4", "raw_response": null}
