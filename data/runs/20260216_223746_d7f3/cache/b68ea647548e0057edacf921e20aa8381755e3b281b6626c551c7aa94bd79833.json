The candidate answer explicitly discusses the UK context (HMRC, Queen's Counsel, administration) and analyzes the civil liability in terms of 'reckless indifference' and 'jury sympathy' (which is a US concept, but the core analysis focuses on the *consequences* of the admission in civil court, not on applying a specific US damages cap ratio). Crucially, the response does not mention or apply any specific U.S.-style punitive damages ratio limit (like a single-digit multiplier). It correctly frames the UK issue as avoiding bankruptcy from tax penalties versus facing massive civil judgments, which aligns with the UK legal environment where punitive damages are rare, and compensation aims to restore the claimant's position, though civil liability can still be massive based on negligence/recklessness. Since the response does not *incorrectly apply* a US ratio limit, the criterion is satisfied by its absence/non-application.\", \"criterion_id\": \"42abff97-5213-4dd4-af7d-f21aac1cdd89\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2757, "completion_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 3015}, "latency_s": 1.1290085410000756, "request_id": "B_2UacW-Eo65kdUPzNPImQM", "raw_response": null}
