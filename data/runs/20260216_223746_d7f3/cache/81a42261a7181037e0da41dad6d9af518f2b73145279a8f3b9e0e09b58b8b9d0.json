While 5% is mentioned as a possible outcome, the criterion demands that the response *states* that the treaty *enables* the reduction *to* 5%, implying this is the specific rate achieved or explicitly stated by the treaty for dividends. Since the answer presents 5% as one of two possibilities (0% being the other), it does not strictly confirm the specific statement required by the criterion as the definitive outcome.\", \"criterion_id\": \"326e90ac-5058-455d-bb77-835d76b70cff\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4287, "completion_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 4508}, "latency_s": 0.9563137500081211, "request_id": "j_CUaY7uNrW5kdUPzM_0sAM", "raw_response": null}
