The candidate answer explicitly addresses this under Section 1.1 (Article 5(3) FSO) and Section 2.2, noting the mutual obligation to cooperate. In the conclusion (Section 4), the answer states that the neighbouring company bears the most direct responsibility, but that the owner (the candidate's company) carries 'significant secondary liability' due to the deficient risk assessment and retained duties as building owner. This analysis clearly supports the concept that liability is shared/apportioned between the owner and tenant due to shared control and failures in cooperation/oversight, satisfying the requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e230acad-079d-4755-a895-6b8e56fa4390\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4423, "completion_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 4631}, "latency_s": 0.868041291978443, "request_id": "Gr-UaeKDK-XonsEPxa3MyQI", "raw_response": null}
