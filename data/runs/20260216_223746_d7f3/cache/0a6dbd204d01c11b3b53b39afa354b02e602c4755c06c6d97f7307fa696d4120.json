The following is general guidance based on publicly available interpretations of UK legislation as of my last knowledge update. Fire and safety incidents involving fatalities trigger serious investigations by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Fire and Rescue Authorities (e.g., London Fire Brigade), and potentially the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for breaches that could lead to charges (e.g., under s.2/3 HSWA for employer duties or Article 32 FSO for fire safety offences). You should immediately consult a specialist solicitor experienced in health & safety law, and cooperate fully with investigators. Retain all records and consider instructing experts (e.g., fire engineers) for your defense.\n\n### Relevant Legislation\nKey laws apply to your scenario (factory/outbuilding in England):\n- **Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (FSO)**: Applies to non-domestic premises. The \"responsible person\" (RP) must carry out a suitable & sufficient fire risk assessment (FRA, Art.9), implement general fire precautions (Art.8-22), ensure equipment maintenance (Art.17), and cooperate with other occupiers (Art.23). RP is typically the employer/owner/occupier with control over premises (Art.3). Breaches are criminal offences (Art.32), with unlimited fines or up to 2 years' imprisonment.\n- **Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HSWA)**: s.2 (safe plant/systems for employees), s.3 (safety of non-employees), s.4 (landlord duties for common parts). \"So far as is reasonably practicable\" (SFAIRP) test applies – balancing cost/risk/effort.\n- **Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (EAWR)**: Reg.4 requires electrical systems/equipment to be constructed, maintained, and used to prevent danger (includes portable appliance testing – PAT – for items >50V AC). Duty on those \"at work\" on/installing equipment.\n- **Management of Health & Safety at Work Regulations 1999**: Requires risk assessments covering all hazards (Reg.3).\n- **Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002 (DSEAR)**: If flammable products stored, requires assessment of ignition sources (e.g., electrical faults).\n- **Lease terms**: Your lease to the neighbor likely allocates duties (e.g., they maintain their equipment; you maintain structure).\n\nIn **shared premises**, RPs must coordinate (FSO Art.23). As owner, you're likely RP for the building fabric/common areas; the lessee for their area/equipment. HSE/CPS consider \"control\" and foreseeability.\n\n### What You Need to Demonstrate: Sufficient \"Reasonable Steps\" for Fire Safety\nTo defend that you took \"all reasonable steps\" (SFAIRP under HSWA/FSO), show a **systematic, documented approach** to risk management. Investigators assess proportionality (e.g., via HSE's F5000 guide or FSO Approved Code of Practice). Provide evidence chronologically, ideally via a compliance portfolio.\n\n#### Key Evidence to Demonstrate (with Advantages/Disadvantages)\n| **Requirement** | **What to Show** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages/Risks** |\n|-----------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| **Identify RP & Scope** (FSO Art.5/9; HSWA s.2) | Named RP(s) in writing (you as owner; lessee for their space). Lease clauses requiring lessee's compliance (e.g., PAT testing). Joint FRA or liaison records. | Clear lease ownership strengthens your position as not controlling lessee's equipment. Third-party FRA shows proactive delegation. | Shared use blurs control – if no joint protocol, you may be seen as having overarching duty (FSO multi-occupied guidance). Omission of shared risks in FRA weakens. |\n| **Suitable & Sufficient FRA** (FSO Art.9; MHSWR Reg.3) | Full FRA report, review dates, actions implemented. Covers electrical hazards generically (even if PAT not specified). | Independent third-party FRA is strong evidence of diligence (courts value experts, e.g., *R v Tangerine Confectionery* [2011]). No PAT mention = not your gap if focused on \"fire\" (not electrical). | FRA omission of PAT/electrical shorts (common fire cause, per LFB stats) could be criticized as insufficient (FSO requires \"all significant risks\"). No review post-lease changes? Vulnerability. |\n| **Prevent/Control Hazards** (FSO Art.11-14; EAWR Reg.4; HSWA s.2) | Electrical maintenance records (your equipment PAT'd?). Access controls/logs for lessee's items. No-smoking/hot works permits. Fire detection/suppression in outbuilding. | Ownership + FRA compliance shows you addressed structural risks. Fire from lessee's item shifts focus. | Lessee's unPAT'd equipment introduced hazard – but did you inspect/enforce lease terms? No \"right of access\" clause? Seen as negligent oversight (HSWA s.4). |\n| **Maintenance & Safety Measures** (FSO Art.17; HSWA s.2) | Fixed wiring inspection (EICR), emergency lighting, signage, drills, training records. Evacuation plans shared with lessee. | Paid third-party = credible. If implemented fully, demonstrates SFAIRP. | Outbuilding shared/remote – if not routinely inspected, \"glaring omission\" (HSE prosecution criteria). Products stored = DSEAR gap if not assessed. |\n| **Emergency Procedures** (FSO Art.10-15) | PEEPs, fire marshal training, liaison with LFB. Post-fire cooperation. | Loss of life scrutiny high, but good plans mitigate charges. | One fatality = potential gross breach if escape impeded (e.g., locked doors?). |\n| **Monitoring & Review** (FSO Art.9(7)) | Audit trails, incident logs, lessee compliance checks. Insurance fire policy. | Ongoing records show culture of safety. | No PAT enforcement pre-incident = failure to monitor shared risks. |\n| **Cooperation with Others** (FSO Art.23) | Lease requiring lessee FRA/PAT; joint meetings/emails. | Lease as contract helps indemnity claim against lessee. | If no enforcement, you're vicariously liable (HSWA s.3 for \"others\"). |\n\n**Overall Advantages**:\n- Ownership + third-party FRA = defensible starting point (HSE often lenient if proportionate).\n- Cause traced to lessee's equipment = redirects blame (forensic evidence key).\n- No prior incidents = good compliance history.\n\n**Overall Disadvantages**:\n- FRA gaps (PAT/electrics) + shared space = potential \"failure to identify obvious risk\" (*R v Balfour Beatty* [2006]).\n- Fatality elevates to manslaughter risk if \"gross breach\" (Corporate Manslaughter Act 2007).\n- CPS/HSE use \"reasonable foreseeability\" test – electrical faults = 25% of fires (LFB data); shared lease foreseeable.\n\n**Actions Now**: Collate all docs digitally. Commission independent post-fire review. Witness statements. Forensic electrical report blaming lessee's gear.\n\n### Primary Blame for Incident & Loss of Life\n**Primarily: The neighboring company (lessee)**.\n- They introduced/brought in the unPAT'd equipment (direct cause per your facts).\n- EAWR/HSWA breach: Duty to ensure safe (SFAIRP). PAT is standard for portable gear (HSE INDG236).\n- FSO Art.13: They control their equipment/area.\n- Criminal liability likely on them (s.37 HSWA if directors culpable).\n\n**Your Shared/Secondary Liability**:\n- As owner/RP for premises (FSO/HSWA s.4), duty to ensure common safety (e.g., inspect shared space).\n- If lease didn't enforce PAT/FRA from lessee, or no audits, partial blame (e.g., contributory negligence in civil claims).\n- Investigators apportion via \"but for\" test + SFAIRP. Lessee ~70-90% likely (if evidence clear); you lower if FRA solid.\n\n**Outcomes**:\n- HSE Improvement/Financial Notices possible.\n- CPS prosecutes if \"material breach contributed\" to death (Sentencing Council guidelines: fatalities = custodial risks).\n- Civil: Inquests, claims from deceased's family (fatal accident compensation).\n\nUrgently notify insurers; seek legal aid via HSE specialist (e.g., Hudgell Solicitors or Leigh Day).
