The analysis of procedural risks is too generic and jurisdiction-specific rather than focused on the *cross-border* procedural interaction.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b334b6cf-6a8a-4036-91d3-5dc65bb28b02\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1516, "completion_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 1714}, "latency_s": 1.3949742920231074, "request_id": "MgeVadLrDP367M8P1uGygAU", "raw_response": null}
