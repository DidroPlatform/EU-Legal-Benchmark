The candidate answer discusses the Windsor Framework's operationalisation (Green/Red lanes) and correctly notes that the trader bears the practical burden of demonstrating eligibility for Green Lane treatment (i.e., proving they are *not* at risk). However, it does not explicitly state that the *original* Protocol (as enacted) contained a presumption that *all* goods were 'at risk' unless proven otherwise, which is the specific historical context the criterion targets (referencing the initial implementation under JC Decision 4/2020). The answer focuses more on the *current* operational reality under Windsor, where the burden is on the trader to qualify for the *exception* (Green Lane), rather than explicitly confirming the initial 'all goods are at risk' presumption.\", \"criterion_id\": \"61afe06c-4c7c-460c-8a2e-3ba3157cf84e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4105, "completion_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 4354}, "latency_s": 0.914290709013585, "request_id": "hCCVad7QM_Dm7M8PqbvO6QU", "raw_response": null}
