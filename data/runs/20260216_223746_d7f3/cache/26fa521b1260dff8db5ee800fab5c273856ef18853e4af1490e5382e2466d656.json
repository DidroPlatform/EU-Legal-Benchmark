Introduction\n\nThe quoted statement, attributable to Milton Friedman (*New York Times Magazine*, 13 September 1970), posits that the sole social responsibility of a corporation is profit maximisation for its shareholders. While this thesis reflects a classical shareholder-primacy model, it must be critically examined in light of the evolving Swiss legal framework, corporate governance principles, and the broader stakeholder-oriented conception of the firm that pervades Swiss corporate law.\n\n---\n\n## II. The Shareholder-Primacy Model and Its Legal Foundations\n\n### 1. Partial Support in Swiss Corporate Law\n\nSwiss corporate law does, to a degree, reflect the primacy of shareholder interests. The *Obligationenrecht* (OR) structures the *Aktiengesellschaft* (AG) around the shareholders' economic interests:\n\n- **Art. 620 ff. OR** establish the AG as a vehicle for capital investment and profit generation.\n- **Art. 660 Abs. 1 OR** grants shareholders the right to a proportionate share of profits (*Dividendenrecht*).\n- **Art. 717 Abs. 1 OR** obliges the board of directors (*Verwaltungsrat*) to act in the **interest of the company** (*Gesellschaftsinteresse*), which traditionally has been understood to include the long-term profitability of the enterprise.\n- The fiduciary duties of the board (Art. 717 OR) and the duty of care and loyalty (*Treue- und Sorgfaltspflicht*) are owed primarily in the context of safeguarding the company's economic viability.\n\n### 2. Friedman's Thesis as an Incomplete Description\n\nEven under a narrow reading, Art. 717 Abs. 1 OR does **not** reduce the board's duty to mere short-term profit maximisation. The prevailing doctrine (*herrschende Lehre*) interprets the *Gesellschaftsinteresse* as encompassing the **long-term, sustainable** interest of the company, which necessarily includes considerations beyond immediate shareholder returns.\n\n---\n\n## III. Disagreement: The Stakeholder Dimension in Swiss Law\n\n### 1. Explicit Stakeholder Obligations\n\nSwiss law has progressively moved beyond pure shareholder primacy:\n\n- **Art. 717 Abs. 1 OR** – The duty to act in the interest of the company is understood by the *Bundesgericht* and leading doctrine (BÖCKLI, FORSTMOSER/MEIER-HAYOZ/NOBEL) as encompassing the interests of **multiple stakeholders**, including employees, creditors, and the public interest, particularly where the long-term viability of the enterprise is at stake.\n\n- **Art. 964a ff. OR** (in force since 1 January 2024) – The new provisions on **non-financial reporting** (*Berichterstattung über nichtfinanzielle Belange*) require large public-interest companies to report on environmental matters, social issues, employee-related matters, respect for human rights, and anti-corruption measures. This legislative choice directly contradicts Friedman's thesis by imposing legally binding obligations that extend well beyond profit maximisation.\n\n- **Art. 964j ff. OR** – The **due diligence and reporting obligations regarding minerals and metals from conflict areas and child labour** (*Sorgfaltspflichten und Transparenz bezüglich Mineralien und Metallen aus Konfliktgebieten und Kinderarbeit*) impose substantive duties on companies that are entirely unrelated to profit maximisation and reflect a legislative commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR).\n\n### 2. The Indirect Counter-Proposal to the Responsible Business Initiative\n\nThe provisions of Art. 964a ff. OR emerged as the **indirect counter-proposal** (*indirekter Gegenvorschlag*) to the *Konzernverantwortungsinitiative* (Responsible Business Initiative), which was rejected by the *Ständemehr* on 29 November 2020 despite achieving a popular majority. The political and legislative process demonstrates a strong societal expectation that businesses bear responsibilities beyond profit.\n\n### 3. Employee Protection and Co-Determination\n\n- **Art. 328 OR** imposes duties of care (*Fürsorgepflicht*) on employers toward employees.\n- **Mitwirkungsgesetz (MitwG)** grants employees information and consultation rights, reflecting a stakeholder model.\n\n### 4. Environmental and Public Law Obligations\n\n- The **Umweltschutzgesetz (USG)** and related regulations impose environmental duties on businesses irrespective of their profitability implications.\n- **Art. 52 BV** (sustainability principle) and **Art. 94 Abs. 2 BV** (economic policy serving the common good) provide constitutional anchoring for a broader conception of corporate responsibility.\n\n### 5. Corporate Governance Standards\n\nThe **Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance** (economiesuisse, 2023 revision) explicitly recognises that the board must consider the interests of stakeholders and sustainability factors. While soft law, it shapes the interpretation of directors' duties under Art. 717 OR.\n\n---\n\n## IV. The Limits of Friedman's Thesis in Light of Modern Developments\n\n### 1. ESG and Sustainable Finance\n\nThe growing body of regulation around **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** criteria — including FINMA guidance, the Swiss Climate and Innovation Act (*KlG*, in force since 1 January 2025), and alignment with EU regulatory developments — demonstrates that the legal order increasingly demands that businesses internalise externalities rather than externalise them in pursuit of profit.\n\n### 2. Liability Considerations\n\nA board that pursues profit maximisation to the exclusion of all other considerations risks:\n\n- **Personal liability under Art. 754 OR** if the neglect of stakeholder interests or regulatory compliance leads to damage to the company.\n- **Criminal liability** under various provisions (e.g., Art. 102 StGB on corporate criminal liability).\n\n---\n\n## V. Conclusion\n\n**I disagree** with Friedman's thesis as a normative proposition and as a description of Swiss positive law.\n\nWhile profit generation remains a central purpose of the *Aktiengesellschaft*, Swiss law — through the *Obligationenrecht*, constitutional principles, and an expanding body of regulatory obligations — clearly imposes **multiple social responsibilities** on businesses that transcend profit maximisation. The board's duty under **Art. 717 Abs. 1 OR** is owed to the **company as a whole**, not merely to shareholders' short-term financial interests. The introduction of **Art. 964a ff. OR** and **Art. 964j ff. OR** represents a decisive legislative rejection of the Friedman doctrine in the Swiss legal order.\n\nThe modern Swiss conception of corporate responsibility is best described as an **enlightened stakeholder model**: the company must generate sustainable value while respecting its obligations toward employees, the environment, human rights, and the broader public interest. Profit is a necessary condition for the company's existence, but it is not its sole *raison d'être* in the eyes of the law.\n\n---\n\n*Note: This analysis assumes a course covering Swiss corporate law (OR), corporate governance, CSR/ESG, and the Responsible Business Initiative debate.
