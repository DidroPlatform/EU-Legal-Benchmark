The candidate answer states that for the 'Warped version mocking the show's joke,' the defense is the 'Strongest parody defense' and that it is 'Likely protected if transformative and doesn't substitute for original merchandise.' This directly contradicts the required assertion that it would be considered a copyright violation (infringement). While the candidate acknowledges the possibility of infringement, it heavily favors the parody defense, suggesting it is likely protected, rather than stating it *would be considered* a violation as a derivative work.\", \"criterion_id\": \"7fa2efd8-305b-4b3e-b8d7-eddaaba059cd\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1743, "completion_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 1937}, "latency_s": 7.074289042007877, "request_id": "ydSUaenKHeXonsEPxa3MyQI", "raw_response": null}
