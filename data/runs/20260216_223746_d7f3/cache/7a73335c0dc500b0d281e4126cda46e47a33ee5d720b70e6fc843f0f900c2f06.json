While the response does not explicitly use the term 'without prejudice' (which typically relates to settlement negotiations), it strongly advocates for securing a 'no-admission-of-knowledge clause' within the DPA and implementing a 'protective order/confidentiality undertaking' to prevent statements made to HMRC from being used in civil proceedings. This directly addresses the core concern of the criterion: managing admissions of fact made to an authority (HMRC) to protect the client in subsequent litigation (civil suits). Specifically, Section 3.1 includes the clause: 'The Company does not admit any knowledge or participation in the alleged tax evasion. The cooperation is provided solely to assist HMRC in its investigation of third-party fraud,' which is the functional equivalent of controlling admissions of fact in this context.\", \"criterion_id\": \"94086a98-120c-465b-b687-a4fa8f63e165\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4484, "completion_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 4712}, "latency_s": 1.240486124996096, "request_id": "le2Uac-3MMD97M8P2J3Q4Qk", "raw_response": null}
