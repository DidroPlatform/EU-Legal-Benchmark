The candidate answer discusses foreseeability extensively, referencing *R v Roberts* and *R v Marjoram*, and concludes that swerving to avoid an obstacle is a foreseeable reaction. However, it never explicitly links the *foreseeability of the reaction* to the *conspicuousness/visibility* of the chair itself, which is the specific element required by the criterion. The analysis focuses on the *type* of reaction (swerving) rather than the *ability to perceive* the hazard that triggered the reaction.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d2abf342-9ee3-4014-82e6-c59502d6c44a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2721, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 2931}, "latency_s": 1.1131672089977656, "request_id": "yMKUac_5Iv27nsEPhr2MyQM", "raw_response": null}
