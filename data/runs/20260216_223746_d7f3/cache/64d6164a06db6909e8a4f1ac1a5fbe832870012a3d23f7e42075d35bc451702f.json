The candidate answer addresses this in Section 3, stating: 'If you were in occupation and never consented, that is often the factual hook to challenge priority...' and later asks questions like 'Were you living there at the time of the remortgage/further advance?' and 'Were you temporarily absent (work, hospital, staying elsewhere) when the lender inspected? (Temporary absence doesn\\u2019t necessarily defeat \\u201cactual occupation,\\u201d but it becomes fact-sensitive.)' While it doesn't explicitly define 'clear signs of habitation' using the exact phrasing, it correctly frames 'actual occupation' as the key factual inquiry regarding physical presence and investigation by the lender, which satisfies the intent of the criterion regarding the relevance of occupation to the lender's position.\", \"criterion_id\": \"52652878-e3f0-4e46-ac6b-dde189cd58b5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2485, "completion_tokens": 260, "total_tokens": 2745}, "latency_s": 7.435479625011794, "request_id": "ABmVadaCDMPgvdIP96mU8Qw", "raw_response": null}
