The response explicitly mentions the NY Convention in the context of award enforcement: 'Post-award, English award enforceable in Germany (despite delays; see *Dallah* [2010] UKSC 46). / **NY Convention Enforcement** / Award blocks German judgment.' Since the US is the client's location, the UK is the seat of arbitration, and Germany is the location of the counterparty/potential litigation, these three nations are implicitly or explicitly central to the analysis, and the enforcement discussion confirms the relevance of the NY Convention among these jurisdictions. The analysis relies on the enforceability of the award in Germany, which is governed by the NY Convention, and the US is the home country of the client, making it a key jurisdiction for asset recovery if needed. The UK (as the seat) is also a signatory. Therefore, the necessary parties are covered.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ad00e870-6504-4fd3-81e6-1665581ca1eb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2053, "completion_tokens": 250, "total_tokens": 2303}, "latency_s": 13.152645084017422, "request_id": "rDGVadfSN7W5kdUP1c_0sAM", "raw_response": null}
