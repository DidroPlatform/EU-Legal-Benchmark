The candidate answer discusses Section 245A extensively, noting that it provides a 100 percent dividends-received deduction for dividends received from a 'specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation' and mentions that the repatriation is tax-free 'under Section 245A.' However, it fails to explicitly list the specific eligibility requirements mentioned in the criterion (10% ownership, one-year holding period, non-hybrid dividends). While the 10% ownership is implied by '10-percent owned foreign corporation,' the other two explicit requirements are missing from the text.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2a0ba6d9-a2bf-46db-9bba-c8a3b1f24f06\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4362, "completion_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 4580}, "latency_s": 1.165420915989671, "request_id": "P8WUaZ-9Bpn7nsEP24btcA", "raw_response": null}
