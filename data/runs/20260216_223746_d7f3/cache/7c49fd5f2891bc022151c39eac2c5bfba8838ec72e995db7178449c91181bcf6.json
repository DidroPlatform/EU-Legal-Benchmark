P&L Audit Ltd*\n**Issue:** Whether P&L Audit Ltd may invoke the *ex turpi causa* defense (illegality defense) to defeat a claim for breach of the duty of care in auditing financial statements under Swiss law.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Preliminary Observations**\nThe facts suggest a potential claim by the liquidator of *Digital Assets Ltd (in liquidation)* against *P&L Audit Ltd* for negligent auditing (breach of the duty of care under **Art. 755 CO** or **Art. 55 CO**). The key question is whether *P&L Audit Ltd* may raise the *ex turpi causa* defense, arguing that the company’s own unlawful conduct (Achille Taloon’s willful misrepresentation) precludes liability.\n\n**Missing Factual Clarifications (if any):**\n- Whether *P&L Audit Ltd* was aware of or complicit in Achille Taloon’s fraud.\n- Whether the liquidator’s claim is based on **contractual liability (Art. 398 CO)** or **tortious liability (Art. 41 CO)**.\n- Whether the audited financial statements were used for unlawful purposes (e.g., tax evasion, securities fraud).\n\nAssuming the claim is based on **negligent auditing (Art. 755 CO or Art. 55 CO)**, the analysis proceeds as follows.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Applicability of the *Ex Turpi Causa* Defense under Swiss Law**\nSwiss law recognizes the *ex turpi causa* principle (derived from **Art. 20 CO**, which voids contracts violating public policy or mandatory law). However, its application in tort or professional liability cases is **restricted** and subject to the following conditions:\n\n#### **a) Unlawful or Immoral Conduct by the Claimant**\nThe defense requires that:\n1. The claimant (*Digital Assets Ltd*) engaged in **unlawful or immoral conduct** (e.g., fraud, tax evasion, market manipulation).\n2. The unlawful conduct was **directly linked** to the harm suffered (e.g., the fraudulent financial statements were the basis for the company’s insolvency).\n\n**Application to the Facts:**\n- Achille Taloon’s **willful overestimation of company value** likely constitutes **fraud (Art. 146 SCC)** or **false representation in commercial dealings (Art. 152 SCC)**.\n- The company (through its sole director) **actively participated in the unlawful scheme**, which may impute liability to the company itself under **Art. 55 CO** (vicarious liability for organs).\n\n#### **b) Proportionality and Causal Link**\nThe defense is **not absolute** and must be balanced against:\n- The **severity of the unlawful conduct** (here, fraud is a serious offense).\n- The **causal contribution of the defendant’s negligence** (P&L Audit Ltd’s failure to detect the fraud).\n- Whether the claimant’s unlawful conduct was the **predominant cause** of the harm.\n\n**Swiss Case Law (BGE 133 III 449, 454 ff.):**\nThe Federal Supreme Court has held that *ex turpi causa* may bar claims where:\n- The claimant’s unlawful conduct was **intentional** (as opposed to negligent).\n- The defendant’s liability arises **solely from the claimant’s unlawful act** (e.g., a bank suing for unpaid loans used for money laundering).\n\nHowever, **mere negligence by the defendant (e.g., auditing failures) does not automatically trigger the defense** if the claimant’s unlawful conduct was not the **exclusive cause** of the harm.\n\n#### **c) Application to Auditors’ Liability**\nUnder **Art. 755 CO**, auditors owe a **duty of care** to the company and its stakeholders. If P&L Audit Ltd **negligently failed to detect fraud**, it may be liable for damages, **unless**:\n1. The company’s fraud was **so pervasive** that no reasonable audit could have uncovered it (unlikely here, given the willful nature of the misrepresentation).\n2. The company’s unlawful conduct **directly caused the harm**, and P&L Audit Ltd’s negligence was **not a substantial contributing factor**.\n\n**Key Distinction:**\n- If P&L Audit Ltd was **merely negligent**, the defense may **fail** because the company’s fraud does not **fully absolve** the auditor of liability.\n- If P&L Audit Ltd was **complicit** (e.g., knowingly signed off on fraudulent statements), the defense may **succeed** under **Art. 44 CO** (contributory fault).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Likely Outcome**\nGiven the facts:\n1. **Achille Taloon’s fraud** is a **serious unlawful act** imputable to the company.\n2. **P&L Audit Ltd’s negligence** (if proven) contributed to the harm by failing to detect the fraud.\n3. The **liquidator’s claim** is not based on the company’s own unlawful conduct but on the auditor’s breach of duty.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe *ex turpi causa* defense is **unlikely to succeed** in full because:\n- The company’s fraud does not **exclusively** cause the harm (the auditor’s negligence is a **concurrent cause**).\n- Swiss courts apply the defense **restrictively** in professional liability cases (BGE 133 III 449).\n- The liquidator’s claim is **derivative** (on behalf of creditors/shareholders), not directly based on the company’s unlawful conduct.\n\nHowever, if P&L Audit Ltd can prove that:\n- The fraud was **undetectable** despite reasonable care, or\n- The company’s unlawful conduct was the **sole cause** of the insolvency,\nthen the defense **may partially reduce liability** under **Art. 44 CO** (contributory negligence).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Final Answer**\nUnder Swiss law, *P&L Audit Ltd* may **not successfully invoke the *ex turpi causa* defense** to **fully defeat** the liquidator’s claim for breach of the duty of care in auditing. While the company’s fraudulent conduct (imputable to *Digital Assets Ltd* via its sole director) constitutes unlawful behavior, the defense does not **automatically bar** liability where the auditor’s negligence was a **substantial contributing factor** to the harm.\n\nThe defense may, however, **reduce liability** under **Art. 44 CO** if the court finds that the company’s unlawful conduct **predominantly caused** the insolvency. The outcome depends on:\n1. The **degree of P&L Audit Ltd’s negligence** (whether it met the standard of care under **Art. 755 CO**).\n2. The **causal link** between the fraud and the harm (whether the auditor’s failure was a **necessary condition** for the loss).\n\n**Recommendation:**\nThe liquidator’s claim should proceed, but P&L Audit Ltd may argue **contributory fault (Art. 44 CO)** to limit damages. A full defense under *ex turpi causa* is **unlikely to succeed** absent proof that the auditor’s negligence was **not a substantial cause** of the insolvency.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 405, "completion_tokens": 1622, "total_tokens": 2027}, "latency_s": 28.347518707974814, "request_id": "82f23041d87742bfb5c4a6f132731b01", "raw_response": null}
