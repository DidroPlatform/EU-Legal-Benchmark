The candidate answer focuses entirely on defending the *enforcement* of an award already rendered, arguing for narrow review under Article V and deference to the tribunal's jurisdiction finding. It does not address the circumstances under which a New York court would *enjoin* the arbitration proceeding itself (which is what the criterion asks about, based on the context of the user's hypothetical scenario where the tribunal proceeded *despite* an injunction). While the context implies the injunction might have been sought in New York, the answer fails to state the specific, limited grounds under which NY courts would grant such an injunction.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f24c358a-43a3-47ef-b32c-ce86625942a9\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3171, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 3381}, "latency_s": 0.9274779999977909, "request_id": "HBqVadf-NPfnnsEPornoiAk", "raw_response": null}
