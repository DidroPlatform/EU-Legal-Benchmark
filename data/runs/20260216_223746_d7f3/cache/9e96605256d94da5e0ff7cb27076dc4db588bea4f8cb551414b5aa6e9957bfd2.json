The answer effectively uses Swiss corporate law (OR articles, BGE cases) to structure the argument, contrasting the primary profit orientation (shareholder primacy) with mandatory broader social responsibilities (compliance, creditor protection, sustainability due diligence). This structure mirrors the expected structure outlined in the reference answer (shareholder wealth maximization argument vs. broader social responsibilities/stakeholder model). The depth of legal citation and analysis is strong, covering key aspects like the purpose of the corporation, board duties, and modern ESG obligations, which align well with the reference points (e.g., discussing broader social role, purpose of corporate law). The only minor deduction is the necessary qualification due to the missing course context, which the candidate explicitly notes.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.85}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1869, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 2079}, "latency_s": 0.9486205829889514, "request_id": "ODaVadf3BtqfnsEPvPyNyAM", "raw_response": null}
