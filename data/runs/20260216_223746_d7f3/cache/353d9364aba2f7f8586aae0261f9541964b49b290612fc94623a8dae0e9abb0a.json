First, it contrasts financing via direct equity contribution from the U.S. parent versus intercompany debt, noting the implications of Section 385 recharacterization (a structural choice). Second, it contrasts financing directly from the U.S. parent versus routing the financing through an Irish sister subsidiary, which introduces Subpart F and GILTI considerations (a modular entity design choice). The discussion of the Section 385 recharacterization rules and the comparison between direct U.S. funding versus funding via a sister CFC (Ireland) clearly demonstrates consideration of at least two distinct structural flexibility options.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5338ade1-d4a6-44bc-b8f6-9728ea8a5fc1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4349, "completion_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 4535}, "latency_s": 1.0490724999981467, "request_id": "Z8WUafWiBPCMkdUPn6WNwAE", "raw_response": null}
