The candidate answer discusses copyright infringement, unfair competition, and exceptions like parody/political expression in Italy, but it never explicitly names the 'right to integrity' (diritto morale d'autore) as the most common moral right or links the association with a cause directly to that specific right as the core violation theory. It mentions the political expression shirt, but frames it under parody/exception analysis, not the specific moral right mentioned in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"72f92aac-0d46-4c0e-a5ca-990c3e6c5a46\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2477, "completion_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 2661}, "latency_s": 0.9419031660072505, "request_id": "kiGVaZD-NY65kdUPytPImQM", "raw_response": null}
