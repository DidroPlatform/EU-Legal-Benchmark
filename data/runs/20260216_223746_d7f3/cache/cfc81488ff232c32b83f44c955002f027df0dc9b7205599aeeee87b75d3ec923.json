The candidate answer correctly identifies that GDPR applies and discusses transparency and lawful basis. However, the core of the criterion is about *sensitive* data. The candidate answer explicitly states: 'The data isn't sensitive (unless health conditions were detailed)'. Since the prompt only mentions collecting data on the *ability* to practice sports, which is generally not considered sensitive data under Article 9 of GDPR unless it reveals underlying health conditions, the candidate answer does not directly address or confirm the prohibition on processing sensitive data as the primary focus. It focuses on general data processing requirements (transparency, lawful basis). Therefore, it does not clearly satisfy the specific criterion regarding the prohibition of sensitive data processing.\", \"criterion_id\": \"fd754e9b-be6c-4bd3-859a-226cfebf6a88\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 684, "completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 886}, "latency_s": 4.295092459011357, "request_id": "u9aUabPiDofWvdIP3aGO4Ao", "raw_response": null}
