The candidate answer mentions Section 163(j) and the BEAT regime, stating that the U.S. parent must ensure compliance with BEAT if interest payments are made to a related foreign party, which could disallow deductions for certain outbound payments. However, it does not explicitly state the specific rule required by the criterion: that interest disallowed under \\u00a7163(j) is excluded from the definition of a base-erosion payment if properly tracked. This specific nuance of the interaction between \\u00a7163(j) and BEAT is missing.\", \"criterion_id\": \"64d8e07f-7f8b-4d17-8a65-783d5933347d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1521, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 1735}, "latency_s": 0.9017970419954509, "request_id": "8QGVabHxEPT77M8Prpvt6Ag", "raw_response": null}
