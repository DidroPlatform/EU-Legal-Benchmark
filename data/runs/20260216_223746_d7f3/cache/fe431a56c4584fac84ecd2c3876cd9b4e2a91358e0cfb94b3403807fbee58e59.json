The candidate answer states: 'Third-country goods (e.g., from China): If entering NI directly (e.g., via Belfast port), they are presumed \\\"at risk\\\" (since they could enter the EU via Ireland). Exception: If the importer can prove the goods are only for NI consumption, they may qualify for Green Lane treatment.' Furthermore, under the section 'NI\\u2192EU trade,' it states: 'NI goods can enter the EU tariff-free if they meet EU standards (e.g., SPS, CE marking).' While the answer correctly identifies that third-country goods are presumed 'at risk' unless proven otherwise for NI consumption, it also correctly implies that for those goods to enter the EU market *from* NI, they must meet EU standards (which includes product safety standards). The core requirement of the criterion is met by addressing the status of third-country goods entering NI and the necessity of meeting EU standards for onward movement, which is a fundamental aspect of the dual market access.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e4a1ae1b-a58e-4d31-bec4-4cf261c4a1c4\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2968, "completion_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 3259}, "latency_s": 0.9799123340053484, "request_id": "lwGVaYifGeTQnsEPhvGb-Ag", "raw_response": null}
