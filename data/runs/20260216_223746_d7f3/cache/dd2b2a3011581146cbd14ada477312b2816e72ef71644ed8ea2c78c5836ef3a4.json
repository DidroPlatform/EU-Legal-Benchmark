The candidate response lists the steps and documents required for the Italian work authorization process (Nulla Osta, D Visa, Permesso di Soggiorno) and mentions the need for a 'codice fiscale' (fiscal code) post-arrival, but it does not explicitly list the four required items ('fiscal code, work visa, contract of stay, residence permit') as a distinct list matching the criterion's expectation. It mentions 'D Visa (Entry)', 'Permesso di Soggiorno', and 'codice fiscale' but misses 'contract of stay' (which is often covered by the Nulla Osta/Visa/Permesso process but not listed as a distinct item matching the rubric). Therefore, the exact list required by the criterion is not present.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4ef8a6cb-61e1-4645-9e39-e3b41c1890eb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2418, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 2652}, "latency_s": 0.9339737499831244, "request_id": "1CaVadClNeyOkdUP_ZOcgQk", "raw_response": null}
