The response discusses parody under Italian law, stating that parody must be 'transformative, non-confusing, and non-commercial in effect.' Under US law, it mentions that warped mockery 'might claim parody (transformative commentary).' While this touches upon the concept of transformative use inherent in parody/satire, it does not explicitly define satire as using the original work as a vehicle to comment on a *different issue*, which is the specific requirement of the criterion. The discussion focuses on the legal tests (transformative, commercial effect) rather than the conceptual definition requested.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a9c831d9-dab7-42a9-b899-db182e763205\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1642, "completion_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 1831}, "latency_s": 0.8853981659631245, "request_id": "NjWVaYWrMeKAkdUPiI2EmQs", "raw_response": null}
