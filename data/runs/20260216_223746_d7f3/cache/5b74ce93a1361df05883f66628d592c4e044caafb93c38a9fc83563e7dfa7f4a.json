The candidate answer discusses the applicable law hurdle (Section 3) and notes that tribunals must have the authority to apply domestic law, referencing UNCITRAL Art. 35(1) and the BIT's applicable law clause. However, it *does not* mention or discuss the ICSID Convention Article 42 (which governs jurisdiction over counterclaims arising from the same subject matter in ICSID cases) or analogous custom regarding the incorporation of domestic law into the tribunal's mandate in a non-ICSID (UNCITRAL) context.
