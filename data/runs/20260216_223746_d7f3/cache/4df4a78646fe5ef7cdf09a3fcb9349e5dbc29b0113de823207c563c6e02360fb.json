The candidate answer discusses priority based on actual occupation, notice, and whether the advance was optional or obligatory under the Land Registration Act 2002 framework (England & Wales). It focuses on whether the lender's charge *has* priority over the equitable interest, which is the correct legal battleground, but it does not explicitly state the absolute rule that a registered charge *cannot* overreach an unprotected beneficial interest simply because the title holder is a sole proprietor. In fact, the answer implies the opposite: that a properly registered charge *will* usually take priority unless specific exceptions (like actual occupation overriding interests or lack of notice for optional advances) apply. Therefore, the specific assertion required by the criterion is not made.\", \"criterion_id\": \"56903d4e-63dc-4bc3-85b3-6931cd0ed7b8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2473, "completion_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 2701}, "latency_s": 2.540252499980852, "request_id": "ABmVae3lE-W1vdIPpY7RsQw", "raw_response": null}
