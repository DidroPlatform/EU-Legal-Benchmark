The candidate answer explicitly addresses the jurisdictional challenge by arguing that the tribunal's jurisdiction is established by the valid arbitration agreement and that the French injunction did not divest the tribunal of jurisdiction (Section 2, point 2). Furthermore, the entire structure of the defense relies on the premise that the Paris tribunal *did* validly rule on jurisdiction, which is the essence of the competence-competence principle being upheld. The response does not state that only courts can decide jurisdiction; rather, it defends the jurisdiction already asserted by the tribunal.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9495db3e-2861-45da-a1e2-0b1f7bdac2f6\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2649, "completion_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 2837}, "latency_s": 1.2000752910389565, "request_id": "EuuUacOzDP75-8YPoLKJgAY", "raw_response": null}
