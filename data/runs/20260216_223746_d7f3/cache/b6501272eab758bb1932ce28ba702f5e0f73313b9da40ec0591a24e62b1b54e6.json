The candidate answer focuses entirely on jurisdictional strategy, arbitration procedure, governing law conflicts, and litigation management (anti-suit relief, expert strategy, etc.). It analyzes the *claims* (termination, security vulnerabilities) but never assesses the *merits* of the client's position regarding breach or non-breach. In fact, the strategy section suggests building a case that the termination was pretextual and that the client complied with contractual mechanics, which implies a defense against breach, but it does not affirmatively state that the facts *do not indicate* a valid breach. The response fails to address the factual basis of the breach allegation as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d5afc437-3642-4325-9116-f62d2335c899\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3273, "completion_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 3480}, "latency_s": 0.8319755829870701, "request_id": "DR-VaZDjLtWbkdUPueCoyAM", "raw_response": null}
