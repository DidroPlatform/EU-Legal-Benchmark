The candidate answer focuses entirely on jurisdictional issues and developing a strategy for the arbitration (defending against the security vulnerability claim, gathering evidence of alternative motivation, understanding Delaware law). It does not explicitly state or analyze whether the client's termination (or the German firm's termination, as the prompt states the Germans terminated) was a valid breach.
