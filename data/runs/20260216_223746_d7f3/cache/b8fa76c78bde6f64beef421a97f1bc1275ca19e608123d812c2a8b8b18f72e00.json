The response discusses foreign tax credits extensively, mentioning the GILTI basket and the general limitation under \\u00a7904, but it explicitly states regarding excess GILTI credits: \\\"those excess credits are neither refundable nor carryable to other years under current law (\\u00a7904(c) does not permit carryforward or carryback of GILTI basket credits, a point that is sometimes overlooked).\\\" While the general rule for *non-GILTI* foreign tax credits (e.g., passive or general basket income not subject to GILTI rules) allows for a one-year carryback under \\u00a7904(c), the response focuses on the GILTI basket and incorrectly implies or states that carryback is unavailable for GILTI credits, and it fails to affirmatively state the one-year carryback rule for the general basket credits that are relevant to the analysis (e.g., interest income if it fell into the general basket). Since the criterion specifically asks about the general basket carryback, and the response focuses on the inapplicability of carryback for GILTI credits, it does not satisfy the requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"528e0cf1-1410-4005-a69e-7720dfc5094d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4350, "completion_tokens": 318, "total_tokens": 4668}, "latency_s": 1.228741250000894, "request_id": "wcWUab6oD-OXkdUPwKDLyAM", "raw_response": null}
