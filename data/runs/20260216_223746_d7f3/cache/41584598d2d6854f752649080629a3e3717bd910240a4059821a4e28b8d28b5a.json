It was agreed upon in February 2023. Here's a breakdown of how it works and the key points you asked about:\n\n## Northern Ireland's Status\n\nNorthern Ireland is effectively in both the UK and EU markets for goods. This means that goods can move freely between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (which is part of the EU) without checks at the border. However, goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are subject to checks and controls to ensure they comply with EU rules if they are at risk of entering the EU's single market.\n\n## Safeguards\n\nThe Windsor Framework includes several safeguards to protect the integrity of the EU's single market and to ensure that goods moving through Northern Ireland comply with the relevant regulations. These include:\n\n1. **Checks and Controls**: Goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are subject to checks and controls to ensure they comply with EU rules if they are at risk of entering the EU's single market.\n\n2. **Market Surveillance**: There are provisions for market surveillance to ensure that goods on the Northern Ireland market comply with EU rules.\n\n3. **Dispute Resolution**: The framework includes mechanisms for resolving disputes between the UK and the EU regarding the implementation of the agreement.\n\n## The Stormont Brake\n\nThe Stormont brake is a mechanism that allows the Northern Ireland Assembly to have a say in the application of new EU goods rules in Northern Ireland. If a significant number of members of the Assembly object to a new rule, it can be blocked from applying in Northern Ireland. This was a key demand of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who had been boycotting the Northern Ireland Assembly over concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n\n## Burden of Proof for Goods at Risk\n\nUnder the Windsor Framework, goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are presumed to be at risk of entering the EU's single market unless they are specifically designated as not at risk. This means that the burden of proof is on the trader to show that goods are not at risk of entering the EU's single market.\n\nFor goods coming from third countries (like China), they would be subject to the same rules as goods coming from Great Britain. If they are imported into Northern Ireland and are at risk of entering the EU's single market, they would be subject to checks and controls to ensure they comply with EU rules.\n\n## Primary Sources\n\nThe key documents related to the Windsor Framework are:\n\n1. **The Windsor Framework**: This is the main agreement between the UK and the EU, agreed upon in February 2023.\n\n2. **The Northern Ireland Protocol**: This is part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU's single market for goods to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.\n\n3. **The Stormont Brake**: This is a mechanism outlined in the Windsor Framework that allows the Northern Ireland Assembly to have a say in the application of new EU goods rules in Northern Ireland.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official documents and statements from the UK and EU governments.\n\nI hope this helps you explain the Windsor Framework to your student!
