{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 0, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires a concrete registration tax breakdown for the compromesso (e.g., 200\\u20ac, 0.5%, 3%, etc.). The candidate answer mentions registration tax generally in section 5, stating: \\\"If buying from a private seller: usually registration tax (often 2% \\u201cprima casa\\u201d or 9% non\\u2013prima casa on cadastral value, with fixed mortgage/cadastral taxes)\\\" and mentions registration in section 8. However, this description pertains to the tax due upon the *registration* of the preliminary contract, not the specific breakdown of the registration tax itself (which usually involves a fixed fee of \\u20ac200 plus a percentage of the deposit/down payment, or a fixed fee if VAT applies). The answer provides percentages (2% or 9%) which relate to the registration tax on the deposit/down payment, but it does not explicitly mention the mandatory fixed fee of \\u20ac200 often associated with registering the compromesso, nor does it clearly separate the fixed fees from the percentage fees as implied by the criterion's examples (200\\u20ac, 0.5%, 3%). Since the required concrete breakdown including the fixed fee is missing or insufficiently detailed, the criterion is not strictly met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"40c39bd-4a31-4cdb-84b7-89f2ebc16228\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2433, "completion_tokens": 340, "total_tokens": 2773}, "latency_s": 1.2495802079793066, "request_id": "FRaVacaQOYa8xN8Puu-IoAo", "raw_response": null}
