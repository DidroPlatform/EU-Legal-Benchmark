The candidate answer discusses strategy regarding damages, specifically mentioning invoking limitation of liability and exclusion of consequential damages (which reputation harm often is) under Delaware law (Section 3.D and 7.5). However, it does not explicitly state or analyze the *high burden of proof threshold* required for the German distributor to *prove* their damages claim in the first place, which is what the criterion asks for. The focus is on contractual defenses against damages rather than the evidentiary difficulty of proving the underlying loss.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d00808cb-d679-4896-825b-ae9319778964\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3280, "completion_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 3465}, "latency_s": 0.8153113750158809, "request_id": "IR-VaZ7pLPujkdUP0fjD0QU", "raw_response": null}
