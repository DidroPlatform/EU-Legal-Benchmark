Section 5.3, under the 'Parody Defense \\u2013 U.S. vs. Italy' table, explicitly discusses the US fair use defense for parody, noting that 'Parody must comment on the original; commercial use is not per se fatal but is a negative factor.' Furthermore, Section 5.1 states that 'Parody is a recognized defense, but commercial sale of T-shirts is heavily weighed against fair use.' This directly addresses the possibility of protection under US fair use parody for the mocking shirt.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a08540da-4efa-444f-a6e5-0bd865227bb8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4479, "completion_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 4663}, "latency_s": 1.0669547080178745, "request_id": "pPOUaeK_MKSDkdUP5IaYkQM", "raw_response": null}
