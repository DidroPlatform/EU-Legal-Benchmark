The candidate response suggests obtaining a 'UK Binding Tariff Information (BTI)' or an 'Origin Ruling' from HMRC. While a BTI/Origin Ruling is a specific administrative tool used to clarify classification or origin, it is not listed among the examples provided in the criterion ('new shipper review', 'scope ruling', 'sunset review'), which typically refer to anti-dumping/countervailing duty proceedings or specific customs classification reviews outside of standard pre-clearance rulings.
