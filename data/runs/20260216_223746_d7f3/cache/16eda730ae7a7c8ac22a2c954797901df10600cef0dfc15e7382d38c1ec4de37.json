The candidate answer explicitly addresses this in Section 3 ('Honest but Mistaken Belief in the Need for Force') and Section 4.1 ('Strengths of the Self-Defence Argument'), noting that the subjective belief (even if mistaken) is sufficient under s. 76(3) CJIA 2008 and case law (Williams). Furthermore, Section 2.B.2 and Section 4.1.3 specifically mention that the court must consider the 'heat of the moment' and that the defendant is not expected to make 'fine judgments' about the level of force, which directly covers the requirement to direct the jury on the client's position in the heat of the moment regarding the mistaken use of force.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3638b3ae-0c64-4892-b3cc-fc12739096a1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4178, "completion_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 4425}, "latency_s": 1.4381438750424422, "request_id": "M_eUaaiSAtz07M8PwPSugQU", "raw_response": null}
