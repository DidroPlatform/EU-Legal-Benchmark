The candidate correctly identifies statement E as incorrect, which aligns with the reference answer (as E is missing from the reference, implying it is incorrect or not covered, but the candidate's reasoning for E being incorrect is sound based on Swiss media law principles regarding justiciability).\\n\\nCrucially, the candidate identifies statement D as CORRECT, while the reference answer omits D, implying D is incorrect. The reference answer lists A, B, C, and E as correct statements. \\n\\nLet's re-evaluate D based on the reference answer's implicit judgment:\\nReference says A, B, C, E are correct. D is omitted, implying D is incorrect.\\nCandidate says A, B, C, D are correct, E is incorrect.\\n\\nIf the reference answer is the ground truth:\\nReference Correct: A, B, C, E\\nReference Incorrect: D\\n\\nCandidate Assessment:\\nA: Correct (Match)\\nB: Correct (Match)\\nC: Correct (Match)\\nD: Correct (Mismatch - Candidate says Correct, Reference implies Incorrect)\\nE: Incorrect (Mismatch - Candidate says Incorrect, Reference says Correct)\\n\\nRevisiting E: The reference states E is correct: \\\"In Switzerland, the constitutional principles of accurate presentation of events and diversity of opinion are justiciable and enforceable against any radio and television broadcaster established in Switzerland.\\\" The candidate argues E is incorrect because 'accurate presentation' is not explicitly constitutional and content duties are generally not directly justiciable under Art. 93. The candidate's reasoning for E being incorrect is legally more precise regarding direct justiciability of content duties under Art. 93 compared to the blanket assertion in the reference answer that E is correct. However, in a reference-based evaluation, if the reference states E is correct, the candidate's assessment of E as incorrect is a deviation.\\n\\nRevisiting D: The reference omits D, implying it is incorrect. The candidate states D is correct, arguing the democracy-functional view ignores economic differences. The candidate's reasoning for D being correct is sound (Art. 93 focuses on political function, not economic structure). If D is indeed incorrect (as implied by the reference), the candidate is wrong on D.\\n\\nGiven the significant mismatches (D and E) between the candidate's assessment and the reference's implicit assessment, the score must be lowered, despite the candidate's strong reasoning for E being incorrect.\\n\\nCandidate Errors (based on reference truth): D (Incorrectly marked Correct), E (Incorrectly marked Incorrect).\\n\\nScore adjustment: 5 correct statements assessed, 3 matches (A, B, C). 2 mismatches (D, E). (3/5) * 1.0 = 0.6. Since the candidate provided detailed reasoning, I will slightly adjust upwards for quality, but the factual deviation from the reference answer is significant.\\n\\nI will score based on the number of matches against the reference set {A, B, C, E} being correct and {D} being incorrect.\\nMatches: A", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1987, "completion_tokens": 700, "total_tokens": 2687}, "latency_s": 3.0731794579769485, "request_id": "NvSUabPKK9qfnsEPzfyNyAM", "raw_response": null}
