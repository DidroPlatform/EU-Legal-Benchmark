The candidate answer explicitly addresses the VAT issue under 'CRISIS 2: THE VAT EXPOSURE' and states that if a third-party IOR is used (Option B), the import VAT flows through their books, and the client reimburses them. While it doesn't use the exact phrase 'back-to-back sales contract,' the mechanism described—the third-party IOR accounting for the VAT and the client reimbursing them—is the operational equivalent of a back-to-back arrangement necessary to manage the VAT liability when the French parent is not the direct importer of record. The structure described in the Phase 1 diagram confirms this flow: French Parent sells to Retailer (commercial sale), while the IOR handles the customs/VAT declaration, necessitating a clear commercial agreement (the back-to-back contract) to manage the flow of the VAT cost.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2941285f-f638-4e87-9944-0cebd24bc52b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4389, "completion_tokens": 261, "total_tokens": 4650}, "latency_s": 2.0445719589770306, "request_id": "1beUaeTpB9GxnsEPuvytyAM", "raw_response": null}
