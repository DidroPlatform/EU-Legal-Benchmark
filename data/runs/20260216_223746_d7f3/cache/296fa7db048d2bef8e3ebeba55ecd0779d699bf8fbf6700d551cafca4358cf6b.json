Article 64 of the 1874 Federal Constitution did authorize federal legislation on obligations, commercial law, exchange law, civil capacity, copyright, debt enforcement and bankruptcy. This is correct.\\n\\nii. A contract is void if there is a defect in its conclusion - this is not necessarily correct in Swiss law. Defects in the conclusion of a contract (such as error, fraud, or duress) generally make the contract voidable (anfechtbar), not void (nichtig). However, some defects like impossibility or illegality make it void. The statement as written is too broad but could be interpreted as referring to certain fundamental defects. This is a borderline statement, but in Swiss law the general principle is that defects in consent make contracts voidable, not void. However, the statement could also be read as referring to formal defects or other issues. On balance, this statement is arguably incorrect because defects in conclusion typically lead to voidability, not voidness.\\n\\niii. This statement about criminal law is correct. Under Art. 335 of the Swiss Criminal Code, cantons retain the power to legislate on contraventions (minor offenses) that are not covered by federal legislation. This is an accurate statement.\\n\\niv. Under Art. 197 ZGB, acquired property comprises assets acquired for valuable consideration during the marital property regime. This is correct.\\n\\nv. The Federal Council consists of seven members of equal rank - there is no Prime Minister. The Federal President is merely primus inter pares and rotates annually. The Federal President cannot dissolve the Federal Assembly. This statement is clearly INCORRECT.\\n\\nWait, let me reconsider statement ii more carefully. In Swiss law (OR Art. 19-20), contracts with impossible or illegal content are void. But defects in declaration of intent (error, fraud, duress - OR Art. 23-31) make contracts voidable. The statement says 'a contract is void if there is a defect in the conclusion of it' - this is too sweeping and incorrect as a general rule.\\n\\nBut reconsidering: if only statement v is clearly incorrect, and statement ii is debatable, the answer might be just D (v only). Looking at the options again, statement ii's incorrectness depends on interpretation. In many Swiss law courses, the distinction between void and voidable is emphasized, making ii incorrect.\\n\\nHowever, given the answer choices available and that statement v is definitively wrong, while ii could be debated, the safest answer focusing on clearly incorrect statements is D (v only).\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 581, "completion_tokens": 593, "total_tokens": 1174}, "latency_s": 12.886104750010418, "request_id": "chatcmpl-648a31de-e01e-4b05-9f55-9aa1d402e711", "raw_response": null}
