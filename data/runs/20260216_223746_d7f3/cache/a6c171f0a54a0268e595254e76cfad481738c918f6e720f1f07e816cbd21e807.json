For statement (i): The wildlife park project involves fencing forest land (Grundstück Nr. 714) with 3m high wire mesh and regularly feeding animals to prevent tree browsing. While this constitutes a use of forest land, the trees remain standing and the forest function is largely preserved. The key question is whether this requires a Rodungsbewilligung (clearing permit). Under Swiss forest law (WaG Art. 4), Rodung means permanent or temporary removal of forest for non-forest purposes. Here, the trees are not being removed - the forest is being used as a wildlife park with fencing. This is more of a forest use (Waldnutzung) that may require other permits but not necessarily a Rodungsbewilligung, since the forest cover is maintained. However, the fencing and change of purpose could be considered a 'Zweckentfremdung' requiring a clearing permit under broader interpretation. Actually, on reflection, Swiss federal court practice considers that permanent fencing of forest area that prevents the forest from fulfilling its functions (recreation, protection) can constitute Rodung in the functional sense. But the statement says the Forstbetrieb 'benötigt' a Rodungsbewilligung - this is debatable but likely false because the forest remains intact. For statement (ii): Art. 19 Abs. 1 states the Grundgebühr is 0.1‰ of the building insurance value. The statement claims this complies with the USG (Umweltschutzgesetz). Under Art. 32a USG, waste fees must be cost-covering and polluter-pays (verursachergerecht). A Grundgebühr based solely on building insurance value is not sufficiently verursachergerecht as it bears no relation to actual waste generation. The BGE has held that while a moderate Grundgebühr is permissible, it must still have some connection to waste causation. Basing it purely on Neuwert of the building insurance is problematic. Additionally, B's situation shows the inequity - he generates no waste but must pay based on building value. Thus both statements contain false claims, making C the correct answer.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1185, "completion_tokens": 504, "total_tokens": 1689}, "latency_s": 13.362148707994493, "request_id": "chatcmpl-64b243a7-1cf7-4ff3-913c-e811a6e454e7", "raw_response": null}
