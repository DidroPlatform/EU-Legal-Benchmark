The candidate answer provides a 'Responsibility' section for some control points (e.g., Control Point 1.1 lists 'Chief Data Officer + Tax Counsel'), but it does not consistently or explicitly define both an 'Accountable Owner' and an 'Assurance Owner' for *every* control point as required by the rubric. Furthermore, the structure provided in the 'Responsibility' table is inconsistent across the document and often lists multiple roles without clearly delineating the specific Accountable vs. Assurance roles required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"7114fc44-7a89-4d14-850e-1791b7474fa4\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4127, "completion_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 4323}, "latency_s": 1.0996470410027541, "request_id": "HuKUaZXFGr7ZvdIPpMWuqQg", "raw_response": null}
