It states that intervening acts break the chain if they are 'unforeseeable, voluntary, and sufficiently independent' when discussing the legal causation analysis. This directly satisfies the requirement of the criterion, which focuses on whether the individual's actions are 'unreasonable' or 'unforeseeable' as the key determination for an intervening act.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1428e4a3-9748-453e-a85b-e4bc4b2f0440\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1727, "completion_tokens": 151, "total_tokens": 1878}, "latency_s": 11.218967750028241, "request_id": "TjGVaankJfDm7M8Po7vO6QU", "raw_response": null}
