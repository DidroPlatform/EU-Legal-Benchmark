The scenario involves an injunction from an *unspecified* court (implied to be Indian based on the context of parallel litigation often seen in these problems, though the candidate answer discusses an 'Indian injunction' in Section II.A) that the US supplier relies on to resist enforcement in New York. The candidate answer explicitly argues that the anti-suit injunction (which it frames as potentially Indian) should *not* affect enforcement (Section I.B). Crucially, the candidate answer never asserts that an injunction from *any* court (New York or otherwise) automatically invalidates the award; rather, it argues the opposite: that such injunctions should be disregarded in favor of enforcement. Therefore, the criterion is not met because the response argues against the premise of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"de5ab140-8126-4615-aadf-578d40e44047\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4027, "completion_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 4258}, "latency_s": 1.063018250017194, "request_id": "IM2UacP9MdX1kdUPq5K00AM", "raw_response": null}
