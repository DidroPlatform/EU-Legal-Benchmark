It correctly cites and distinguishes the key UK Supreme Court cases, *Stone & Rolls v Moore Stephens* and *Bilta (UK) Ltd v Nazir*. The analysis correctly concludes that due to the presence of innocent shareholders (Eden Sharehan) and creditors, the fraudulent conduct of the sole director (Achille Taloon) should not be attributed to the company for the purpose of defeating the auditor's liability claim, aligning with the modern interpretation of the defense post-*Bilta*. The reference answer also reaches the correct conclusion that the defense will likely fail, although it relies on slightly older or less detailed reasoning regarding the duty owed to shareholders/creditors. The candidate answer is comprehensive, legally precise, and directly addresses the prompt using the correct legal framework (English law).\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.95}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1974, "completion_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 2195}, "latency_s": 1.1295464170107152, "request_id": "XtWUafLEIumekdUPoPLrcQ", "raw_response": null}
