The candidate answer discusses concepts like 'Adverse Possession' and 'Tolerated Trespasser' which relate to property rights derived from long-term, non-tenancy occupation, but it never explicitly defines or explains the legal requirements of 'actual occupation' itself, which is a specific term often used in relation to overriding interests in land registration (e.g., under the Land Registration Act 2002).
