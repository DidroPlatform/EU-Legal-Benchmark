UK PE RISK FOR THE LP\n\n### Why the deal team is arguing\n\nA Dutch CV (commanditaire vennootschap) that is *open* (open CV) is treated as opaque for Dutch tax purposes. A *closed* CV is transparent. This distinction is existential to the entire structure.\n\n**If the CV is a closed CV (besloten CV):**\n- Fiscally transparent in the Netherlands — the LP is looked through as the income recipient\n- The NL-SG treaty is unavailable because the CV is not a \"resident of the Netherlands\" for treaty purposes (no Dutch tax liability on the income at entity level)\n- The royalties are attributed directly to the UK LP — you've achieved nothing\n\n**If the CV is an open CV:**\n- Opaque for Dutch tax purposes, treated as a corporate body subject to Dutch CIT\n- Can in principle be a Netherlands treaty resident and claim NL-SG treaty benefits\n- But this is where the PE risk crystallises\n\n### The PE analysis under the UK-NL treaty (2008, as amended)\n\nThe question is whether the CV's activities create a **UK PE of the CV** or, more critically from your client's perspective, whether HMRC treats the arrangement as the **LP carrying on business through the CV in a way that doesn't shift the taxing right**.\n\n**Fixed place of business PE (Art. 5(1)):** If the CV has genuine substance in the Netherlands — office, employees, decision-making — and *no* fixed place in the UK through which it conducts business, there is no UK PE of the CV. The risk here is low *if* the CV is genuinely managed and operated from NL.\n\n**Dependent agent PE (Art. 5(5)):** This is the real battleground. If any person in the UK is:\n- habitually concluding contracts on behalf of the CV, or\n- habitually playing the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification by the CV\n\nthen the CV has a UK PE. Under the MLI (which both UK and NL have ratified), the expanded Art. 5(5) language applies. If the LP's UK-based principals are negotiating the licence, setting royalty rates, and the Dutch CV is merely signing what's put in front of it, HMRC will argue dependent agent PE.\n\n**The reverse question — does the CV create a PE *of the LP* in NL?** This is less concerning for your client commercially but matters for Dutch tax: if the LP is transparent for UK purposes and the partners are UK tax resident, the Dutch activities of the CV don't typically create a Dutch PE of the UK partners unless the partners themselves are acting through a fixed place in NL.\n\n### What actually matters to HMRC\n\nHMRC's practical concern is simpler: **is the CV a brass plate?** Under the UK's domestic anti-avoidance framework:\n\n- **TIOPA 2010, Part 4 (transfer pricing):** HMRC can re-price the royalty flow if the CV is interposed without economic substance and the royalty rate doesn't reflect arm's length terms.\n- **GAAR (FA 2013, Part 5):** If the arrangement is abusive — i.e., the CV exists solely to treaty-shop — HMRC can counteract the tax advantage. The GAAR Advisory Panel has flagged treaty shopping structures.\n- **Diverted Profits Tax (FA 2015, Part 3):** If the CV lacks economic substance relative to the functions it supposedly performs, and the arrangement results in a UK tax reduction, DPT at 25% (now aligned with CT rate, but the compliance mechanism is distinct and punitive) can apply.\n\n---\n\n## 2. WILL THE TREATY BENEFIT HOLD UP?\n\n### NL-SG Treaty: Royalty Withholding\n\nThe Netherlands-Singapore treaty (2009) provides for **0% withholding on royalties** (Art. 12). This is the prize. Singapore's domestic rate is 10%.\n\n### Beneficial Ownership (Art. 12 read with commentary)\n\nSingapore's IRAS will scrutinise whether the Dutch CV is the **beneficial owner** of the royalties. Post-BEPS (Action 6), the beneficial ownership concept has been tightened:\n\n- If the CV receives royalties and is **contractually or practically obligated** to pass them on to the UK LP (or its partners), the CV is a conduit and not the beneficial owner.\n- The CV must have the **right to use and enjoy** the royalties, bearing real economic risk, and must not be acting as a mere agent or nominee.\n\n**Key indicators IRAS and the Dutch Belastingdienst will examine:**\n- Does the CV have the right to sub-license or refuse to license?\n- Does the CV bear credit risk on the Singaporean licensee?\n- Does the CV retain a meaningful margin, or does substantially all income flow upstream?\n- Does the CV have employees with relevant expertise to manage the IP portfolio?\n- Was the CV interposed contemporaneously with the licence negotiation?\n\n### Principal Purpose Test (PPT) — MLI Art. 7\n\nBoth Netherlands and Singapore are MLI signatories. The PPT applies to the NL-SG treaty. If **one of the principal purposes** of the arrangement is to obtain the treaty benefit (0% royalty WHT), and granting that benefit would not be in accordance with the object and purpose of the treaty, the benefit is denied.\n\nThis is a lower threshold than \"sole or main purpose.\" Given that the CV is being interposed specifically to route royalties through the NL-SG treaty rather than the UK-SG treaty (which provides **10% WHT on royalties** under Art. 12 of the UK-SG DTA), the PPT is a serious risk. The delta between 10% and 0% is the entire commercial rationale for the CV — which is precisely what the PPT is designed to catch.\n\n### Dutch Substance Requirements\n\nThe Netherlands has codified minimum substance requirements for holding/licensing entities to access treaty benefits (Decree of 2014, updated). The CV must have:\n\n- At least €100,000 in wage costs for relevant employees in NL\n- Office space in NL at its disposal for at least 24 months\n- At least 50% of the board/management resident in NL\n- Decision-making on the licensing activity taking place in NL\n- The CV must not be a conduit (doorstroomvennootschap) — if it is, it must meet enhanced substance requirements and may be subject to exchange of information with treaty partners\n\nIf the CV fails these, the Dutch tax authorities themselves will not issue a tax residency certificate, and the structure collapses at the first gate.\n\n---\n\n## 3. NET ASSESSMENT\n\n| Risk | Severity | Likelihood if CV is thin |\n|---|---|---|\n| CV = UK PE of LP (or LP acting through CV) | High — full UK taxation of royalties | **Medium-High** if UK principals drive deal-making |\n| Beneficial ownership challenge by IRAS | High — 10% WHT reinstated | **High** if CV is a pass-through |\n| PPT denial of NL-SG treaty benefit | High — 0% rate denied | **High** — the structure's purpose is self-evident |\n| Dutch substance failure | Fatal — no residency cert | **Medium** — fixable with spend, but expensive |\n| UK GAAR / DPT | Punitive | **Medium** — depends on overall fact pattern |\n\n---\n\n## 4. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n**If the deal team insists on this structure:**\n\n1. **The CV must be real.** Employees in NL with genuine IP management expertise. Board in NL. Decisions made in NL. This costs real money — budget €300K-500K/year minimum in substance costs. If the royalty flow doesn't justify that, the structure is uneconomic.\n\n2. **The CV must own or co-own the IP, not merely sub-license it.** An outright transfer or a cost-sharing arrangement where the CV bears development risk is far more defensible than a back-to-back licence. But this triggers UK exit charges (TCGA 1992 / CTA 2009 on IP disposals) and transfer pricing scrutiny on the transfer price.\n\n3. **UK-based personnel must not negotiate or conclude the Singapore licence.** All substantive negotiation must be conducted by NL-resident individuals acting for the CV. Any UK involvement must be limited to oversight at the LP partner level, not operational deal-making.\n\n4. **The CV must retain meaningful income.** A thin spread (e.g., 5% margin) will be attacked. The CV needs to retain a return commensurate with the functions, assets, and risks it genuinely bears.\n\n5. **Get an advance ruling from the Belastingdienst** confirming Dutch tax residency and substance. Consider approaching IRAS for confirmation on beneficial ownership, though Singapore is less forthcoming on informal rulings.\n\n**The uncomfortable truth:**\n\nThe UK-SG treaty already provides a 10% royalty WHT rate. The cost of standing up a genuinely substantive Dutch CV, defending it against PPT and beneficial ownership challenges, and managing the UK PE / DPT risk may well exceed the 10% WHT saving — especially after Dutch CIT on the royalty income retained in the CV (25.8% headline rate on profits above €200K).\n\nRun the numbers on the **after-all-tax cost** of the Dutch route versus simply licensing directly from the UK LP to the Singaporean pubco under the UK-SG treaty. In many cases, the direct route is cheaper, simpler, and doesn't carry litigation risk.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The PE risk is manageable but expensive to mitigate. The treaty benefit is fragile — the PPT is the structure's most likely point of failure, and it's the one you can't engineer around with substance alone, because the purpose of the interposition is transparent. I'd push back on the deal team and make them justify the economics net of all costs and risks.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 89, "completion_tokens": 2404, "total_tokens": 2493}, "latency_s": 60.82674358302029, "request_id": "chatcmpl-8c0fec55-01a6-443e-9a48-bd25de5dd22e", "raw_response": null}
