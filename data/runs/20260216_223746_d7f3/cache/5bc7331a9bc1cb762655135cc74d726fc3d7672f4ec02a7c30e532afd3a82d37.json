A petition, a medical‑psychological report, proof of identity/relationship and a draft “decreto di nomina” are filed.  If appointed, the guardian can act only on the matters expressly authorised by the judge, must keep a transparent accounting, file an annual report, and may be paid (subject to the judge’s approval).  The measure is reversible if the assistito’s condition improves.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Legal framework (in a nutshell)\n\n| Law / Decree | What it regulates |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| **Law 6/2004** (and subsequent amendments, e.g., Law 69/2019) | Introduces the *amministrazione di sostegno* as the default protective measure, replacing the older “interdizione”/“inabilitazione”. |\n| **Art. 404‑413 c.c.** (Italian Civil Code) | Sets out the judge’s powers, the content of the decree, the duties of the guardian, and the reporting/termination rules. |\n| **Decreto Legge 13/2020** (COVID‑19 emergency) | Temporarily broadened the possibility of remote medical certificates – still useful to know for “tele‑visite” documentation. |\n| **Regolamento del Consiglio Superiore della Magistratura (CSM) – 2021** | Provides procedural check‑lists for the tribunale (court) that handles the case. |\n\nThe **tribunale per i minori e le famiglie** (or the civil section of the local tribunal) is the competent court. The judge who decides is called the **giudice tutelare**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the judge decides whether to grant *amministrazione di sostegno*\n\n### 2.1 Core criteria (Art. 404 c.c.)\n\n1. **Loss of capacity** – The assistito must have a *significant* reduction in mental, physical, or sensory abilities that prevents him/her from:\n   * managing personal finances, property, or contracts; **or**\n   * taking care of health‑related decisions (e.g., consenting to treatment, choosing a caregiver).\n\n2. **Preservation of autonomy** – The loss must *not* be total. The person must still be able to:\n   * express wishes and preferences;  \n   * understand, at least partially, the consequences of the decisions that the guardian will take on his/her behalf.\n\n3. **Proportionality & least‑restrictive‑measure principle** – The judge must choose the *narrowest* set of powers that actually solves the problem.  \n   * Example: If the only difficulty is paying bills, the decree can limit the guardian to “gestione dei conti correnti e pagamento delle spese correnti”.\n\n4. **Absence of conflict of interest** – The prospective guardian must not have a personal interest that could conflict with the assistito’s best interests (e.g., being a creditor, a potential heir who would benefit from a sale).\n\n### 2.2 The judge’s decision‑making process\n\n| Step | What happens | Who is involved |\n|------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **a. Petition filed** | The interested party (usually a relative) submits a written request to the tribunal. | Petitioner, possibly a lawyer. |\n| **b. Preliminary assessment** | The judge may order a *perizia medica‑psicologica* (medical‑psychological assessment) and, in many cases, a *relazione dei servizi sociali* (social‑services report). | Court‑appointed doctor/psychologist, social worker. |\n| **c. Hearing (Udienza)** | The assistito is invited (or, if incapable, a *rappresentante legale* is invited) to express his/her wishes. The judge also hears the petitioner and any objections. | Assistito, petitioner, possibly a *difensore* (lawyer) for the assistito. |\n| **d. Decision** | The judge issues a *decreto di nomina* (order of appointment) that: <br>• States the factual findings (loss of capacity, medical diagnosis). <br>• Defines the *ambito di attività* (scope) – e.g., “gestione patrimoniale”, “scelta del medico curante”, “rappresentanza in giudizio”. <br>• Names the guardian (or, if none is suitable, appoints a *curatore* from the *Albo dei Curatori*). <br>• Sets the remuneration (if any) and reporting schedule. | Giudice tutelare. |\n| **e. Publication** | The decree is entered in the *registro delle amministrazioni di sostegno* and, for transparency, a copy is sent to the *Ufficio Anagrafe* and to the *Conservatoria dei Registri Immobiliari* (if property is involved). | Court clerk. |\n\n**Key point:** The judge’s decision is *discretionary* but must be *motivated* (i.e., the decree must explain why the measure is necessary and why the chosen scope is appropriate). If the assistito’s condition improves, the same judge (or a higher court) can *revocare* or *modificare* the measure.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Documents normally required for the petition\n\n> **Tip:** Most tribunals provide a printable “modulo di richiesta di amministrazione di sostegno”. The list below follows the standard checklist (Tribunale di Milano, Sezione Civile, 2023).\n\n| Document | Why it’s needed | Typical format |\n|----------|----------------|----------------|\n| **1. Written petition (Domanda)** | Sets out who is requesting, the relationship, the reasons, and the proposed scope of the support. | Typed, signed, and dated. |\n| **2. Identity documents** (carta d’identità/passport, codice fiscale) of: <br>• The assistito <br>• The petitioner (future guardian) | Proves legal capacity and relationship. | Copies (front & back). |\n| **3. Proof of relationship** (e.g., birth certificate, marriage certificate, *certificato di parentela*) | Confirms the familial tie (often a factor the judge weighs). | Certified copy. |\n| **4. Medical‑psychological report** (*relazione medica*) | Core evidence of loss of capacity. Must be issued by a *medico legale*, *neurologo*, *psichiatra* or *geriatra* and include: <br>• Diagnosis (e.g., “demenza di tipo Alzheimer, stadio moderato”). <br>• Functional assessment (what the person can/cannot do). <br>• Prognosis. | Original + 2 copies, signed and stamped. |\n| **5. Social‑services report** (optional but often requested) | Gives a broader view of daily living needs, home situation, and any existing support (e.g., home‑care services). | From *Servizio Sociale* of the *ASL* or *Comune*. |\n| **6. Statement of the assistito** (if possible) | The assistito’s own wishes (e.g., “desidero che sia mio figlio a gestire le mie finanze”). | Written, signed, and witnessed (or recorded in the hearing). |\n| **7. Draft of the *decreto* (optional)** | Some tribunals allow the petitioner to propose the exact wording of the scope; the judge can adopt it or modify it. | Typed, with bullet points of powers. |\n| **8. Financial overview** (optional but useful) | List of assets, bank accounts, properties, debts, pensions, etc. Helps the judge gauge the complexity of the administration. | Spreadsheet or simple table. |\n| **9. Power of attorney (if already in place)** | If a *procura speciale* exists, the judge will consider whether it suffices or needs to be replaced by *amministrazione di sostegno*. | Copy of the procura. |\n| **10. Receipt of filing fee** (≈ € 100‑150, varies by tribunal) | Court fees are required unless the petitioner is exempt (e.g., low income). | Payment receipt. |\n\n**Additional notes**\n\n* All documents must be **translated into Italian** if originally in another language, and the translation must be *certified* (traduzione giurata).  \n* If the assistito is *non‑resident* (e.g., lives abroad), you’ll also need a *certificato di residenza* or *certificato di domicilio* issued by the foreign authority and an *apostille*.\n\n---\n\n## 4. What the guardian (amministratore di sostegno) is allowed – and required – to do\n\n### 4.1 Scope of powers (set by the decree)\n\nThe decree can be **general** (e.g., “gestione di tutti gli interessi patrimoniali e sanitari”) or **specific** (e.g., “solo pagamento delle bollette e gestione del conto corrente”). Typical categories:\n\n| Category | Typical activities | Example limits |\n|----------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Patrimoniali** (financial) | • Opening/closing bank accounts <br>• Paying utilities, taxes, medical bills <br>• Receiving pensions, social benefits <br>• Buying/selling immovable property (only if expressly allowed) | May be limited to “solo pagamento delle spese correnti”. |\n| **Sanitari** (health) | • Choosing doctors, hospitals, and treatments <br>• Giving consent for surgeries or medication <br>• Managing home‑care contracts | May be limited to “solo autorizzazione a trattamenti di routine”. |\n| **Giuridici** (legal) | • Representing the assistito in court (e.g., for debt collection) <br>• Signing contracts for services (e.g., phone, internet) | May exclude “rappresentanza in giudizio per cause penali”. |\n| **Personali** (personal) | • Deciding on residence (e.g., move to a nursing home) <br>• Authorising visits of family members | Usually left to the assistito’s wishes, unless the decree says otherwise. |\n\n**Important:** The guardian **cannot** do anything *outside* the powers granted. If a new need arises (e.g., the assistito wants to sell a house), the guardian must **request a modification** of the decree from the judge.\n\n### 4.2 Core duties\n\n| Duty | What it means in practice |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Act in the best interest of the assistito** | Decisions must be motivated by the assistito’s welfare, not by the guardian’s convenience or profit. |\n| **Respect the assistito’s wishes** (as far as they are coherent) | Even if the assistito is partially incapacitated, the guardian must try to follow expressed preferences, unless they conflict with health or legal safety. |\n| **Maintain a transparent accounting** | • Keep a *registro delle operazioni* (chronological list of all receipts and payments). <br>• Keep original invoices, bank statements, and contracts. |\n| **File an annual report** (*relazione annuale*) to the judge | The report must include: <br>• Summary of activities performed. <br>• Balance sheet of assets at the beginning and end of the year. <br>• Any extraordinary transactions. |\n| **Submit a *verbale di rendicontazione* (accounting statement) within 30 days of the annual report** | The judge may appoint a *curatore* or a *commercialista* to verify the accounts. |\n| **Avoid conflicts of interest** | The guardian cannot: <br>• Purchase assets from the assistito at a price below market. <br>• Accept gifts or commissions related to the administration. |\n| **Seek judicial authorization for “atti di disposizione”** (major disposals) | For sales, mortgages, or any transaction that reduces the patrimony by more than a threshold (often € 5,000, but the decree can set a different amount). |\n| **Inform the assistito’s family (if appropriate)** | While not a legal requirement, good practice is to keep close relatives updated, especially if the guardian is a son/daughter. |\n| **Maintain confidentiality** | Personal health data and financial details must be kept private, except when disclosed to the judge or authorized professionals. |\n\n### 4.3 Remuneration\n\n* The guardian **may be paid** a *compenso* approved by the judge.  \n* The amount is usually **proportional to the workload** and the value of the assets managed (e.g., € 0.5‑1.0 per hour, or a fixed € 200‑€ 500 per month for simple cases).  \n* If the guardian is a family member, the judge may **reduce or waive** the fee, especially if the assistito’s assets are modest.  \n* The compensation must be **included in the annual report** and is subject to tax (IRPEF) like any other professional income.\n\n### 4.4 Liability\n\n| Type of liability | When it can arise |\n|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Civil liability** | If the guardian mismanages funds, makes unauthorized disposals, or neglects health decisions, the assistito (or his/her heirs) can sue for damages. |\n| **Criminal liability** | *Truffa*, *appropriazione indebita*, or *abuso di potere* can lead to criminal prosecution. |\n| **Administrative sanctions** | The judge can **revocare** the appointment, **suspend** the guardian, or order restitution of assets. |\n\n**Insurance tip:** Many professional guardians (e.g., lawyers, notaries) carry *polizza di responsabilità civile*; a family member can also purchase a private policy for a modest premium.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical checklist for your friend (step‑by‑step)\n\n| Step | Action | Who should do it / where |\n|------|--------|--------------------------|\n| **1. Preliminary medical evaluation** | Book an appointment with the family doctor/geriatrist → request a *certificato medico* that states the diagnosis and functional limitations. | Assistito (or family) + doctor. |\n| **2. Social‑services assessment** (optional but helpful) | Contact the *Servizio Sociale* of the local *ASL* or *Comune* and ask for a *relazione* on daily living needs. | Family. |\n| **3. Draft the petition** | Use the tribunal’s template; clearly state: <br>• Relationship, <br>• Reason for request, <br>• Desired scope (e.g., “gestione del conto corrente, pagamento delle spese mediche, scelta del medico curante”). | Either the petitioner alone (if comfortable) or a *avvocato* (recommended). |\n| **4. Gather documents** | Identity, relationship proof, medical report, social report, asset list, any existing procura, filing fee receipt. | Family. |\n| **5. File the petition** | Submit at the *Ufficio del Giudice Tutelare* of the local tribunal (usually in person; some tribunals now accept *PEC* email). | Petitioner (or lawyer). |\n| **6. Attend the hearing** | Bring the assistito (if possible) and be ready to answer the judge’s questions. | Guardian‑to‑be + assistito. |\n| **7. Receive the decree** | Once granted, obtain a copy of the *decreto di nomina*; note the exact wording of the powers and any reporting deadlines. | Guardian. |\n| **8. Set up administrative tools** | <br>• Open a dedicated bank account (if the decree allows). <br>• Collect all bills, contracts, and medical records. <br>• Create a simple ledger (Excel or paper). | Guardian. |\n| **9. File the first annual report** (by 30 April of the following year) | Prepare the *relazione* and *rendicontazione*; submit to the judge’s office. | Guardian (or a commercialista). |\n| **10. Review & adjust** | If the assistito’s condition changes, request a *modifica* (increase or decrease of powers) or a *revoca* (if capacity improves). | Guardian + lawyer (if needed). |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common pitfalls & how to avoid them\n\n| Pitfall | Consequence | How to prevent it |\n|---------|-------------|-------------------|\n| **Over‑broad request** (asking for “full management of all assets” when only bill‑paying is needed) | Judge may *limit* the decree, or the process may be delayed. | Start with the *minimum* needed; you can always ask for an amendment later. |\n| **Missing medical report** | The judge will reject the petition or ask for a new assessment", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 127, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 4223}, "latency_s": 20.1900814169785, "request_id": "chatcmpl-127166ec-d32d-4876-a7c4-90b261150b04", "raw_response": null}
