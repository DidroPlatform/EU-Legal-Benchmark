Legal sociology is a descriptive/empirical discipline that observes and analyzes how law functions in society. It does not start with normative prescriptions - that would be contrary to the sociological method. Legal sociologists observe first, then analyze.\n\n**Statement ii**: \"The treasure found on alien property quite likely belonged under Republican Roman law entirely to the landowner.\"\n- This is INCORRECT. Under Republican Roman law, treasure trove (thesaurus) found on another's property was typically split between the finder and the landowner, not given entirely to the landowner. The rule giving all to the landowner came later.\n\n**Statement iii**: \"Carl Stooss advocated that sanctions for committed offences may only be retributive...\"\n- This is INCORRECT. Carl Stooss, the Swiss legal scholar who drafted the Swiss Criminal Code, advocated for a dual-track system (Zweispurigkeit) that included both retributive punishment AND preventive measures/treatment. He did not limit sanctions to only retribution.\n\n**Statement iv**: \"If a party successfully abstractly/directly challenges legislation... If a party, however, successfully concretely/indirectly challenges legislation...\"\n- This is CORRECT. This accurately describes the difference between abstract/direct review (which annuls the law) and concrete/indirect review (which only affects the specific case/decision).\n\n**Statement v**: \"Swiss commercial law could be changed by the Responsible Business Initiative...\"\n- This is CORRECT. The initiative proposed changes to Swiss law regarding corporate liability for foreign subsidiaries' actions.\n\nIncorrect statements: i, ii, and iii\n\n{\"answer\": \"R\", \"reasoning\": \"Statements i, ii, and iii are incorrect. Legal sociology is descriptive not prescriptive, Roman law split treasure trove between finder and landowner, and Carl Stooss advocated for both retributive and preventive sanctions, not only retributive ones.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 562, "completion_tokens": 462, "total_tokens": 1024}, "latency_s": 10.560730833007256, "request_id": "chatcmpl-a92a4713-a4e5-4848-a0bd-53fa0ea56346", "raw_response": null}
