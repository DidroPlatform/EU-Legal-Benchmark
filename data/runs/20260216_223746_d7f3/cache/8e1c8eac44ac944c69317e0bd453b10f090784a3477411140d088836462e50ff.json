The candidate answer extensively analyzes jurisdiction, the scope of the arbitration clause, the threat of German court action, and the strategy for defending against the termination (focusing on pretextual termination and the implied covenant of good faith under Delaware law). It discusses the *defenses* against the German firm's damages claim (causation, mitigation, contractual limitations) but does not explicitly state or analyze the *high burden of proof threshold* that the German distributor faces in *proving* their damages (e.g., lost profits or reputational harm) under Delaware law, which is the specific focus of this criterion. The analysis of damages is focused on the client's counterclaim and defending against the German claim generally, not on the high threshold for proving the German claim itself.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d00808cb-d679-4896-825b-ae9319778964\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4204, "completion_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 4442}, "latency_s": 0.9852180000161752, "request_id": "O8OUaYunG8eqnsEPypadgQU", "raw_response": null}
