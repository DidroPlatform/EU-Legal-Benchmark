The candidate answer mentions that the guardian generally serves without compensation but that the judge can authorize a fair allowance ('equo indennizzo') in appropriate cases. This is a very brief mention and does not fully explain the rules regarding reimbursement of expenses, judicially fixed indemnity, or payment from the estate as required by the criterion's detailed description. It only touches upon the possibility of an allowance, which is insufficient for a high score on this specific criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a7bd8154-0ac2-45ce-b540-bb8bdad7fc89\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2068, "completion_tokens": 168, "total_tokens": 2236}, "latency_s": 0.7942578749789391, "request_id": "fkmUab3BDZ2IxN8Ps4HTyAw", "raw_response": null}
