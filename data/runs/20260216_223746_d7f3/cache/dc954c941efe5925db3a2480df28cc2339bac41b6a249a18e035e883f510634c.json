That's where your real margin lies. An online publisher's pricing is often constrained by market positioning anyway.\n\nWould you like help identifying what to prioritize in contract negotiations?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 80, "completion_tokens": 336, "total_tokens": 416}, "latency_s": 4.413342249987181, "request_id": "chatcmpl-eab5eaae-770d-4abc-bc49-d24593e98627", "raw_response": null}
