The reference answer outlines a structure that requires discussing shareholder wealth maximization versus broader social responsibilities (CSR/Stakeholder model) and mentioning specific legal/theoretical concepts. The candidate successfully covers the core debate: rejecting the Friedman doctrine (shareholder wealth maximization) and arguing for a broader view based on stakeholder interests, legal duties (Art. 717 OR, Art. 716b OR), CSR reporting requirements (Art. 964a ff. OR), and sustainability (ESG). This aligns very well with the required topics (shareholder vs. social institution model, broader responsibilities, legal relevance). The structure is logical, and the arguments are well-supported by referencing specific Swiss legal articles, which serves as a strong contextualization of the general debate mentioned in the reference. It implicitly covers the need to discuss different theories and the purpose of corporate law.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.85}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1898, "completion_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 2134}, "latency_s": 1.7124072079895996, "request_id": "btWUaZn_B4XwnsEP8rzE4QE", "raw_response": null}
