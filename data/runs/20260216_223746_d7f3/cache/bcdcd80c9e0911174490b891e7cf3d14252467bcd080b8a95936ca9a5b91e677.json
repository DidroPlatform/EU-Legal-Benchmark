The case of *R v Keane* [1994] 99 Cr App R 101 deals with the loss of the right to self-defence when the defendant initiates the violence and then claims self-defence against a proportionate response. The facts provided state the client *only* struck the victim *after* the victim first attacked him. The response correctly discusses the general principles of self-defence, including the need for force to be reasonable in the circumstances as the client believed them to be (*Beckford*, *s.76 CJIA 2008*). However, it fails to mention or apply the specific principle derived from *R v Keane* regarding the revival of self-defence after the initial aggressor has ceased their attack and the initial defender retaliates disproportionately. Since the client claims he was the *recipient* of the first attack, the *Keane* principle (which applies when the initial aggressor claims self-defence against a proportionate response) is not directly relevant to the client's *initial* justification, although the concept of excessive force is touched upon via *R v Clegg*. Crucially, the response does not address the specific requirement of the criterion: applying *R v Keane* to a scenario where the client's right to self-defence might be lost due to *his own* subsequent disproportionate retaliation against the victim's initial attack (which is the context where *Keane* is usually cited, even if the facts here suggest the client was responding to the victim's first strike). Since the specific case and its application as described in the criterion are absent, the criterion is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"653cb3de-b54e-4fad-a0f4-e0a95a9f150d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2251, "completion_tokens": 441, "total_tokens": 2692}, "latency_s": 1.3862054999917746, "request_id": "YyWVae6dGeTQnsEPhvGb-Ag", "raw_response": null}
