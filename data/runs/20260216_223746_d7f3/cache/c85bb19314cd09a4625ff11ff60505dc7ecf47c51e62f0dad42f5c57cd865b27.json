The candidate answer explicitly lists several obligations in Section 3 under the 'Rent payment' and 'Proof of compliance with other covenants' categories, and also mentions them in Section 4. Specifically, it mentions: 1. Paying rent on time (core obligation, mentioned multiple times). 2. Complying with the tenancy agreement (general obligation). 3. Proof of compliance with other covenants (which includes not sub-letting, keeping pets, or smoking, which are standard tenant duties). The section on 'Rent payment' directly addresses paying rent on time. The section on 'Proof of compliance with other covenants' covers other typical obligations. The answer clearly identifies more than three obligations.\", \"criterion_id\": \"6488c186-efa8-4d9d-84a7-e426c86d5f92\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4065, "completion_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 4272}, "latency_s": 4.268108832999133, "request_id": "me6UaajsFPfbxN8PuInAkA0", "raw_response": null}
