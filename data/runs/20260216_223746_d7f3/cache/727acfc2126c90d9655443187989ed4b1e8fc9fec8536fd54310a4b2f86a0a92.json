The candidate answer explicitly states the opposite: \\\"a registered mortgage/charge typically takes priority over unregistered beneficial interests... unless: - The bank had actual notice of your interest before advancing the loan, or - The bank is deemed to have constructive notice\\\". This directly contradicts the premise of the criterion, which suggests that registration against a sole proprietor *cannot* overreach the beneficiary's interest (implying the beneficiary's interest *always* takes priority unless specific exceptions apply, or perhaps that the bank's charge is voidable). The candidate answer correctly reflects the general rule in registered land (that a registered charge usually defeats an unregistered interest unless notice exists), but it does not state the absolute proposition required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"56903d4e-63dc-4bc3-85b3-6931cd0ed7b8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2697, "completion_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 2924}, "latency_s": 0.9210342919686809, "request_id": "ivmUabCUFcyynsEPyd_uiAQ", "raw_response": null}
