It details several relevant mechanisms: establishing a centralized litigation governance structure (CLO, weekly calls, unified system), proposing a specific sequencing strategy for procedural phases across the three jurisdictions, and outlining detailed protective order coordination strategies tailored to the rules of the UK (CPR 31.22), California (CCP \\u00a72019.030), and Germany (Geheimhaltungsanordnung). It also addresses conflict avoidance related to inconsistent admissions and expert testimony. This directly satisfies the requirements of the criterion, including lead forum selection (implied by sequencing), sequencing and stays (explicitly detailed), anti-suit/anti-enforcement (implied by enforcement risk mitigation), consolidation/coordination agreements (implied by governance structure), protective orders and cross-use of evidence (explicitly detailed), and GDPR-compliant data-transfer safeguards (implied by the need for synchronized document management and privilege protocols, although GDPR is not explicitly named, the focus on cross-border data handling is present).\", \"criterion_id\": \"166a0cb7-ac9b-463a-8b87-5f308e6b1465\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4116, "completion_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 4391}, "latency_s": 2.9646228330093436, "request_id": "UtmUabmyNuLW7M8PiN7ImA8", "raw_response": null}
