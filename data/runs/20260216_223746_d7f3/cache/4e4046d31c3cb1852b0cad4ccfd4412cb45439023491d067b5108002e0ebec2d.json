The candidate answer analyzes the drunk driver's (D1's) actions as a *novus actus interveniens* breaking the chain from the truck driver (D2), but it focuses entirely on D1's gross intoxication and the *manner* of the swerve (lateral collision into traffic) as the breaking factor. It does not discuss the visibility or conspicuousness of the chair as a factor in assessing the reasonableness of D1's reaction, which is the specific requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d2abf342-9ee3-4014-82e6-c59502d6c44a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1736, "completion_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 1945}, "latency_s": 1.7006165420170873, "request_id": "kjGVaYjKIfjHnsEP9ouZ4Qg", "raw_response": null}
