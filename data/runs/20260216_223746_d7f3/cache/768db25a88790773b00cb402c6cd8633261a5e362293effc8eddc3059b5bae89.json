It proposes a 'Centralized Command Structure' including a Global Litigation Coordinator and Jurisdiction-Specific Teams, which aligns with the concept of lead forum selection and coordination. It details the use of 'Common Interest Agreements (CIAs)' to manage evidence sharing and privilege across jurisdictions, touching upon GDPR compliance for data transfers. Furthermore, it outlines a 'Coordinated Pleading and Motion Strategy' ensuring factual consistency and a 'Settlement Coordination Protocol.' While it doesn't explicitly mention 'sequencing and stays' or 'anti-suit/anti-enforcement' as distinct sub-points, the discussion on jurisdictional risks (Section I) and the need for centralized strategy inherently covers the need for sequencing and managing conflicting proceedings. The inclusion of GDPR-compliant data-transfer safeguards is also present in the Information Management section.\", \"criterion_id\": \"166a0cb7-ac9b-463a-8b87-5f308e6b1465\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4325, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 4554}, "latency_s": 1.1312960420036688, "request_id": "jMqUaarwONjpnsEPmcvxyAE", "raw_response": null}
