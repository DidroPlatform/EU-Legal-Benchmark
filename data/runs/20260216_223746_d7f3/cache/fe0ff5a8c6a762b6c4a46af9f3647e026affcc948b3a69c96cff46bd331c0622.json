Incorrect: In Swiss civil proceedings, parties may propose expert evidence, but the court generally appoints the expert (Art. 183 Swiss Civil Procedure Code). ii. Incorrect: Legal sociology does not follow the same formal logic as legal doctrine; it is empirical and descriptive rather than normative. iii. Correct: The Responsible Business Initiative (RBI) aimed to create liability for Swiss-based multinationals for violations by foreign subsidiaries, though it was rejected in its original form, its indirect counter-proposal was adopted. Thus, this statement is not entirely incorrect, but the phrasing 'could be changed' is ambiguous. iv. Incorrect: Legal sociology generally avoids mixing incompatible theories or conflating 'is' and 'ought' to maintain scientific rigor. v. Incorrect: Swiss law requires reciprocity for recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments and insolvency decrees (Art. 25-27 Swiss Private International Law Act). Thus, i, ii, iv, and v are incorrect.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 390, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 619}, "latency_s": 4.121566957997857, "request_id": "fb449b7ffb6248c18d627a54df7d2c33", "raw_response": null}
