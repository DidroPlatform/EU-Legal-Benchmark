The candidate answer mentions Article 9(5) in the context of Spain's reservation, stating that the refusal to cooperate implicates Article 9(4) and that Article 9(5) requires authorized officers to 'seek information where a breach is suspected.' However, the core action of the Belgian officers was approaching the vessel to 'request information' after observing unmarked lines (a suspected breach). While the candidate mentions Article 9(4) regarding cooperation, it does not explicitly state or confirm that the Belgian officers' initial approach to request information was an action taken in accordance with their duties under Article 9(5). The analysis focuses more on the Spanish refusal (Article 9(4)) and the initial observation (Article 5). The criterion is not clearly and directly satisfied by confirming the Belgian officers' action aligned with Article 9(5).\", \"criterion_id\": \"criterion 5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1510, "completion_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 1729}, "latency_s": 2.4668191660312004, "request_id": "5wKVaa3MMI65kdUPy9PImQM", "raw_response": null}
