The candidate answer explicitly states the opposite: 'The consensus position: Consent to arbitrate a dispute does NOT automatically encompass counterclaims' (which is true, but the next point contradicts the required assertion) and then immediately argues that modern practice leans toward admissibility based on UNCITRAL rules and equality of arms, concluding that 'The counterclaim is likely admissible.' The candidate's overall conclusion and detailed analysis strongly support the *admissibility* of counterclaims under modern practice, directly contradicting the required assertion of *usual inadmissibility* based on silence in the BIT.\", \"criterion_id\": \"191e67ef-7b2a-4b3a-a1e2-fe9e20a8a0b8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2827, "completion_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 3014}, "latency_s": 0.9571192919975147, "request_id": "F9-Uabu5CLT4xs0Pq_qZ4QI", "raw_response": null}
