It does not explicitly present the counter-argument that a reasonable person *would* have seen the chair earlier and acted differently (e.g., planned a careful merge or stopped) as a reason why the swerve *should* break the chain, which is what the criterion demands as part of the analysis of the intervening act.\", \"criterion_id\": \"59f0e49d-855e-44f4-bd5f-6e656891aa30\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1277, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 1477}, "latency_s": 1.3165219590009656, "request_id": "mdGUab7iLYqB7M8P4pHemAI", "raw_response": null}
