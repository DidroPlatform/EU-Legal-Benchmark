The candidate answer discusses the court's power under s.44 AA 1996 to grant relief in support of arbitration, noting that if the arbitration is underway, the court will defer unless there is urgency or the tribunal's powers are insufficient. However, it does not explicitly state the requirement for *permission* from the tribunal/emergency arbitrator/parties when urgency is absent, which is a specific legal threshold often cited in this context (related to the court's power to grant relief when the tribunal is already seized of the matter). The answer focuses more on urgency and the tribunal's ability to act, rather than the explicit requirement for permission/consent when urgency is not present.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f1109ec9-915b-49cf-8602-e1a2f2a99b4b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2815, "completion_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 3050}, "latency_s": 0.8760255000088364, "request_id": "L_qUaaOxEuO9kdUPqsTX2Qg", "raw_response": null}
