The candidate answer provides a general legal analysis and strategy memo covering jurisdiction, forum selection, and general strategy themes (e.g., wrongful termination, breach of confidentiality, unpaid fees). It does not analyze the specific facts of the alleged breach (i.e., whether the client breached an express warranty or concealed vulnerabilities) nor does it limit the potential breaches to only those two possibilities as required by the criterion.
