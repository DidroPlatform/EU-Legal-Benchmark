The specific allegations matter enormously. Without knowing what they're actually claiming, it's difficult to advise on your strongest defences.\n\n**Get professional legal advice specific to your situation as soon as possible.** Housing law is complex, and proper representation significantly improves outcomes.\n\nWould you like guidance on any specific aspect of your case?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 102, "completion_tokens": 779, "total_tokens": 881}, "latency_s": 16.97998100001132, "request_id": "chatcmpl-abbc3550-8722-4139-ba8a-f2495e10a917", "raw_response": null}
