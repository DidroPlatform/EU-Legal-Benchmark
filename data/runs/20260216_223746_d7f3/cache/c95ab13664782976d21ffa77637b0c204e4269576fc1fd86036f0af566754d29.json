The candidate answer discusses Article V defenses (jurisdiction, due process) and the narrow scope of review, but it does not mention Article VII(1) or the specific scenario where an award has been set aside (which would typically trigger Article VII(1) for enforcement in a non-seat state, or Article V(2)(b) for refusal based on public policy, though the prompt implies the award was rendered despite an injunction, not necessarily set aside). Since the specific mention of enforcement authority despite a set-aside under Article VII(1) is absent, the criterion is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"741dc166-2b6b-4fcb-8301-a01449cd57b1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3166, "completion_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 3373}, "latency_s": 0.791500624967739, "request_id": "XRqVaauuLPfonsEPuaungAQ", "raw_response": null}
