Section 76(5A) of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 relates specifically to the householder defence, which applies when force is used in a dwelling. Since the incident occurred during a 'street altercation,' the householder defence is inapplicable. The response implicitly confirms this by focusing entirely on the common law/SDA 2024 framework for non-householder self-defence, and never mentions the 'grossly disproportionate' test associated with s.76(5A). While it doesn't explicitly state 's.76(5A) is not applicable,' its entire analysis correctly omits this test in favour of the general 'reasonable force' test applicable to street altercations, thereby satisfying the requirement that the response recognizes the inapplicability of the householder threshold.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2f43efa2-6cd5-48c6-b8fd-1035de7d7d10\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4305, "completion_tokens": 254, "total_tokens": 4559}, "latency_s": 1.2806073329993524, "request_id": "hNiUaciVC7WVnsEPl_iniQI", "raw_response": null}
