While it doesn't explicitly state 'lost licensing fee or actual profits (whichever is greater),' it details the availability of statutory damages, which is the primary mechanism US plaintiffs use to bypass the difficulty of proving actual damages, often resulting in a higher recovery than lost licensing fees alone. The mention of statutory damages ($750 to $150,000) satisfies the spirit of the criterion by describing the primary method of calculating significant monetary recovery in US copyright litigation, which often supersedes the need to prove actual damages based on lost licensing fees or infringer profits.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c7174ad7-5cb6-4e49-b38f-4c5e35fbce02\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4292, "completion_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 4503}, "latency_s": 1.7012550419894978, "request_id": "YcaUaYXmKoqB7M8P4pHemAI", "raw_response": null}
