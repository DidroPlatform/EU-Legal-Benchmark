{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 0, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires the response to mention the ability for an enforcing body to close the premises if they feel there is a fire safety danger that needs to be addressed. The candidate answer mentions 'Prohibition/Enforcement Notices' under 'Regulatory Outcomes You May Face' and states, 'May prevent use of premises until improvements made,' which is functionally equivalent to the enforcing body having the power to close the premises due to danger. However, the specific phrasing about the enforcing body's power to close the premises due to a fire safety danger is not explicitly stated as required by the criterion, making the fulfillment indirect. Given the strict nature of the rubric, I will mark this as 0 because the exact concept of 'closing the premises' due to 'fire safety danger' is not directly articulated, even though enforcement notices are mentioned.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f3348613-6443-4e4f-adca-916c7cfd0492\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2510, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 2726}, "latency_s": 1.0062874580034986, "request_id": "EM6UacD4LObgnsEP6p2VqQ8", "raw_response": null}
