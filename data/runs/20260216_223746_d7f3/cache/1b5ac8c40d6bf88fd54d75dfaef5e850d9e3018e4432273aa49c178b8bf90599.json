{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 1, \"reasoning\": \"The candidate answer explicitly discusses the enforcement strategy under the New York Convention and, in Section V, introduces the affirmative argument for enforcement by referencing the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) implementation of the Convention, specifically mentioning that the Convention permits parties to invoke more favorable domestic enforcement rules. While it does not quote the text of Article VII directly, it discusses the concept that the Convention provides a 'floor, not a ceiling' for enforcement, which is the core principle derived from Article VII (allowing parties to rely on more favorable domestic law). Furthermore, the structure of the analysis, which focuses on Article V defenses and then moves to affirmative arguments for enforcement, aligns with the strategic use of Article VII's allowance for more favorable domestic rules (like the FAA's mandatory confirmation provision in 9 U.S.C. \\u00a7 207, which is discussed). The reference to Chromalloy Aeroservices v. Arab Republic of Egypt, 939 F. Supp. 907 (D.D.C. 1996) in Section IV, stating that the court enforced an award even though it was set aside, explicitly notes that 'the New York Convention provides a floor, not a ceiling for enforcement,' which is the essence of Article VII.\", \"criterion_id\": \"78fd18d0-9c23-4147-855e-44a9ee3a1b64\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3992, "completion_tokens": 312, "total_tokens": 4304}, "latency_s": 1.3565492909983732, "request_id": "9r2UacKfJJS8nsEPnPGoiQ8", "raw_response": null}
