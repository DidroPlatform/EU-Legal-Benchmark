{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 1, \"reasoning\": \"The response explicitly addresses the need for IP/assignment hygiene under the section 'Tier 1: Non-Negotiable Provisions' within the discussion of the Consent/Veto Catalogue. It states: 'Require your prior written consent for at least: ... Sale or encumbrance of material IP or assets'. Furthermore, the justification section for the consent catalogue mentions IP: '...any change of business purpose...'. While it doesn't use the exact phrase 'IP/assignment hygiene requiring confirmation that all core IP has been properly assigned,' the inclusion of 'Sale or encumbrance of material IP' as a critical veto item directly addresses the need to control the company's core assets, which is the practical implication of ensuring IP hygiene is maintained post-investment. This is a key point related to safeguarding the asset base.\", \"criterion_id\": \"76d9724c-403b-48b3-81ab-0c3a0693efb4\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4128, "completion_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 4345}, "latency_s": 1.05842641700292, "request_id": "l7-UaevINduXkdUPsdSSoAI", "raw_response": null}
