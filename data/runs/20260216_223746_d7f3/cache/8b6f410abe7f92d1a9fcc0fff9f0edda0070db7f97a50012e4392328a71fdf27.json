{"provider": "nim", "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", "text": " **URGENT DISCLAIMER:** Given that (a) there has been a fatality, (b) the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is involved, and (c) you are facing potential corporate manslaughter or gross negligence manslaughter charges, you must immediately instruct specialist criminal defence solicitors with expertise in corporate health and safety law. This response provides general legal framework information only and does not constitute legal advice. Do not make any statements to investigators without legal representation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Legal Framework Applicable to Your Situation\n\n### The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (FSO 2005)\nThis is the primary legislation governing fire safety in non-domestic premises in England. Under **Article 3**, the \"**Responsible Person**\" (RP) is:\n- The employer (if workplace)\n- The person with control of the premises (owner or otherwise)\n- The occupier\n\n**Critical Issue for Shared Buildings:** Article 22 requires where there is more than one RP (you as owner, the neighbour as occupier/lessee), you must **co-operate and co-ordinate** to ensure compliance. The extent of your duty depends on the degree of control retained under the lease terms.\n\n### Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HSWA)\nSection 2 imposes a duty on employers to ensure (so far as is reasonably practicable) the health, safety and welfare of employees. Section 3 imposes duties to non-employees (including visitors and neighbouring workers) affected by work activities.\n\n### Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007\nGiven the fatality, the CPS is likely considering whether your organisation committed corporate manslaughter (gross breach of duty of care by senior management causing death) or whether individuals face gross negligence manslaughter charges.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Demonstrating \"All Reasonable Steps\" (Due Diligence)\n\nTo establish a defence or mitigate sentencing, you would need to demonstrate a **robust safety management system**. However, given the fatality, \"reasonable steps\" becomes a much higher threshold.\n\n### **Advantages in Your Position**\n\n| Factor | Legal Significance |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| **Commissioned Third-Party FRA** | Shows you attempted to identify risks; demonstrates some level of due diligence in seeking expert advice |\n| **Equipment Ownership** | The faulty equipment belonged to the neighbour, not your company |\n| **Lease Arrangement** | If the lease granted exclusive possession of specific areas to the neighbour, their control over their equipment/storage area is stronger |\n| **No Direct PAT Testing Duty** | PAT testing is not strictly mandatory by law (it is a means of compliance, not a legal requirement itself), though checking electrical safety is |\n\n### **Disadvantages/Risks in Your Position**\n\n| Factor | Legal Significance |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| **Building Ownership** | As freeholder, you retain responsibility for structural fire safety, common parts, and ensuring the premises are \"safe\" even if leased out |\n| **Inadequate FRA** | If the FRA failed to identify electrical fire risks in a storage building with portable equipment, it may be deemed not \"suitable and sufficient\" (Article 9). You may face argument that you relied blindly on a third party without checking competence |\n| **Shared Building Management** | If you managed the building (collected service charges, maintained electrics, controlled access), you had ongoing duties to ensure communal safety |\n| **Death Occurred** | The threshold for prosecution is lower regarding what constitutes \"reasonable\" when there is a fatality; courts take a much stricter view |\n| **Electrical Safety** | While PAT testing isn't mandatory, ensuring electrical equipment is safe is. If the building's wiring or socket infrastructure contributed, that's your liability |\n\n### **What You Would Need to Demonstrate**\n\nTo show you took \"all reasonable steps,\" you would need evidence of:\n\n1. **Competence of the Assessor:** Did you check the third-party FRA company was competent (membership of professional bodies, experience with industrial storage)?\n2. **Scope of FRA:** Did you specifically instruct them to assess the shared outbuilding and electrical risks? Was the scope limited inappropriately?\n3. **Co-operation with Neighbour:** Evidence of written agreements or communications about shared fire safety responsibilities, electrical safety protocols, and equipment checking\n4. **Information Provided:** Did you provide the neighbour with your FRA findings? Did you ask for their electrical safety records?\n5. **Building Infrastructure:** Maintenance records for the building's fixed electrical installation (not just portable appliances)\n6. **Emergency Planning:** Fire evacuation procedures for the shared building, coordination of fire drills\n7. **Risk Management:** Whether you prohibited or restricted the use of non-PAT-tested equipment (if you had the contractual right to do so)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Primary Liability: Who is to Blame?\n\n**There is no single \"primary\" blame in law**—liability is several and depends on the specific facts, but here is the likely division:\n\n### **The Neighbouring Company (Strong Primary Liability)**\n- **Their equipment** caused the fire through lack of PAT testing/maintenance\n- As occupier/controller of their leased space, they owed duties to their employees and anyone affected by their work activities (HSWA s.3)\n- They likely breached Article 17 of FSO 2005 (maintenance of equipment) in their demised premises\n- **Risk:** Manslaughter by gross negligence (if senior management knew of PAT testing failures) or corporate manslaughter if their safety systems were inadequate\n\n### **Your Company (Significant Secondary/Contributory Liability)**\n- As owner/landlord, you likely retained duties for **common parts** and **structural fire safety** (Article 8 FSO 2005 - duty to maintain premises)\n- If the electrical infrastructure (sockets, wiring) was your responsibility and contributed, you share blame\n- If you had **management control** over the building (even if leased), you may be seen as having failed to ensure the building was safe overall\n- **Risk:** Corporate manslaughter if senior management decisions (e.g., failing to review the FRA, failing to coordinate safety) were grossly negligent\n\n### **The Third-Party FRA Company**\n- Potentially liable in **civil negligence** (you could claim against them for inadequate report)\n- Not criminally liable under FSO 2005 (they are not the RP), though could face prosecution under HSWA if they were contractors who created risks\n\n### **Individual Liability**\n- Directors or senior managers could face **gross negligence manslaughter** if their personal conduct fell far below expected standards\n- Fire Safety Officer (if employed) could face charges under FSO 2005\n\n---\n\n## 4. Critical Immediate Actions\n\nGiven the CPS involvement:\n\n1. **Preserve Documents:** Immediately secure all fire risk assessments, maintenance records, lease agreements, correspondence with the neighbour, and emails regarding safety. Do not destroy anything (this would be a separate criminal offence).\n2. **Legal Privilege:** Ensure all investigations are conducted under legal professional privilege where possible (instructed by your solicitors).\n3. **Review Lease Terms:** The allocation of responsibilities in your lease with the neighbour is crucial. Does it require them to maintain electrical equipment? Did you retain rights to inspect?\n4. **Insurance:** Notify insurers immediately; check for legal expenses cover for criminal defence.\n5. **No Admissions:** Do not discuss liability with the neighbour or investigators without legal counsel present.\n6. **Internal Investigation:** Conduct an internal review (privileged) to identify if senior management knew or should have known about risks.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nYou would need to demonstrate that as landlord/owner, you discharged your duty by commissioning competent advice, maintaining the building structure, and attempting to co-ordinate safety with your tenant. However, **as the building owner where a death occurred, you face serious criminal exposure** if the investigation reveals that your fire risk assessment was inadequate or that you failed to exercise sufficient control over hazardous activities in your building.\n\n**Primary blame likely lies with the neighbouring company** for bringing in and using untested equipment, but in a shared premises fatality, the CPS typically casts a wide net. The absence of PAT testing mention in your FRA is a significant vulnerability—it suggests either the FRA was incompetent (for which you chose them) or that electrical risks were not properly considered in a storage environment.\n\n**You must treat this as a potential corporate manslaughter investigation.**", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 270, "completion_tokens": 2597, "total_tokens": 2867}, "latency_s": 97.26324149998254, "request_id": "chatcmpl-a898d3273d95bd60", "raw_response": null}
