'The capacity of judgment is not determined abstractly, but in light of each legal transaction or event taking place.' - This is CORRECT. Under Swiss law (Art. 16 CC), capacity of judgment (Urteilsfähigkeit) is assessed concretely in relation to each specific act, not abstractly.\\n\\nii. 'Judgments given in Swiss civil proceedings become res judicata not only between the parties but against any person who has an interest in the matter.' - This is INCORRECT. Under Swiss law, res judicata (materielle Rechtskraft) generally only binds the parties to the proceedings (inter partes effect), not third parties. There are limited exceptions, but the general rule is that judgments only have effect between the parties.\\n\\niii. 'It is a Swiss particularity that all major political parties are represented in the Federal Council. To this effect, the so-called magic formula was established (by practice, not based on an explicit provision in the Constitution).' - This is CORRECT. The magic formula (Zauberformel) is indeed a practice/convention, not constitutionally mandated.\\n\\niv. 'The values \\\"power\\\" and \\\"not power\\\" constitute the political system's code according to Niklas Luhmann.' - This is CORRECT. Luhmann identified the binary code of the political system as government/opposition or power/not-power (Macht/Nicht-Macht).\\n\\nv. 'Spouses are subject to the provisions governing separation of property, provided they have not agreed otherwise in a marital agreement and provided no extraordinary marital property regime has come into effect.' - This is INCORRECT. Under Swiss law (Art. 181 CC), the default matrimonial property regime is participation in acquired property (Errungenschaftsbeteiligung), not separation of property (Gütertrennung). Separation of property must be specifically agreed upon or ordered.\\n\\nSo statements ii and v are incorrect.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 569, "completion_tokens": 464, "total_tokens": 1033}, "latency_s": 7.857223874976626, "request_id": "chatcmpl-b54d153e-4dbc-4f7e-94f7-c4ae44961e15", "raw_response": null}
