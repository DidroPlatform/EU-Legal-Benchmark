The prompt clearly frames the issue as a dispute over false performance allegations leading to reputational damage, which is the core of a defamation claim, not a contract breach/wrongful dismissal claim. The candidate answer correctly analyzes the situation as a choice between accepting a settlement without a retraction versus suing for defamation, focusing entirely on reputational repair, discovery risks in litigation, and the nature of defamation trials. It does not confuse the two legal concepts.\", \"criterion_id\": \"42de87ff-5a4d-4099-838d-b29471e4f2a8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2917, "completion_tokens": 161, "total_tokens": 3078}, "latency_s": 0.672335707989987, "request_id": "MBmVafy1GJuZ28oPh4-usAQ", "raw_response": null}
