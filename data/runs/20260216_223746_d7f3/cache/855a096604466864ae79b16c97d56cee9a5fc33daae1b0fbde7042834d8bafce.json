While it mentions a potential split of 60% to Ireland and 40% to the UK in an example, it does not explicitly define the UK entity's role as funding 30-40% *within the context of a CSA* as the primary description of its contribution, instead focusing on a routine return model which is distinct from the specific funding percentage mentioned in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f7ea179f-3f02-4f0a-adb4-f3c468557271\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2537, "completion_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 2757}, "latency_s": 1.0274109999882057, "request_id": "XP2UaYiEBfDm7M8PqbvO6QU", "raw_response": null}
