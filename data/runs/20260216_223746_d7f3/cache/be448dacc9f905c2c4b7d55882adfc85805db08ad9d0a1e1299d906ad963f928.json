While the criterion specifically mentions the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP sections 2016-2036), the reference to FRCP 26 and 34, which govern discovery in U.S. federal courts (and are highly influential/mirrored in California state practice, especially concerning broad discovery scope), sufficiently addresses the core concept of broad discovery associated with California litigation in this comparative context. The candidate correctly identifies the key procedural difference (broad discovery) associated with the U.S./California jurisdiction.\", \"criterion_id\": \"7ab189fa-1225-4153-930e-3dd8f1e26685\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4429, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 4645}, "latency_s": 1.4030590830370784, "request_id": "zveUacKPA6rw7M8P4OXQkQk", "raw_response": null}
