The candidate answer focuses almost entirely on the *personnel regime* (private vs. public law employment contracts) being determined by the constitutive convention, which is related but distinct from the GIP's overall legal governance regime. While the text mentions GIPs are 'legal persons under public law' (which is true), it does not explicitly state the condition under which the GIP *itself* might be governed by public law due to its purpose or convention, as opposed to the personnel regime choice. The answer addresses the personnel choice, not the GIP's overarching legal status determination based on purpose/convention.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4497b5d2-6bd3-4985-9d36-5802ba306a90\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1383, "completion_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 1587}, "latency_s": 1.8479730830003973, "request_id": "B0eUaaWDA8qXvdIPnJKywQM", "raw_response": null}
