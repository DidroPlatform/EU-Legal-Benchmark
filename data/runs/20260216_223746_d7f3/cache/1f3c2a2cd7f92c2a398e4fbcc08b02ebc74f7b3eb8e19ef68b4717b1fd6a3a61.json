The good news is that your position is significantly stronger than you might think. Let me walk through this systematically.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Do You Even Have Copyright Protection?\n\n**Yes, absolutely.** This is the most important thing to understand first.\n\nUnder the **Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA 1988)**, copyright protection in the UK is **automatic upon creation**. There is **no registration requirement whatsoever**.\n\n- **Section 1(1)(a) CDPA 1988** protects \"original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works\"\n- Your graphic novel qualifies as both a **literary work** (the narrative/text) and an **artistic work** (the illustrations) under **s.4(1)(a)**\n- The character designs, panel layouts, dialogue, and overall visual storytelling are all independently protectable elements\n- Copyright arose the **moment you created** 'Nexus', not when you uploaded it\n\n**Posting online does not waive your rights.** Publication on the internet does not place work into the public domain or create an implied licence for commercial AI training. You simply made it accessible, which is entirely different from granting permission to reproduce or adapt it.\n\nThe UK is a signatory to the **Berne Convention**, which mandates that copyright protection must exist **without formalities**. So the fact you didn't register anything is completely irrelevant to whether you hold rights.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The AI Training Scraping: Is This Infringement?\n\nThis is where things get legally complex, but the weight of the argument favours you.\n\n### What Synthetic Dreams Corp Actually Did\n\nWhen they scraped your 40 pages and ingested them into their training pipeline, they almost certainly made **copies** of your work. Training an AI model typically involves:\n\n- **Downloading/storing** the work (reproduction)\n- **Processing and encoding** the work into the model's parameters (arguably a further reproduction or adaptation)\n\n### The Key Legal Provisions\n\n**Section 17 CDPA 1988** gives you the exclusive right to **copy** your work. Copying is defined broadly and includes reproducing the work \"in any material form,\" which includes **storing it by electronic means** under **s.17(6)**.\n\n**Section 21** gives you the exclusive right to make an **adaptation** of a literary work.\n\nAny party doing either of these things without your licence is **prima facie infringing** your copyright.\n\n### The Critical Exception: Text and Data Mining (TDM)\n\nNow, here is where Synthetic Dreams Corp would likely try to mount a defence. The UK does have a TDM exception, but it is **extremely narrow**.\n\n**Section 29A CDPA 1988** permits text and data mining, but **only for non-commercial research purposes**. The requirements are strict:\n\n- The person must have **lawful access** to the work\n- The mining must be carried out for the sole purpose of **non-commercial research**\n- There must be **sufficient acknowledgement** (unless impractical)\n\nSynthetic Dreams Corp is a **commercial entity** training a **commercial model** that generates **licensed outputs for paying users**. This is about as far from non-commercial research as you can get. **Section 29A almost certainly does not apply to them.**\n\nThis is a crucial distinction. Unlike some other jurisdictions that have been debating broader TDM exceptions, the UK's current law is quite protective of creators in this specific scenario. The UK Government did consider introducing a broader TDM exception that would have covered commercial use, but this proposal was **shelved in 2023** following significant pushback from the creative industries. As of now, the narrow non-commercial limitation remains the law.\n\nTherefore, the scraping and training likely constitutes **unauthorised reproduction** under s.17, without a valid defence.\n\n### Jurisdictional Consideration\n\nYou might wonder whether UK law even applies since Synthetic Dreams Corp is American. There are a few points here:\n\n- Your copyright exists under UK law and is recognised internationally through the **Berne Convention** (to which the US is also a signatory)\n- If their scraping accessed servers or targeted UK-published content, there are arguments for UK jurisdiction\n- You could potentially also bring claims under **US copyright law**, where the fair use analysis for commercial AI training is actively being litigated (with cases like **Thomson Reuters v. Ross Intelligence** and the **New York Times v. OpenAI** litigation being highly relevant)\n- However, pursuing a US claim would be more complex and expensive, so a UK-based action may be more practical depending on the circumstances\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Fizzy Drink Advert: Character Appropriation\n\nThis is arguably the **most clear-cut infringement** in your entire situation.\n\n### Copyright in Characters\n\nUK law can protect fictional characters where they have **sufficiently distinctive visual expression**. Your character \"Ophelia\" as depicted in your graphic novel, with her specific visual design, costume, features, and artistic style, is protected as an artistic work under **s.4 CDPA 1988**.\n\nThe leading principle comes from case law establishing that a **substantial part** of a work can be infringed even if the entire work is not copied verbatim. Under **s.16(3)(a) CDPA 1988**, infringement occurs when someone copies **the whole or a substantial part** of a protected work.\n\n\"Substantial\" is assessed **qualitatively, not just quantitatively**. If Ophelia is recognisably derived from your original design, even a \"slightly altered\" version likely reproduces the **essential, distinctive features** that make the character yours.\n\nThe case of **Designers Guild Ltd v Russell Williams (Textiles) Ltd [2000] UKHL 58** (House of Lords) confirmed that what matters is whether the defendant has taken the **skill, labour, and creative expression** of the original author, and that altered copying is still copying.\n\n### Who Is Liable?\n\nThis is important because there are potentially **multiple infringers** in the chain:\n\n1. **Synthetic Dreams Corp** - for scraping and training on your work, and for providing a tool that outputs infringing material derived from your creative expression\n2. **The user who generated the image** - for creating an infringing reproduction/adaptation of your character using the AI tool\n3. **The fizzy drink company** - for commissioning, publishing, and commercially exploiting the infringing image in a national advertising campaign\n\nUnder **s.23 CDPA 1988**, a person who **possesses, distributes, or deals with** an infringing copy in the course of business is also liable for **secondary infringement**, provided they knew or had reason to believe the article was an infringing copy.\n\nThe advertising agency and the drink brand would have a difficult time arguing they had no reason to investigate the provenance of the artwork they used in a national campaign.\n\n### The Credit Issue\n\nThe fact that the advert credited the AI user rather than you is not just insulting; it is legally relevant. Under **Chapter IV of the CDPA 1988**, you possess **moral rights**, which exist independently of your economic copyright:\n\n- **Section 77**: The right to be **identified as the author** (the \"paternity right\") of your work when it is published commercially, exhibited, or included in a film or broadcast. However, I must be honest here: this right must be **asserted** under **s.78**, typically by a statement in writing. If you haven't formally asserted this right (for example, in a notice on your published work), enforcing it becomes more difficult, though not impossible depending on the circumstances.\n- **Section 80**: The right to object to **derogatory treatment** of your work. \"Treatment\" includes any addition, deletion, alteration, or adaptation. If the altered version of Ophelia distorts or mutilates your work, or is prejudicial to your honour or reputation (for instance, being used to sell a product without your consent in a way that misrepresents your association), this right is engaged. Crucially, the **s.80 right does not need to be asserted** to be enforceable.\n- **Section 84**: The right not to have a work **falsely attributed** to you. While the advert credited the user rather than you, if anyone is led to believe the character originated from someone other than you, there may be an argument here too.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Could They Argue Any Defence?\n\nLet me anticipate the defences they might raise and assess their strength:\n\n### \"Fair Dealing\" (UK equivalent of fair use)\n\nThe UK does not have a broad, open-ended \"fair use\" doctrine like the US. Instead, the CDPA provides **closed, specific exceptions** (fair dealing for research/private study under s.29, criticism/review under s.30, parody under s.30A, news reporting under s.30(2), etc.).\n\n- **Commercial AI training** does not fit within any of these categories\n- A **national advertising campaign** is about as far from fair dealing as imaginable\n- None of the recognised fair dealing purposes apply to what has happened to your work\n\n### \"The output is transformative\"\n\nThis is a US-style argument that has **no direct equivalent in UK law**. UK copyright law does not have a \"transformative use\" doctrine. The question is simply whether a substantial part of your original expression has been reproduced, and if the character is recognisably Ophelia, the answer is likely yes.\n\n### \"You made it publicly available\"\n\nMaking a work publicly available is not a licence. **Publication does not equal permission.** Under the Berne Convention and UK law, the default position is that all rights are reserved unless explicitly granted.\n\n### \"AI-generated output is not a copy\"\n\nThis is a genuinely novel legal argument and one that courts have not yet fully resolved. However, where the output is **recognisably derived** from specific training data (as appears to be the case with a \"slightly altered\" version of your specific character), the argument that no copying occurred becomes very difficult to sustain. The causal chain from your original work to the infringing output is clear.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Steps You Should Take\n\nGiven the strength of your position, here is what I would recommend:\n\n1. **Document everything immediately.** Screenshot the advert, archive the AI-generated image, record the credit given to the user, save any evidence that your work was in their training data. Use the Wayback Machine or similar tools to timestamp your original uploads.\n\n2. **Formally assert your moral rights.** Put a clear statement on all your published work going forward (e.g., \"The right of [your name] to be identified as the author of this work has been asserted in accordance with sections 77 and 78 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988\"). Do this now for future protection.\n\n3. **Seek specialist legal advice.** Look for an intellectual property solicitor, ideally one with experience in digital/creative industries. Many IP firms offer initial consultations at reduced cost or pro bono for individual creators. Organisations like **Own-It** (if still operating), the **Creators' Rights Alliance**, or the **UK Copyright Service** may be able to point you in the right direction. The **Intellectual Property Enterprise Court (IPEC)** in London is specifically designed to handle IP disputes for smaller claimants with a **costs cap** (currently £50,000), making litigation more accessible for individual creators like you.\n\n4. **Consider sending a formal cease-and-desist letter** (through a solicitor) to Synthetic Dreams Corp, the AI user, and the fizzy drink company demanding removal of the advert and compensation.\n\n5. **Contact your professional community.** Organisations like the **Association of Illustrators (AOI)** or the **Society of Authors** may offer legal support, model contracts, or collective action resources. This is an issue affecting many creators right now, and there is strength in numbers.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n| Issue | Your Position |\n|---|---|\n| Copyright exists without registration | **Yes, fully protected automatically** |\n| AI scraping for commercial training | **Likely infringement, no valid UK exception** |\n| Character reproduction in advert | **Strong case for infringement** |\n| Moral rights (credit/integrity) | **Engaged, especially s.80 (derogatory treatment)** |\n| Available defences for them | **Weak under UK law** |\n| Practical enforceability | **Realistic, especially through IPEC** |\n\n---\n\n**The bottom line:** You have not screwed yourself. UK law is actually relatively protective in this scenario compared to some other jurisdictions. You have real, enforceable rights, and the facts as you describe them suggest multiple infringements by multiple parties. The absence of registration is irrelevant under UK law.\n\nThat said, I want to be transparent: **AI and copyright is a rapidly evolving area of law**, and some of these questions (particularly around the precise legal characterisation of AI training) have not yet been definitively ruled on by UK courts. The legal principles I have outlined are well-established, but their specific application to AI training is still being tested. This makes early legal advice all the more important.\n\nYou created something original. The law recognises that. Please do not let the complexity of the situation discourage you from pursuing this.\n\n---\n\n*This analysis is for informational purposes and does not constitute formal legal advice.
