Stone & Rolls Ltd*). The task instructions imply a common law context based on the company's UK incorporation and the nature of the defense being discussed in the reference answer. The candidate's analysis of *ex turpi causa* under Swiss law (Art. 20 Abs. 2 OR, ZGB, SchKG) is irrelevant to the expected legal framework derived from the reference material. Furthermore, the reference answer correctly identifies the core issue: the presence of innocent shareholders/creditors (represented by the liquidator) defeats the *ex turpi causa* defense, even if the company's organ committed the wrong. The candidate's conclusion is correct, but the entire legal foundation is wrong for this context, leading to a very low score.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.25}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1985, "completion_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 2213}, "latency_s": 21.431696791027207, "request_id": "LTaVaaPpCZHw7M8Pi4iBgAU", "raw_response": null}
