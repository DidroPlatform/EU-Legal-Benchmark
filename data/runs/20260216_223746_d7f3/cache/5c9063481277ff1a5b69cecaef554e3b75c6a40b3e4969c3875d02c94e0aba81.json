The candidate answer discusses Section 44(2A) and (5) of the Arbitration Act 1996, stating relief is available if it is 'urgent, the tribunal cannot be approached promptly, or other exceptional circumstances apply.' It also mentions that 'Permission from the tribunal is often sought first as a matter of comity, but not always required.' This does not accurately reflect the statutory requirement under s44(3) of the Arbitration Act 1996, which states that the court shall not exercise its power under s44(2) unless it is satisfied that the applicant cannot obtain the relief sought from the tribunal or the emergency arbitrator. The candidate answer focuses on the exceptions (urgency) rather than the general rule requiring permission/satisfaction that the tribunal cannot act, which is the core of the criterion's requirement regarding permission/satisfaction when urgency is absent.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f1109ec9-915b-49cf-8602-e1a2f2a99b4b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1730, "completion_tokens": 282, "total_tokens": 2012}, "latency_s": 0.9237359170219861, "request_id": "UCiVadG_Oo65kdUPytPImQM", "raw_response": null}
