However, it does not explicitly state that the *owner* (the client) retains responsibility *if the report has been incorrectly completed* by the third party, which is the specific nuance required by the criterion. It states the RP's duty remains, which is close but not an exact match to the required phrasing regarding the owner's responsibility for the third party's error.\", \"criterion_id\": \"96af97b1-4044-42bb-9b71-15102a04a27e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3184, "completion_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 3411}, "latency_s": 0.9498502499773167, "request_id": "JRuVaca0MfujkdUP0fjD0QU", "raw_response": null}
