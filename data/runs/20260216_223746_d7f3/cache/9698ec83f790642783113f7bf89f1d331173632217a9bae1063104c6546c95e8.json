More importantly, the response details the Green Lane mechanism: 'Minimal checks (only identity checks, no full customs or SPS controls)' which is the practical outcome for trusted traders using that lane. The criterion is satisfied by explaining the Green Lane presumption which is predicated on the trader status.\", \"criterion_id\": \"de1dc6bb-2579-4bd3-9240-c5438b7ebf44\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2970, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 3180}, "latency_s": 1.27564866701141, "request_id": "kgGVaffrK-O9kdUPqsTX2Qg", "raw_response": null}
