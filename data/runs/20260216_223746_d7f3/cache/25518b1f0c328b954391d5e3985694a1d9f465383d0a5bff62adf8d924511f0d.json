The candidate answer discusses the admissibility of counterclaims, focusing heavily on jurisdictional consent, connection, and applicable law, and cites cases where environmental counterclaims were raised (*Perenco*, *Urbaser*). However, it never explicitly defines or discusses the *concept* of the host-state's regulatory space or sovereign margin for legitimate regulation, which is a distinct legal concept often invoked when assessing the merits or scope of a state's regulatory actions, rather than just the tribunal's jurisdiction over a counterclaim based on those actions.
