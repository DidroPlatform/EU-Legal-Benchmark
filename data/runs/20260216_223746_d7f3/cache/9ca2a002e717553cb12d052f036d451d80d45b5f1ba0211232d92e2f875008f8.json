Section 3.2, under the 'Likely allocation of blame' table, explicitly discusses how blame is shared based on control and contractual obligations. The text states: 'If you had a contractual right to control equipment in the shared space and failed to enforce it, you may be deemed to have allowed a breach of the EAWR.' Furthermore, the conclusion states: 'Secondary (or joint) liability will rest on your company as the Responsible Person... because you owned the building, you had the statutory duty to ensure that all hazards in the out-building were identified and controlled, and you did not have a robust mechanism... to prevent unauthorised, un-tested equipment from being used.' This directly addresses the concept of shared/joint liability arising from shared control and failure to cooperate/enforce safety obligations.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e230acad-079d-4755-a895-6b8e56fa4390\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4334, "completion_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 4579}, "latency_s": 0.8653940000222065, "request_id": "3uuUaemEOtfu7M8Pk_6wkAU", "raw_response": null}
