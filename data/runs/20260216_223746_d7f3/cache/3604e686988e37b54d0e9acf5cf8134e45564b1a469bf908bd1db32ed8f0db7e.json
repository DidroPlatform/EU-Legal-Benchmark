PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe question requires analysis under **English law** (not Swiss law), as Digital Assets Ltd is a UK-based company and the relevant legal relationships are governed by UK company and tort law. The ex turpi causa non oritur actio defense is a common law doctrine.\n\n**Key factual elements requiring clarification:**\n- The precise nature and extent of P&L Audit Ltd's negligence in the audit\n- Whether P&L Audit Ltd was complicit in or aware of Achille Taloon's willful overstatement\n- The specific losses claimed by the liquidator\n\n## II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\n### A. The Ex Turpi Causa Defense\n\nThe ex turpi causa non oritur actio defense prevents a claimant from recovering damages where the claim is founded on the claimant's own illegal or immoral conduct. The principle is that \"no court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act.\"\n\n### B. Application in Auditor Negligence Cases\n\nThe leading authority is **Stone & Rolls Ltd (in liquidation) v Moore Stephens** [2009] UKHL 39, where the House of Lords considered whether an auditor could rely on ex turpi causa when sued by a company in liquidation for failing to detect fraudulent conduct by the company's controlling director.\n\n## III. ANALYSIS\n\n### A. Attribution of Achille Taloon's Conduct to Digital Assets Ltd\n\n**The central issue** is whether Achille Taloon's fraudulent conduct should be attributed to Digital Assets Ltd for purposes of the ex turpi causa defense.\n\n**In Stone & Rolls**, the majority held that:\n1. Where a company's sole directing mind commits fraud, that fraud is attributed to the company itself\n2. The company cannot then sue its auditors for failing to detect that very fraud\n3. The ex turpi causa defense succeeds because the claim is founded on the company's own illegality\n\n**However, the \"sole actor\" doctrine has limitations:**\n\nIn **Bilta (UK) Ltd (in liquidation) v Nazir** [2015] UKSC 23, the Supreme Court clarified that attribution depends on the context and purpose of the rule being applied. Where a liquidator sues on behalf of creditors and innocent shareholders, the fraudulent director's conduct may not be attributed to the company.\n\n### B. Application to Present Facts\n\n**Factors supporting P&L Audit Ltd's ex turpi causa defense:**\n\n1. **Sole director**: Achille Taloon was the sole member of the board of directors, making him the company's directing mind and will\n2. **Willful misconduct**: The overstatement was willful, not merely negligent\n3. **Company's claim**: The claim is brought by the company (in liquidation) for breach of duty of care\n\n**Factors against the defense:**\n\n1. **Innocent shareholders**: Eden Sharehan (21% shareholder) was innocent and misled by the fraudulent accounts\n2. **Creditors' interests**: The liquidator sues for the benefit of creditors who are victims of the fraud\n3. **Bilta principle**: Attribution should not defeat claims where the company is the victim, not the perpetrator\n\n### C. The \"Victim Exception\"\n\nPost-Bilta, courts recognize that where:\n- The company is the victim of the director's fraud (not merely the vehicle)\n- The liquidator sues for the benefit of innocent stakeholders\n- The wrongdoing director has departed from his duty to the company\n\nThe fraudulent conduct should **not** be attributed to the company for ex turpi causa purposes.\n\n### D. Auditor's Duty and the Nature of the Claim\n\nP&L Audit Ltd owed a duty to:\n1. Conduct the audit with reasonable skill and care\n2. Report whether accounts show a true and fair view\n3. Protect the company and its stakeholders from reliance on false accounts\n\n**The claim is not founded on illegality** but on P&L Audit Ltd's failure to detect and report the overstatement. The company (through innocent stakeholders) is the victim of both:\n- Achille Taloon's fraud, and\n- P&L Audit Ltd's alleged negligence\n\n## IV. CONCLUSION\n\n**P&L Audit Ltd will likely NOT succeed** in defeating the liquidator's claim through the ex turpi causa defense, for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Post-Bilta jurisprudence**: The Supreme Court has narrowed the scope of attribution in liquidation contexts where innocent stakeholders are affected\n\n2. **Victim status**: Digital Assets Ltd (and its innocent shareholders and creditors) are victims of the fraud, not perpetrators. The liquidator's claim seeks to recover losses caused by P&L Audit Ltd's failure to protect these innocent parties\n\n3. **Policy considerations**: Allowing the defense would:\n   - Permit auditors to escape liability for negligent audits whenever a fraudulent director is involved\n   - Undermine the protective function of statutory audits\n   - Prejudice innocent shareholders and creditors\n\n4. **Distinction from Stone & Rolls**: Unlike Stone & Rolls (where the company was essentially a vehicle for one-man fraud with no innocent stakeholders), Digital Assets Ltd had a substantial minority shareholder (21%) and creditors who were victims\n\n**However**, if P&L Audit Ltd can demonstrate that it was not negligent (i.e., that the fraud was undetectable through a properly conducted audit), this would provide a complete defense on the merits, rendering the ex turpi causa argument unnecessary.\n\nThe liquidator's claim should therefore proceed to examination of whether P&L Audit Ltd breached its duty of care in conducting the audit.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 419, "completion_tokens": 1305, "total_tokens": 1724}, "latency_s": 22.412179667007877, "request_id": "chatcmpl-ad6077aa-a94e-4400-bc24-255321a997f8", "raw_response": null}
