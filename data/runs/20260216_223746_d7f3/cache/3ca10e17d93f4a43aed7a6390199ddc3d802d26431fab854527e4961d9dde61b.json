No registration is required - protection is automatic upon creation.\n\n### Analysis of Each Shirt\n\n**1. Character with different outfit and sunglasses:**\n- **Likely infringement** - reproduces the recognizable character\n- The outfit change is a derivative work without authorization\n- **Article 18** of Italian Copyright Law protects against unauthorized reproduction and adaptation\n\n**2. Worker's rights advocate version:**\n- **Potentially infringement, but parody defense possible**\n- EU law recognizes parody as an exception (Case C-201/13, *Deckmyn*)\n- Must meet parody criteria: convey humor/mockery, be recognizable but distinguishable, not create confusion about source\n- Political commentary may strengthen parody defense\n\n**3. Warped version mocking the show's joke:**\n- **Strongest parody defense**\n- Directly comments on the original work\n- Likely protected if transformative and doesn't substitute for original merchandise\n\n### Remedies Available in Italy\n\n**Civil Actions:**\n- **Injunctions** (immediate and permanent)\n- **Damages** (actual damages or statutory)\n- **Seizure and destruction** of infringing goods\n- **Publication of judgment** at infringer's expense\n\n**Criminal Actions:**\n- Italy has criminal copyright provisions\n- Penalties include fines and potential imprisonment\n- Useful for deterrence with commercial counterfeiters\n\n### Practical Steps\n\n1. **Document everything** - photographs, vendor locations, dates\n2. **Cease and desist letters** through Italian counsel\n3. **Contact Italian customs** (Agenzia delle Dogane) for border seizures\n4. **File with local police** (Guardia di Finanza handles IP crimes)\n5. **Consider expedited proceedings** for injunctions\n\n---\n\n## UNITED STATES - Copyright Analysis\n\n### Legal Framework\n- **Copyright Act of 1976** (17 U.S.C.)\n- Protection for \"pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works\"\n- Character copyright protection well-established\n\n### Analysis of Each Shirt\n\n**1. Different outfit with sunglasses:**\n- **Clear infringement** under 17 U.S.C. § 106\n- Violates reproduction and derivative work rights\n- Outfit change doesn't avoid infringement if character is recognizable\n- *Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates* (9th Cir. 1978) - character copying is infringement even with alterations\n\n**2. Worker's rights advocate version:**\n- **Infringement, but fair use defense available**\n- Four-factor fair use analysis (17 U.S.C. § 107):\n  - **Purpose**: Transformative political commentary favors fair use\n  - **Nature**: Creative works get more protection (against fair use)\n  - **Amount**: Entire character used (against fair use)\n  - **Market effect**: Competes with legitimate merchandise (against fair use)\n- Likely **NOT fair use** - commercial sale on merchandise typically fails (*Rogers v. Koons*)\n- Compare: *Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin* (parody book allowed) vs. *Dr. Seuss Enterprises v. ComicMix* (commercial parody book rejected)\n\n**3. Warped version mocking the joke:**\n- **Best fair use argument, but still problematic**\n- More transformative (comments on the work itself)\n- But commercial merchandise use weighs heavily against fair use\n- *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose* (2 Live Crew) allowed parody, but that was a new creative work, not merchandise\n- Merchandise context: *Kienitz v. Sconnie Nation* suggests some transformative uses on t-shirts can be fair use, but it's fact-specific\n\n### Key Difference from Italy\nUS fair use is more flexible but **very fact-intensive**. Parody must be transformative AND non-commercial use weighs heavily. Selling t-shirts is commercial, making fair use much harder to establish than in other contexts.\n\n### Remedies in the US\n\n**Civil Remedies (17 U.S.C. § 504-505):**\n- **Injunctive relief**\n- **Actual damages + profits**, OR\n- **Statutory damages** ($750-$30,000 per work; up to $150,000 if willful)\n- **Attorney's fees** (if registered before infringement)\n- **Impoundment and destruction**\n\n**Criminal Provisions (rare for t-shirts):**\n- Requires willful infringement for commercial advantage\n- Usually reserved for large-scale operations\n\n### Practical Steps in US\n\n1. **Ensure copyright registration** - required to sue, enables statutory damages\n2. **Send DMCA takedown notices** if sold online\n3. **Cease and desist letters**\n4. **Federal court litigation** (exclusive jurisdiction)\n5. **Customs recordation** with CBP for imports\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n**Italy:**\n- Stronger on straightforward infringement\n- Parody defense exists but narrower than US fair use\n- Criminal enforcement more accessible\n- EU-wide enforcement possible\n\n**United States:**\n- Fair use more flexible but unpredictable\n- Commercial merchandise use heavily disfavored\n- Registration critical for full remedies\n- Statutory damages can be powerful deterrent\n\n**Recommendation:** The first shirt (different outfit) is clearly actionable in both jurisdictions. The political and parody shirts are more complex - likely still infringement in both, but defendants would have stronger defenses, particularly in the US. Priority should be stopping the clear infringement first.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on enforcement strategy in either jurisdiction?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 166, "completion_tokens": 1398, "total_tokens": 1564}, "latency_s": 25.95878287497908, "request_id": "chatcmpl-906cb534-d419-43b4-b67b-53ff97d74b34", "raw_response": null}
