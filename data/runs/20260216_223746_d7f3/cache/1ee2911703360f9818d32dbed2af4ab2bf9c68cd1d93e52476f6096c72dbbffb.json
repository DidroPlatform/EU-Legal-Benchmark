The candidate answer consistently uses the term 'admissible' and 'jurisdiction' interchangeably when discussing the requirements for accepting a counterclaim (Consent, Connection, Applicable Law). For instance, it states, 'a host\\u2010state \\u201ccounter\\u2010claim\\u201d is admissible only when the treaty... gives the state consent to be sued...' and later frames the three steps as a 'jurisdictional test.' While the analysis covers the substantive jurisdictional hurdles (consent, connection), it fails to explicitly address the conceptual distinction between procedural admissibility (e.g., under UNCITRAL Art. 23(1) which requires the claim to 'arise out of the same transaction or occurrence') and substantive jurisdiction (ratione materiae, based on consent in the BIT). The response does not articulate that a claim could pass the procedural 'connection' test but still fail for lack of substantive consent (jurisdiction ratione materiae), or vice versa, which is the core requirement of this criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5bd9c5b8-913d-4e37-8ca4-67a98f63820c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3278, "completion_tokens": 293, "total_tokens": 3571}, "latency_s": 1.3189282080275007, "request_id": "FO6UaZbmF9WbkdUPueCoyAM", "raw_response": null}
