The candidate answer discusses the drunk driver's conduct as a potential *novus actus interveniens* breaking the chain for the truck driver. It notes that the defence could argue the drunk driver's act was independent and overwhelming because he swerved into an adjacent car, implying an unreasonable manoeuvre. However, it does not explicitly articulate the specific counter-argument required by the criterion: that a reasonable person would have seen the chair in advance and planned a careful merge or stopped. It discusses the general foreseeability of evasive action but stops short of detailing the specific 'reasonable person' planning argument mentioned in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"59f0e49d-855e-44f4-bd5f-6e656891aa30\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1809, "completion_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 2039}, "latency_s": 0.8203890000004321, "request_id": "fB6VaaemLY65kdUPy9PImQM", "raw_response": null}
