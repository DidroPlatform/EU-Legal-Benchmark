While the answer does not explicitly mention 'percentages based on the amount of fault designated by the jury' (which is more common in civil/tort law than criminal law where causation is generally established or broken), the core concept of shared liability/concurrent causation between the two parties is clearly established, satisfying the intent of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"dda864ac-b922-4cbc-89f6-414a89bd03ed\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2701, "completion_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 2921}, "latency_s": 1.0449938329984434, "request_id": "pcKUaYqKHpeBkdUP9--_-AI", "raw_response": null}
