The candidate answer discusses the intoxication only in the context of making the drunk driver's act *less* voluntary and concludes that the chain of causation was *not* broken. It mentions the truck driver *might* argue the extreme intoxication was unforeseeable, but it does not explicitly state that the intoxication level itself serves as evidence for the defense to argue the intervening act was unreasonable/breaking the chain, as required by the criterion. The analysis focuses on why the intoxication likely *fails* to break the chain, rather than acknowledging it as a specific piece of evidence the defense would use to argue for intervention.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b3573ee1-8fb6-4d07-8572-3a1e1a5480e2\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1264, "completion_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 1479}, "latency_s": 1.002553624974098, "request_id": "ntGUabG8FLnu7M8P587SoAI", "raw_response": null}
