The candidate answer explicitly addresses the need to inform members retroactively in Section 7 ('What to do if you didn\\u2019t inform members before collecting the data'), advising to 'Notify the members retroactively: send an email... explaining what data were collected, why, and that you are now obtaining explicit consent.' Furthermore, Section 4 ('What you *must* tell the members (privacy notice)') details all the required elements (identity, purpose, legal basis, categories of data, rights, etc.) which are then incorporated into the retroactive notification advice. The sample consent text in Section 10 also covers the request for consent for future use. Therefore, the answer fully satisfies the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"92fcd868-81a4-46fa-b724-ebb0e227920f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4462, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 4691}, "latency_s": 1.1859722919762135, "request_id": "D-aUafPIDp2IxN8Ps4HTyAw", "raw_response": null}
