The candidate response includes a 'Control Point 6: Transfer Pricing Alignment' which covers TP documentation and pricing. Under this control point, the reporting cadence states: \\\"Annual to Audit Committee (comprehensive TP report)\\\" and \\\"Quarterly exception reporting for out-of-range transactions\\\". While quarterly reporting exists for exceptions, the primary, comprehensive report is annual. The criterion specifically asks for the *minimum reporting cadence* for the *Transfer Pricing Compliance control* to be quarterly. Since the main report is annual, and the quarterly report is explicitly for exceptions, this does not strictly confirm the minimum cadence is quarterly for the overall compliance status, unlike other controls which explicitly state 'Quarterly to Audit Committee'.\", \"criterion_id\": \"63c199bd-96ce-47c1-b5dd-751d1b859f3c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4012, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 4228}, "latency_s": 1.1749167080270126, "request_id": "z9KUacKZJcD97M8P2J3Q4Qk", "raw_response": null}
