While the criterion specifically mentions that the \\u00a7245A participation exemption does not apply to GILTI inclusions, the response's discussion of GILTI and FTCs in the context of CFCs implies an understanding of the limitations on relief for GILTI income, which is the core issue related to this criterion's context (i.e., GILTI is taxed currently, and FTCs are limited).
