Specifically, under the 'Consent/Veto Catalogue' section, it states: 'Push to embed the most critical vetoes in the Satzung.' Furthermore, under 'Liquidation Preference,' it notes: 'Ensure the Satzung actually creates a preference share class — a purely contractual waterfall in the SHA is enforceable between the parties but does not bind a liquidator or insolvency administrator.' This directly satisfies the criterion regarding advising that provisions affecting share rights must be in the Satzung for enforceability.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f462ad42-2453-401c-bc17-67772f6a802f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4137, "completion_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 4322}, "latency_s": 0.9363780829880852, "request_id": "fr-UaaWgMIb1kdUP6IrTsQU", "raw_response": null}
