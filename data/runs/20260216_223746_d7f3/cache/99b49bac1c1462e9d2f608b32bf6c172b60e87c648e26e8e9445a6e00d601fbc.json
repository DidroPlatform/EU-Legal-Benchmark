The candidate answer explicitly states the opposite: 'From Third Countries (e.g., China): Presumed NOT at risk if declared for NI/UK end-use (green lane possible post-import).' This directly contradicts the required explanation that the presumption remains 'at risk' for goods not covered by the specific WF arrangements (i.e., those destined for the EU or not meeting green lane criteria). While the answer correctly notes the shift in presumption for GB-NI trade, it incorrectly describes the status for third-country goods entering NI that might be destined for the EU or not meeting the green lane criteria, suggesting a presumption of 'not at risk' if declared for UK end-use, which is not the required explanation regarding the default 'at risk' status for non-covered goods.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2f0e047c-09d7-40ee-a04e-af21eca6630e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2710, "completion_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 2959}, "latency_s": 1.182915207988117, "request_id": "7DOVae3RKNqgkdUPg_fLkAM", "raw_response": null}
