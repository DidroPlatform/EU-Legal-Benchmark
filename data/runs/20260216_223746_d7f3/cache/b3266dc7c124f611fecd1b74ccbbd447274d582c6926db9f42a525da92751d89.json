The candidate answer mentions 'High legal costs' and 'potential for adverse costs orders' in the UK, and 'Legal costs can be significant' in Germany, noting the losing party bears costs. For California, it mentions 'High litigation costs'. However, it fails to specifically address or analyze the distinct financial risks listed in the criterion, such as security for costs, specific discovery cost burdens, court fees, bonds, or currency exposure. The analysis of financial risks is too general and does not meet the specificity required by the rubric.\", \"criterion_id\": \"caaf34a3-3fe2-43ac-b7e4-1a6777495c2e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1501, "completion_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 1707}, "latency_s": 0.9338510409579612, "request_id": "NgeVaaadMq2WkdUPiJ3nmQk", "raw_response": null}
