The candidate answer discusses the general possibility of recruiting under private law based on the *nature of the function* (public vs. non-public/delegated), which is the correct general principle for GIPs. However, it does not explicitly address the specific condition mentioned in the criterion: the default regime for personnel when the GIP's main object is a SPIC. While a SPIC often implies private law application for its operational staff, the answer fails to confirm this specific default rule as stated in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e9f93b00-c174-4505-879b-532c4d69711a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4241, "completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 4443}, "latency_s": 1.1591170839965343, "request_id": "5uSUadXXMd_evdIPi9bMuAs", "raw_response": null}
