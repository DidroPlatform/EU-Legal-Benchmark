NO HMRC relationship'. Furthermore, under the 'How to insulate French parent from HMRC liability?' section, it clearly outlines that the UK subsidiary becomes the IOR, meaning the French parent is selling to the subsidiary (an export transaction) and avoids direct HMRC/customs declaration liability, which is the practical implication of it not being able to act as the declarant/IOR for the UK import.\", \"criterion_id\": \"cf77364d-885c-4118-9665-e75f304c088a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4371, "completion_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 4575}, "latency_s": 1.0888569160015322, "request_id": "RcuUacegM_27nsEPhr2MyQM", "raw_response": null}
