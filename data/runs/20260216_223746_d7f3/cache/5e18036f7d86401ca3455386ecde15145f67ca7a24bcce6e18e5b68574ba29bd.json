The candidate answer explicitly argues the opposite: that the drunk driver's swerving (B's act) is the proximate cause, and the chair's fall (the truck driver's initial act) is merely a trigger that does *not* break the chain of causation. The candidate concludes the truck driver (A) is not liable because B's act is the proximate cause, but this conclusion is based on B's act *not* being an intervening act that relieves A of liability; rather, B's act *is* the intervening act that breaks the chain *from A to C*, but B is liable for the result. The criterion specifically asks if the response states that if B's act *is* an intervening act, A is relieved of liability. The candidate analysis focuses on B's liability and concludes that the chain is *not* broken by the chair, meaning A remains potentially liable unless B's act is deemed a *novus actus interveniens* that relieves A. The candidate analysis concludes B's act is the proximate cause, implying A is *not* liable, but it does not explicitly state the condition required by the criterion: 'if the drunk driver's actions [B's swerving] are considered an intervening act [breaking the chain from A], the truck driver [A] will not have any liability for the crash.' While the analysis implies this outcome (that A is relieved of liability because B's act is the proximate cause), it does not state the required conditional premise clearly enough to satisfy the criterion, which focuses on the *truck driver's* liability being negated by the *drunk driver's* intervening act.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1f01980d-6a77-455d-a337-952c9912c668\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3205, "completion_tokens": 432, "total_tokens": 3637}, "latency_s": 1.9743525419617072, "request_id": "qu-Uaa_tOK3L-8YP3rPf4AI", "raw_response": null}
