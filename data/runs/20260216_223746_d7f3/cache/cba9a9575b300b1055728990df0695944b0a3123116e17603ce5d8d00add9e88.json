The candidate answer correctly identifies the relevant Chilean competition authority (FNE) and states that filings are required, listing Chile under the Competition section: 'Chile | FNE | Thresholds (2023 approx.) | Pre-closing; 30 days Phase I.' While the candidate cites the wrong specific law (it mentions Ley 18.046/1981 in Section 1, and does not explicitly cite Decreto Ley 211), it correctly identifies the *requirement* for merger notification to the *FNE* in Chile, which is the core functional requirement implied by the criterion's focus on competition filings in Chile. Given the context of a comprehensive M&A outline, identifying the correct authority (FNE) and the requirement for filing satisfies the intent of the criterion, even if the specific decree number cited in the rubric is missing, as the candidate correctly identifies the Chilean competition filing requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9b7ae9ee-f2cc-4e51-850b-dc8702070b7d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2854, "completion_tokens": 260, "total_tokens": 3114}, "latency_s": 1.3160756659926847, "request_id": "dDKVaf7mMsyynsEPyd_uiAQ", "raw_response": null}
