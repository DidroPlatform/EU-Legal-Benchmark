While the date mentioned in the criterion (Dec 31, 2020) is the *entry into force* date for the Protocol (as part of the WA), and the candidate lists the *signing* date (Oct 24, 2019) and the *UK exit* date (Jan 31, 2020), the context clearly establishes the existence and effect of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol around the end of 2020, which is the core intent of the criterion. Furthermore, Section 6 lists the primary source document, the 'Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland (2020)', confirming the reference to the relevant 2020 agreement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"478156e1-1f49-43cf-88bb-b4424f0454ba\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3946, "completion_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 4237}, "latency_s": 0.9978162909974344, "request_id": "CvKUabbvBceC7M8P_tvRkAs", "raw_response": null}
