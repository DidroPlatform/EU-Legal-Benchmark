Furthermore, in Section I, point 3, it discusses the potential defense of parody/satire under Italian law (Art. 70), noting that the bar is high and the work must not be 'just a commercial rip-off,' which aligns with the concept that associating the work with an unrelated cause (like a worker's rights movement) without permission violates the right of integrity unless a strong defense like parody applies. The core concept that the right of integrity makes it a violation to associate a copyrighted work with an unassociated cause is covered.\", \"criterion_id\": \"72f92aac-0d46-4c0e-a5ca-990c3e6c5a46\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2906, "completion_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 3119}, "latency_s": 0.9274169999989681, "request_id": "ZAKVaYHHFfnOnsEPkprNkQM", "raw_response": null}
