The candidate answer analyzes the PE risk extensively and concludes that the treaty benefit is highly fragile due to PPT and beneficial ownership challenges, suggesting the structure is likely to fail or be uneconomic. While it discusses the conditions under which the treaty benefit *could* be obtained (i.e., if the CV is substantive and avoids PE), it ultimately advises against the structure due to the high risk of failure, rather than affirmatively stating that obtaining the benefit is possible under the specified conditions. The analysis focuses more on the high probability of failure (PPT, beneficial ownership) than on the possibility of success contingent on avoiding PE.\", \"criterion_id\": \"41118527-14e6-443d-a588-f584d629adec\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2650, "completion_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 2858}, "latency_s": 1.0220169999811333, "request_id": "6EeUaZaqBIbXvdIPtrWcqAE", "raw_response": null}
