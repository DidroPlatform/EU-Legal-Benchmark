Section 2.1 (s.76 CJIA 2008) and Section 2.2 (Common Law Test) both address the necessity of force in response to a threat. Specifically, s.76(3) requires the force to be proportionate to the threat of violence, and s.76(6)-(7) notes that pre-emptive force is allowed if the threat is imminent, referencing *Palmer v R* [1971] AC 814, which deals with the immediacy requirement. Furthermore, Section 3.1 notes that the defence fails if excessive force is used after the threat has passed (referencing *R v Clegg*), which implies the necessity must relate to an ongoing or immediately apprehended threat. The brief clearly frames the defence around the client's belief in an imminent threat ('feared for his life,' 'believed force was necessary,' 'threat imminent').\", \"criterion_id\": \"74ca3b09-c13e-4143-b0da-ede48e93caee\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2232, "completion_tokens": 270, "total_tokens": 2502}, "latency_s": 1.1497016670182347, "request_id": "VCWVaf3EC9qfnsEPzfyNyAM", "raw_response": null}
