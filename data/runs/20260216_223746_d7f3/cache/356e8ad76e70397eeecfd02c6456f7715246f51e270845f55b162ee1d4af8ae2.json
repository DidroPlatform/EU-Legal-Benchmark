NL taxes non-residents on NL-source business profits (25% CIT) if PE exists.\n\n- **Triggers (Art. 5 OECD/UK-NL DTA)**:  \n  - **Fixed place**: GP office/server in NL used for LP's licensing = PE (unless prep/auxiliary).  \n  - **Dependent agent**: GP habitually concludes/substantially negotiates IP licenses for LP = PE.  \n- **Facts driving risk**: Nominal GP (e.g., admin service provider) + UK-based decisions = STA argues GP is \"puppet,\" attributing place/agency to LP. Supreme Court (HR 2010/Spanair, 2019 cases) often sides with taxpayer if GP lacks binding authority (needs LP sign-off), but STA challenges aggressively post-BEPS.  \n- **Attribution**: Full royalty profits less direct expenses (no DTA Art. 7 \"facts & circumstances\" arm's length yet).  \n- **Mitigation odds**: Low-medium. Add NL substance (qualifying R&D/employees in GP/CV) flips to safe PE but enables innovation box (9% ETR). No substance = audit/PE assertion likely.  \n**Bottom line**: 60-80% PE risk without substance; expect NL tax ~20% net of costs (vs. UK patent box 10%).\n\n### Treaty Benefit Hold-Up (NL-SG DTA for CV)\n**Will hold for 10% WHT cap (same as SG domestic), but irrelevant/no savings.**  \n- SG domestic: 10% WHT on patent royalties to non-residents (IRAS s45E ITA).  \n- NL-SG DTA (1971, MLI): Art. 12 caps at 10% gross (no reduction; all royalties qualify).  \n- **CV eligibility**:  \n  - NL view: CV \"resident\" (place of effective management); benefits pass-through to LP if NL-taxed (or PE).  \n  - SG view: OK if Form on file + beneficial owner (CV/LP). Transparent = risk denial if \"no real business\" (BEPS Action 6 LOB-lite).  \n- **MLI PPT killer**: High denial risk – principal purpose = WHT avoidance/routing (even if 0% savings). SG/NL both opted in; no PPR.  \n- **Direct alt (UK LP)**: Better – UK-SG DTA Art. 12 = **0% WHT**. But LP transparency = SG denial risk (no \"taxable entity\"; partners must claim, disclosure heavy).  \n\n**Bottom line**: Structure saves 0% WHT vs. direct (if UK-SG holds); exposes NL PE + PPT audit. Pointless unless for NL innovation box (requires BV, not CV) or deferral.
