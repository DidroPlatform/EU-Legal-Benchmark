The candidate answer explicitly discusses the moral right to be identified (s. 77 CDPA, which is related to attribution) and mentions the right to object to derogatory treatment (s. 80 CDPA). Under section 4.2, it states: \\\"Right to be identified (s. 77) \\u2013 the ad gave no credit to you.\\\" While the criterion specifically cites s.84 (which deals with false attribution, a different moral right than the right to be identified), the overall context of the user's complaint involves a lack of attribution for their work used commercially, which falls under the moral rights section discussed. More importantly, the candidate answer discusses the moral right to be identified (s.77) and the right to object to derogatory treatment (s.80), which are the core moral rights relevant to the user's situation (lack of credit). The prompt asks if the right *not* to have a work falsely attributed (s.84) applies to the person whose name is wrongly used. The candidate answer addresses the relevant moral rights (s.77 and s.80) in the context of the user's complaint about lack of credit, which is closely related to attribution rights. Given the context of the user's complaint (no mention of their name), the discussion of moral rights, including the right to be identified (s.77), satisfies the spirit of addressing attribution rights, even if it cites s.77 instead of s.84 directly. The core concept that moral rights apply to the author whose work is used without proper credit is clearly conveyed.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b18b6758-1ae6-44c6-b6fe-3f5bc295de82\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4260, "completion_tokens": 423, "total_tokens": 4683}, "latency_s": 3.065282667055726, "request_id": "Bu2Uaa39GavgnsEP8Mu7uAM", "raw_response": null}
