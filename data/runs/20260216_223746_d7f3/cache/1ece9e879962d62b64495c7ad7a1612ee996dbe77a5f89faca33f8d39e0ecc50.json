{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 0, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires the model to mention the Noise Act 1996. The candidate answer mentions the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Police's ability to issue fixed penalty notices under the Noise Act 1996, but it does not explicitly mention the 'Noise Act 1996' as a standalone piece of legislation governing the nuisance itself, only in the context of police action regarding excessive noise at night. Specifically, under section 4(B) it states: \\\"Noise Act 1996 \\u2013 Police can issue fixed penalty notices (\\u00a3100) for excessive noise at night (11pm\\u20137am).\\\" This is a mention, but it is listed under the section discussing police action rather than the general statutory nuisance framework (which is covered by the EPA 1990). Given the strict nature of the evaluation, and that the Act is indeed mentioned, I will re-evaluate. The mention is present under section 4B: \\\"Noise Act 1996 \\u2013 Police can issue fixed penalty notices (\\u00a3100) for excessive noise at night (11pm\\u20137am).\\\". Since the Act is explicitly named, the criterion is technically met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b0320098-93a5-4d3e-a68c-e312f5124f3e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2420, "completion_tokens": 334, "total_tokens": 2754}, "latency_s": 1.270175166951958, "request_id": "RfuUab3TG8PwnsEPpffzuQM", "raw_response": null}
