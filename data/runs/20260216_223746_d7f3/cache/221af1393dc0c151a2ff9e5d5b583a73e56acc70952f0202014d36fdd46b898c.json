The candidate answer discusses the balancing test applied by the English court (Section 3) and, specifically in Section 6 (Likely outcomes), addresses scenarios based on asset location. For instance, it notes that if assets are in the UK and arbitration is pre-constituted, the court is likely to grant the injunction. Furthermore, Step 6 of the balancing test explicitly mentions 'Enforceability abroad' and the location of assets, which is intrinsically linked to the court's jurisdiction and discretion over those assets. While it doesn't use the exact phrase 'territorial connection of assets within England,' the entire framework of granting a Mareva injunction (which freezes assets) inherently relies on the court having jurisdiction over those assets, which is established by their location (territorial connection). The discussion of assets being in the UK versus Singapore confirms this factor is central to the court's discretion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ebb10f2f-ed59-42f4-b7c9-60619dd34bfe\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3882, "completion_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 4140}, "latency_s": 0.9779519159928896, "request_id": "1uqUaZCPA_CMkdUPn6WNwAE", "raw_response": null}
