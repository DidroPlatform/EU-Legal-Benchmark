{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"score\": 0.45, \"pass\": false, \"rationale\": \"The candidate answer is overly focused on Swiss law (FADP) and introduces unnecessary complexity by assuming a Swiss context for a Norwegian company (X AS). The reference answer correctly identifies the primary applicable data protection law as the GDPR (since Norway is EEA) and focuses on the core issues: GDPR applicability, the CLOUD Act conflict, and corruption risks (UK Bribery Act/FCPA). The candidate correctly identifies the GDPR/CLOUD Act conflict but incorrectly prioritizes the Swiss FADP. Furthermore, the candidate introduces several irrelevant or speculative legal frameworks (e.g., HIPAA, specific Norwegian health laws without context, detailed analysis of Swiss StGB) that dilute the focus on the core issues highlighted in the reference answer (GDPR, CLOUD Act, FCPA/UKBA). The structure is comprehensive but deviates significantly from the direct legal issues raised by the prompt and addressed in the reference answer. The reference answer is much more direct and relevant to the facts provided (Norwegian company, Irish/US cloud provider, Indian subsidiary).\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.45}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3657, "completion_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 3895}, "latency_s": 1.3910857499577105, "request_id": "GQOVaeOXHJjknsEPxt7C0AU", "raw_response": null}
