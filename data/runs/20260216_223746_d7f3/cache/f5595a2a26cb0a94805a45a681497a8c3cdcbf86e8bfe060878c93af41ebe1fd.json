They can act as the IOR on your behalf, handling all import formalities.\n\n2. **Customs Classification and Origin Declaration:**\n   - First, confirm the HS codes for both the Lyon and Alpine models. The R454B refrigerant in the Alpine model might indeed lead to a different classification.\n   - If the classifications differ, you have two options:\n     a) Split the shipment into two separate consignments (more costly but cleaner from a customs perspective)\n     b) Apply for a Binding Tariff Information (BTI) ruling from HMRC to get official confirmation on classification\n   - For origin declaration, check if both products can qualify under the same origin rules. If they're both manufactured in the EU, you might be able to use the same origin declaration.\n\n3. **VAT Handling:**\n   - As the seller, you can register for UK VAT (even without a physical presence) through the UK's VAT registration process for non-established taxable persons.\n   - Alternatively, your third-party IOR could handle VAT on your behalf.\n\n4. **Legal Structure:**\n   To insulate your French parent company:\n   - Consider setting up a UK limited company (this can be done relatively quickly, often within days)\n   - Alternatively, use a local agent or distributor who can take on the IOR role and associated liabilities\n\n5. **Immediate Action Plan:**\n   - Contact a UK customs broker or freight forwarder who offers IOR services\n   - Apply for UK VAT registration\n   - Consult with the broker about the mixed consignment issue and whether splitting is necessary\n   - Consider applying for a BTI ruling if classification is uncertain\n\n6. **Long-term Solution:**\n   - Establish a UK entity to properly handle future imports and VAT obligations\n   - This would give you more control and potentially reduce costs over time\n\nThe most immediate solution that balances legal compliance with operational practicality would be to engage a third-party IOR service in the UK while you work on establishing your own UK entity. This approach allows you to continue shipping while addressing the customs and VAT issues properly.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this solution or provide more details about the process for any of these steps?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 242, "completion_tokens": 1090, "total_tokens": 1332}, "latency_s": 60.693645583989564, "request_id": "8c8571e6702240ffb739859bd50d6a35", "raw_response": null}
