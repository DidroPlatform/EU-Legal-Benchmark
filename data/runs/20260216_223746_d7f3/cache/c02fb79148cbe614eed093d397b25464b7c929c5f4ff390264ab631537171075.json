The candidate answer states that a counterclaim is admissible if the treaty 'expressly or implicitly' gives consent, and it is 'connected' to the investor's claim. Furthermore, the candidate explicitly notes that for the specific scenario (silent BIT), the language is 'broad enough to cover a host-state claim *provided* the claim is linked,' implying admissibility is common under implied consent and connection tests. This contradicts the strict assertion required by the criterion that counterclaims are *usually inadmissible* without express mention. The candidate presents a nuanced view where implied consent is often sufficient, which is the opposite of the required assertion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"191e67ef-7b2a-4b3a-a1e2-fe9e20a8a0b8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3272, "completion_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 3470}, "latency_s": 0.9501434999983758, "request_id": "Le6UaZ_DAqzd7M8PoNSSsQM", "raw_response": null}
