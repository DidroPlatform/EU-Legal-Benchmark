The candidate answer focuses almost entirely on the strategy and advantages for the *client* (the US software company, who is the respondent in the arbitration). It mentions the filing party's actions (e.g., filing first, nominating an arbitrator) but frames these as procedural steps to be countered, not as inherent advantages the filing party enjoys that the response should highlight for strategic planning. For example, it notes the filing party presents first, but this is buried in the context of general arbitration strategy rather than explicitly listed as an advantage the filing party gains.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a43ebcba-95a5-4cb1-8957-742a8c0d3ffe\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2709, "completion_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 2908}, "latency_s": 1.0392277920036577, "request_id": "EdKUabTFG9D-nsEPgIiFuAU", "raw_response": null}
