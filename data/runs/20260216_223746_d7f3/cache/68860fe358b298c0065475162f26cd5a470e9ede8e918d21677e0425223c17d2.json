It is mentioned as something to 'Clarify' before signing, not necessarily a clause within the contract itself regarding payment terms.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b46b7cfb-5908-49f9-9de8-8741d5f6ff20\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 766, "completion_tokens": 161, "total_tokens": 927}, "latency_s": 0.9848992920015007, "request_id": "SNeUac3tN-iXkdUPtIrQkAU", "raw_response": null}
