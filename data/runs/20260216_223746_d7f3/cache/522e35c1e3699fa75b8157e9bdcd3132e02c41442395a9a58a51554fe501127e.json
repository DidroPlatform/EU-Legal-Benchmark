{"provider": "bedrock", "model": "bedrock/converse/openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0", "text": "**Subject:** Likely Outcome of the Review‑Board Proceedings under the Convention on Conduct of Fishing Operations in the North Atlantic (the “Convention”) – Refusal of the Spanish vessel to cooperate with Belgian authorised officers  \n\n**From:** [Your Name], Legal Adviser, Ministry of Foreign Affairs – Division of International Treaties  \n**To:** Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Maritime Affairs – Spain  \n**Date:** 16 February 2026  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Background (facts supplied)\n\n1. Belgian authorised officers, acting under the powers conferred on them by **Article 9** of the Convention, observed that a set of fishing lines anchored in the sea was **not marked** in accordance with **Article 5** (Annex IV).  \n2. The officers approached the Spanish vessel to **request information** about the gear and to draw the crew’s attention to the marking requirement.  \n3. The Spanish officers on board **refused to cooperate**.  \n4. Belgium subsequently filed a report with the review board, alleging that the Spanish officers’ refusal constitutes an additional breach of Spain’s obligations under the Convention.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Relevant provisions of the Convention  \n\n| Provision | Content | Relevance to the present dispute |\n|-----------|---------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Art. 5** | Nets, lines and other gear anchored in the sea shall be **marked** (Annex IV). | The gear in question was un‑marked – a prima facie breach by the Spanish vessel. |\n| **Art. 9(4)** | Authorised officers shall **co‑operate** with officers of other Contracting Parties for the purposes of the Convention. | The Belgian officers were exercising a function that, under Art. 9(4), requires cooperation from the Spanish crew. |\n| **Art. 9(5)‑(6)** | An authorised officer who has reason to believe a vessel is not complying may **identify the vessel, seek necessary information, order the vessel to stop and, if necessary, board it** for enquiry and report. | The Belgian officers had a legitimate basis (un‑marked gear) to request information. |\n| **Art. 9(8)** | The enquiry must be **no more than necessary** to determine whether a breach has occurred. | The Belgian request was limited to information about the gear – proportionate to the suspected breach. |\n| **Art. 9(10)** | **Resistance** by a vessel to the directions of an authorised officer is deemed **resistance to the authority of the flag State**. | The Spanish crew’s refusal is characterised as “resistance” under the Convention. |\n| **Art. 14(3)** (Reservations) | A Party may reserve the application of **Art. 9(5)‑(6)** to those Contracting Parties that have made a similar reservation. | Spain made the reservation, but **only** with respect to those Parties that *themselves* have made a reservation. Belgium has **not** made such a reservation; therefore the reservation **does not shield Spain** vis‑à‑vis Belgium. |\n| **Art. 7** | Disputes concerning alleged breaches are to be referred to a **review board** (or other appropriate authority). | The present matter falls squarely within Art. 7. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Interpretation of the provisions (authoritative guidance)\n\n1. **Scope of the officer’s powers** – Art. 9(5)‑(6) expressly authorises an officer to *“identify the vessel, seek to obtain the necessary information … and, if the matter is sufficiently serious, order the vessel to stop and, if necessary, board the vessel for enquiry.”* The Belgian officers merely **requested information**; they did **not** order the vessel to stop or board it. Their conduct is therefore fully within the limits set by the Convention.\n\n2. **Obligation to cooperate** – Art. 9(4) creates a **mutual‑co‑operation** duty. The Spanish crew’s refusal is a breach of that duty, independent of any alleged breach of the marking requirement.\n\n3. **Effect of Spain’s reservation** – The reservation language (Art. 14(3) & the Spanish declaration) states that Art. 9(5)‑(6) are binding **only** against Parties that have *not* made the same reservation. Because Belgium has **not** made the reservation, Art. 9(5)‑(6) remain **binding on Spain** in its relations with Belgium. The reservation therefore **does not excuse** the refusal.\n\n4. **Resistance as resistance to the flag State** – Under Art. 9(10) the refusal is deemed “resistance to the authority of the flag State.” This gives Belgium a clear legal basis to consider the act a breach of Spain’s obligations.\n\n5. **Proportionality** – Art. 9(8) requires that the officer’s enquiry be no more than necessary. The request for information about un‑marked gear is precisely the minimal step required to verify compliance with Art. 5. Consequently, the Belgian officers acted **lawfully and proportionately**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. How the Review Board is likely to decide  \n\n| Issue | Expected finding of the Review Board | Rationale |\n|-------|--------------------------------------|-----------|\n| **(a) Un‑marked gear** | **Breach** of Art. 5 (Annex IV) by the Spanish vessel. | The gear was observed to be un‑marked; the marking requirements are clear and mandatory. |\n| **(b) Failure to cooperate with authorised officer** | **Breach** of Art. 9(4) and Art. 9(5)‑(6). | The officer acted within his powers; the Spanish crew’s refusal constitutes non‑co‑operation and, under Art. 9(10), “resistance”. |\n| **(c) Effect of Spain’s reservation** | **Reservation does not apply**; the obligations remain binding vis‑à‑vis Belgium. | Belgium has not made the same reservation; therefore Art. 9(5)‑(6) are fully applicable. |\n| **(d) Remedy** | The Board will likely **recommend**: <br>‑ Immediate compliance with the marking requirement; <br>‑ Provision of the requested information to the Belgian authorities; <br>‑ A written apology acknowledging the breach; <br>‑ Assurance that future cooperation will be given to authorised officers of any Contracting Party. | The Convention (Art. 8) obliges each Party to take appropriate measures to enforce its provisions. The Board’s role is to achieve a settlement, not to impose punitive sanctions, but a finding of breach will trigger the obligation to remedy. |\n\nIn sum, the Review Board is expected to **affirm Belgium’s report** and to find that Spain has violated both the **gear‑marking rule** and the **co‑operation duty** of authorised officers. The Board will likely order Spain to remedy the marking deficiency and to provide the information requested, together with a commitment to cooperate in future encounters.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Practical consequences for Spain  \n\n1. **Legal exposure** – A finding of breach may be used by Belgium (or any other Party) as a basis for **further diplomatic protest** or, if damage results, for **compensation claims** under Art. 7(2).  \n2. **Reputational impact** – Repeated refusals could be cited in future fisheries‑management negotiations, potentially affecting Spain’s standing within the Convention’s bodies.  \n3. **Operational impact** – Belgian authorised officers may, in future, feel empowered to **board** Spanish vessels (subject to Art. 9(5)‑(6)) if similar un‑marked gear is observed.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Recommendations for the Spanish Government  \n\n| Action | Why it matters |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **A. Immediate compliance with the marking requirement** – Deploy the required flag or radar‑reflector buoys (day) and light buoys (night) as set out in **Annex IV, Rule 1**. | Removes the primary factual breach and eliminates the basis for further officer enquiries. |\n| **B. Provide the information requested by the Belgian officers** – Identify the vessel, present the registration documents (Annex II, Rule 2) and explain the status of the gear. | Satisfies Art. 9(4)‑(6) and demonstrates good‑faith cooperation, mitigating the breach finding. |\n| **C. Issue a formal note to Belgium** acknowledging the misunderstanding, confirming that the refusal was *not* intended as resistance, and confirming future compliance with Art. 9. | Helps the Review Board reach a settlement and may avoid any escalation to arbitration or the ICJ. |\n| **D. Review internal procedures** – Ensure that all Spanish‑flagged vessels operating in the Convention area are briefed on the duties of foreign authorised officers and on the marking obligations. | Prevents recurrence and strengthens Spain’s position in any future dispute. |\n| **E. Clarify the scope of the reservation** – If Spain wishes to limit the application of Art. 9(5)‑(6) to *all* other Parties, a formal amendment to the reservation (via the amendment procedures of Art. 14) would be required. Until such amendment is effected, the reservation does **not** protect Spain in this case. | Avoids future confusion about the legal effect of the reservation. |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Conclusion  \n\nBased on a plain‑language reading of the Convention, the **review board is very likely to find that Spain has breached both the gear‑marking rule (Art. 5) and the co‑operation duty of authorised officers (Art. 9(4)‑(6), Art. 9(10))**. Spain’s reservation concerning Art. 9(5)‑(6) does **not** exempt it from liability vis‑à‑vis Belgium, because Belgium has not made a corresponding reservation.  \n\nPrompt remedial action—marking the gear, providing the requested information, and formally acknowledging the breach—will enable Spain to **settle the matter at the review‑board stage**, avoid any further diplomatic friction, and preserve its standing under the Convention.\n\nPlease let us know if you require a more detailed briefing, a draft note to Belgium, or assistance in revising internal vessel‑compliance procedures.\n\n---  \n\n**Prepared by:**  \n[Your Name]  \nLegal Adviser – International Fisheries Law  \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs (or relevant department)  \n\n*Attachments:* (i) Extract of Art. 9(4)‑(6) and Art. 9(10); (ii) Annex IV, Rule 1 (marking of anchored gear); (iii) Text of Spain’s reservation (Art. 14 para 3).
