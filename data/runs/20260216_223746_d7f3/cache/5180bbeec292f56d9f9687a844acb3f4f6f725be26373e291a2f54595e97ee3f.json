The candidate answer starts with 'No, you won't be arrested...' but immediately contradicts this by stating, 'If you're driving alone without these [supervision], you *could* face penalties' and 'if they do check and you're driving alone without proper supervision, you could get fined or points on your license.' While the initial statement addresses arrest directly, the subsequent caveats about penalties (fines/points) for driving illegally under provisional rules make the overall assertion that they 'won't be arrested' misleading or incomplete, as illegal driving can lead to arrest, even if the primary penalty mentioned is a fine/points. Crucially, the response implies that driving alone *is* illegal under provisional rules (which it is), and the consequence for illegal driving is not strictly limited to 'not being arrested.' Since the response hedges the initial 'No' with strong warnings about penalties for the exact scenario described (driving alone after failing), it does not clearly and unequivocally state that arrest will not happen.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f2288b82-d1dc-4118-bd2b-c7b781210d1e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 589, "completion_tokens": 274, "total_tokens": 863}, "latency_s": 1.4125741659954656, "request_id": "iteUadKPE8SzkdUP4ZaoqQU", "raw_response": null}
