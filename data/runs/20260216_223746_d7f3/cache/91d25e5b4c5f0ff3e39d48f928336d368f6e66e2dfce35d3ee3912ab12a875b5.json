Here's a comprehensive guide to what you should look out for and include in the contract.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Territory and Exclusivity\n\n- **Define the territory precisely** — all of Canada, specific provinces, or specific channels?\n- **Exclusive vs. non-exclusive** — if the distributor wants exclusivity, tie it to **minimum purchase/performance obligations** so they can't just sit on the territory\n- Consider whether you want to reserve the right to sell directly (e.g., online sales to Canadian customers)\n\n## 2. Products Covered\n\n- Clearly define **which products** are covered — all current products? Future products?\n- Retain the right to **modify, discontinue, or add products**\n- Specify who handles **product registration, certification, or regulatory compliance** in Canada (this can be costly)\n\n## 3. Pricing and Payment Terms\n\n- **Currency** — will you invoice in GBP, CAD, or USD? Who bears the exchange rate risk?\n- **Payment terms** — net 30, net 60? Consider requiring letters of credit or payment guarantees initially\n- **Price revision mechanism** — how and when can you adjust prices?\n- **Incoterms** — critically important. These determine who pays for shipping, insurance, customs duties, and at what point risk transfers. Common ones include:\n  - **EXW** (Ex Works) — buyer bears almost all costs\n  - **CIF/CIP** — you cover cost, insurance, and freight to a named port/place\n  - **DDP** (Delivered Duty Paid) — you bear all costs including import duties\n  - Get advice on which works best for you\n\n## 4. Minimum Purchase Obligations\n\n- **Essential if granting exclusivity** — set annual or quarterly minimum order quantities or values\n- Include a **ratchet mechanism** (increasing minimums over time)\n- Specify consequences of failing to meet minimums (e.g., loss of exclusivity, right to terminate)\n\n## 5. Intellectual Property Protection\n\n- **Your brand, trademarks, and IP remain yours** — state this explicitly\n- The distributor should have a **licence to use your marks only for the purpose of distribution**\n- Require that the distributor **does not register your trademarks** in Canada in their own name (this happens more than you'd think)\n- All goodwill generated accrues to you\n- Consider registering your trademarks in Canada yourself before entering the market\n\n## 6. Regulatory and Compliance\n\n- **Canadian product standards** — depending on your product, there may be specific Canadian regulations (labelling in English AND French is mandatory, product safety standards, etc.)\n- **Who is responsible for compliance?** This needs to be clear\n- Consider **product liability** — Canadian product liability laws will apply to products sold there\n- **Sanctions and export controls** — ensure compliance with both UK and Canadian trade regulations\n\n## 7. Term and Termination\n\n- **Fixed term with renewal options** is generally safer than an indefinite term\n- Start with a **shorter initial term** (1-2 years) to test the relationship\n- Include termination rights for:\n  - Material breach (with cure period)\n  - Insolvency\n  - Failure to meet minimums\n  - Convenience (with reasonable notice — be careful here, see below)\n- **Post-termination obligations** — what happens to existing stock, outstanding orders, customer relationships?\n\n> ⚠️ **Important warning**: Some Canadian provinces have legislation or case law that can imply reasonable notice periods for termination of distribution agreements, and distributors may claim compensation on termination. Get legal advice on this.\n\n## 8. Liability and Indemnification\n\n- **Limit your liability** where possible\n- **Product liability** — who carries insurance? Require the distributor to maintain adequate insurance\n- **Indemnification** — the distributor should indemnify you for claims arising from their actions (misuse, misrepresentation, etc.)\n- You should consider your own **product liability insurance** covering the Canadian market\n\n## 9. Dispute Resolution\n\n- **Governing law** — English law or Canadian law? You'll likely prefer English law, but the distributor may push back\n- **Jurisdiction** — courts or arbitration? For international contracts, **arbitration** (e.g., ICC, LCIA) is often preferred because:\n  - Arbitral awards are more easily enforced internationally under the New York Convention\n  - Both the UK and Canada are signatories\n- If you choose courts, consider enforceability of judgments\n\n## 10. Confidentiality and Non-Compete\n\n- Protect your **commercial information, pricing, customer data, and trade secrets**\n- Consider a **non-compete clause** during and for a reasonable period after the agreement\n- Be aware that overly broad non-competes may not be enforceable\n\n## 11. Customs, Duties, and Trade Agreements\n\n- Check the **UK-Canada trade position** — the UK-Canada Trade Continuity Agreement (TCA) rolled over elements of CETA after Brexit, providing preferential tariff rates on many goods\n- Ensure you understand **rules of origin** requirements to qualify for preferential tariffs\n- Clarify who is the **importer of record** (usually the distributor)\n\n## 12. Reporting and Transparency\n\n- Require **regular sales reports** from the distributor\n- Right to **audit** the distributor's records\n- Require the distributor to share **market intelligence and customer feedback**\n\n## 13. Relationship Characterisation\n\n- Make clear the distributor is an **independent contractor**, not your agent or employee\n- This matters for **tax and legal liability** — if they're characterised as your agent, you could have a taxable presence (permanent establishment) in Canada\n- Get tax advice on whether the arrangement could create a **Canadian tax exposure** for you\n\n---\n\n## Practical Recommendations\n\n| Action | Priority |\n|---|---|\n| Engage a lawyer experienced in international distribution (ideally with UK-Canada expertise) | **Critical** |\n| Register your trademarks in Canada | **High** |\n| Check product regulatory requirements for Canada | **High** |\n| Review your product liability insurance for international coverage | **High** |\n| Do due diligence on the distributor (financial health, reputation, track record) | **High** |\n| Understand the tax implications (VAT/GST, corporate tax, permanent establishment risk) | **High** |\n| Consult on Incoterms and shipping logistics | **Medium-High** |\n\n---\n\n## One Final Piece of Advice\n\n**Do not sign the distributor's standard contract without independent legal review.** The proposal you've received will almost certainly be drafted in the distributor's favour. It's well worth the investment to have a solicitor review or draft the agreement — the cost of getting it wrong (being locked into a bad exclusive deal, losing your IP, unexpected tax liabilities) far outweighs the legal fees.\n\nWould you like me to go deeper into any particular area?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 60, "completion_tokens": 1622, "total_tokens": 1682}, "latency_s": 35.62477670799126, "request_id": "chatcmpl-8410b7ba-c451-479c-a8b9-d560bc8aca84", "raw_response": null}
