Furthermore, under the 'Disadvantages/Risks' for the FRA, it notes: 'Independent third-party FRA is strong evidence of diligence (courts value experts, e.g., R v Tangerine Confectionery [2011]). No PAT mention = not your gap if focused on \\\"fire\\\" (not electrical).' While it doesn't explicitly state the owner is *responsible* for the third party's error, it clearly frames the *insufficiency* of the report (even if outsourced) as a major risk/disadvantage to the owner, implying the owner bears the ultimate burden of ensuring suitability under FSO Art.9, which is the core concept tested by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"96af97b1-4044-42bb-9b71-15102a04a27e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2468, "completion_tokens": 281, "total_tokens": 2749}, "latency_s": 1.2144431250053458, "request_id": "rymVaa7zAseC7M8P_tvRkAs", "raw_response": null}
