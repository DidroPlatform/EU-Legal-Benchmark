The candidate answer explicitly addresses intervening acts (the truck driver's negligence and the second driver's actions) and concludes that they do not break the chain of causation because they were 'foreseeable' (in the case of the truck driver) or because the second driver's actions were a 'foreseeable consequence' and there was no suggestion they acted 'unreasonably'.
