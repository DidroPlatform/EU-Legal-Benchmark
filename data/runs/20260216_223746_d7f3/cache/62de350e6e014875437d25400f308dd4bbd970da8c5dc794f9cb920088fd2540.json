It only states that hybrid dividends should be avoided to *preserve* eligibility, which implies they disqualify the dividend, but it does not make the direct negative assertion required by the rubric.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3ed4a2a0-3f87-456e-81c3-7a1566489e89\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2298, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 2521}, "latency_s": 0.7509997499873862, "request_id": "2SCVaYqjKuyOkdUP_ZOcgQk", "raw_response": null}
