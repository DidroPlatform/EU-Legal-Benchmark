The candidate answer focuses heavily on responding to the court claim (filing a defence, counter-claims, evidence gathering) and potential consequences like cost orders or damages. It does not explicitly mention issuing a 'formal complaint' outside of the court process (e.g., to a regulatory body or ombudsman, although regulatory action is mentioned in a table, it is not framed as a proactive step the tenant should take as a 'formal complaint'). The closest mention is in Section 5, which lists 'Regulatory action' if the landlord commits serious breaches, but this is presented as a consequence, not a proactive step the tenant can take as a 'formal complaint'.\", \"criterion_id\": \"39b2fe0c-b893-4267-a6d1-9fe70bed5f8c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4037, "completion_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 4240}, "latency_s": 11.063904750044458, "request_id": "m-6UaaL6BsHH-8YPne_2qQI", "raw_response": null}
