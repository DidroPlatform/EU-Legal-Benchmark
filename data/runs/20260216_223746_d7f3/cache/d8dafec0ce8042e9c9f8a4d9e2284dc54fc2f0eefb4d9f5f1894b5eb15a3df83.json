The response mentions a 75% threshold in the context of triggering a Drag-Along right (Section 1.A and Section 5), but this is a *contractual* threshold agreed upon in the SHA, not the *statutory* threshold required by the GmbH Act for fundamental decisions like amending the Articles of Association (§ 53 GmbHG) or capital increases (§ 55 GmbHG). The statutory threshold for these fundamental changes is typically a **three-quarters majority of the votes cast** at a shareholders' meeting, provided that at least **two-thirds of the share capital** is represented (§ 53(1) GmbHG).
