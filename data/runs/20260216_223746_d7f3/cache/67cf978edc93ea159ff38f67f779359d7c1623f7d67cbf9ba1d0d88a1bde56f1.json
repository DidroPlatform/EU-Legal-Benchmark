The candidate answer correctly identifies the shared responsibility and the owner's duty to enforce lease terms, but it does not explicitly state the condition that the blame would be *equal* if the FRA *had* mentioned electrical maintenance. Instead, it suggests the lessee is primarily to blame (70-90%) and the owner is secondarily liable, which contradicts the premise of 'equal blame' under the specified condition. Furthermore, the candidate states the FRA *did not* mention PAT testing, which is the factual scenario given, not the hypothetical condition required by the rubric criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"182b94af-8003-4587-b1f7-70b8f5270bf1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2488, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 2704}, "latency_s": 0.9749140000203624, "request_id": "mymVadpdyOXszw_045WIBg", "raw_response": null}
