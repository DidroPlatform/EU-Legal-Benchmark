INCORRECT - Roman law divided treasure found on another's land differently depending on circumstances, not uniformly in halves. ii. INCORRECT - Legal sociologists observe societal phenomena first, then may develop normative theories; they don't prescribe ends before observation. iii. INCORRECT - Abstract/direct challenges result in rescission of legislation; concrete/indirect challenges result in the administrative decision being repealed, but the provision itself is not annulled (this statement is actually correct). However, the distinction and consequences described are accurate in most constitutional systems. iv. INCORRECT - Swiss civil procedure requires courts to admit relevant evidence; courts cannot refuse admissible evidence merely because they deem it irrelevant. v. INCORRECT - The Act of Mediation (1803) ended the Helvetic Republic and established the Swiss Confederation; it did not found the Helvetic Republic (which existed 1798-1803). Statements i, ii, iv, and v are clearly incorrect. Statement iii is also problematic in its formulation.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 323, "completion_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 569}, "latency_s": 4.090788457979215, "request_id": "chatcmpl-2d657b1b-b113-45fa-bff2-cc42db8a63c1", "raw_response": null}
