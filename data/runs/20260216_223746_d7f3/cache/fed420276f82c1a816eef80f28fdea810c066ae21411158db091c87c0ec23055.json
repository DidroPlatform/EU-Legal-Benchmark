The municipality wants to rezone from commercial to residential use. This is a legitimate use of a planning zone instrument. The statement that \"Die Planungszone ist zulässig\" appears to be **correct**.\n\n**Statement ii (Baugesuch von T):**\nT's property had the residential requirement increased from 50% to 90%, which was struck down by the court due to noise issues. One year later, T applies to expand his bakery (reducing residential use further), and shortly after, the city proposes a new revision increasing residential requirement to 80%. \n\nThe building authority denied T's application. The question is whether this denial is lawful. Given that:\n- The previous 90% requirement was struck down as unfeasible\n- A new 80% revision is only proposed (not yet in force)\n- T's current property must comply with the 50% requirement\n- T's expansion would reduce residential use below even 50%\n\nThe denial could be justified either on current zoning violations or based on the pending revision. However, the statement says the denial is \"rechtmässig\" (lawful). This is likely **correct** as T would be violating even the current 50% requirement.\n\n**Statement iii (Glaszimmer):**\nF wants to place mobile glass sleeping cubes outside the building zone in pristine nature. Key factors:\n- Located outside building zones\n- Visible structures with foundations (steel cables)\n- Commercial tourist use\n- Seasonal but recurring placement\n\nUnder Swiss law, even temporary structures typically require building permits, especially:\n- Outside building zones\n- For commercial purposes\n- With some form of anchoring/foundation\n- Visible impact on landscape\n\nF's view that no building permit is needed is almost certainly **incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Statement i: correct (planning zone is permissible)\n- Statement ii: correct (denial is lawful)\n- Statement iii: **false** (building permit is required)\n\nThe question asks which statements are false. Only statement iii is false.\n\n{\"answer\": \"E\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement iii is false because F's commercial glass sleeping cubes outside the building zone, despite being mobile and seasonal, require a building permit under Swiss planning law due to their commercial nature, anchoring, and landscape impact. Statements i and ii are correct.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1494, "completion_tokens": 563, "total_tokens": 2057}, "latency_s": 12.409842958004447, "request_id": "chatcmpl-25255032-ae40-4efa-b997-e3f9a018fd36", "raw_response": null}
