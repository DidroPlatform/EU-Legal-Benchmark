The Tenant Company (Potentially Primary Criminal Liability)**\n- Brought in unsafe equipment\n- Failed to ensure PAT testing\n- Breach of Section 3, HSWA 1974\n- Possible Corporate Manslaughter (if gross negligence proven)\n\n**2. You as Building Owner (Significant Liability)**\n- Failed to control tenant activities adequately\n- Inadequate fire risk assessment (your responsibility even if outsourced)\n- Possible breach of FSO 2005 Articles 8, 9, and 22\n- Possible breach of HSWA 1974 Sections 2, 3, and 4\n- **Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007** - possible if management failures were gross\n\n**3. The Fire Risk Assessment Company (Potential Professional Negligence)**\n- Civil liability for inadequate assessment\n- Less likely to face criminal charges\n- You may have a claim against them, BUT this doesn't absolve you\n\n### Corporate Manslaughter Considerations\n\nThe **Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007** requires proof that:\n- Death resulted from management failure\n- Failure was a substantial element in the death\n- Failure constituted a gross breach of duty of care\n- Senior management was substantially involved\n\n**Both companies could potentially face this charge.**\n\n---\n\n## Practical Steps to Demonstrate Compliance\n\n### Documentation You Need:\n\n1. **Fire Risk Assessment**\n   - The original assessment\n   - Evidence of implementation\n   - Review dates and updated assessments\n   - Action plans\n\n2. **Lease Agreement**\n   - Safety clauses\n   - Responsibility allocation\n   - Insurance requirements\n\n3. **Coordination Evidence**\n   - Meeting minutes with tenant\n   - Joint safety protocols\n   - Inspection records\n\n4. **Training Records**\n   - Fire warden training\n   - Staff inductions\n   - Emergency procedure training\n\n5. **Maintenance Records**\n   - Fire alarm tests\n   - Emergency lighting tests\n   - Fire extinguisher servicing\n   - Electrical installation certificates\n\n6. **Policies and Procedures**\n   - Fire safety policy\n   - Electrical safety policy\n   - Permit-to-work systems (if any)\n   - Hot work permits\n\n7. **Insurance Documentation**\n   - Employer's liability\n   - Public liability\n   - Buildings insurance\n\n---\n\n## Critical Weaknesses in Your Position\n\n### 1. **Inadequate Fire Risk Assessment**\n- Even though outsourced, you're responsible\n- Should have identified electrical risks\n- Should have addressed shared occupancy risks\n\n### 2. **Lack of Control Over Tenant Activities**\n- No mention of equipment approval processes\n- No electrical safety requirements in place\n- Insufficient coordination (Article 22, FSO 2005)\n\n### 3. **Shared Responsibility Confusion**\n- Unclear who was responsible for what\n- No evidence of joint safety management\n\n---\n\n## Regulatory Outcomes You May Face\n\n### Fire Safety Order Prosecutions\n- **Penalties:** Unlimited fines, up to 2 years imprisonment\n- **Likely charges:** Articles 8, 9, 22 breaches\n\n### Health and Safety Prosecutions\n- **Penalties:** Unlimited fines, up to 2 years imprisonment (summary), unlimited imprisonment (indictment)\n- **Sentencing Guidelines:** Based on culpability and harm\n\n### Corporate Manslaughter\n- **Penalties:** Unlimited fines (typically millions), remedial orders, publicity orders\n- **Requires:** Gross breach by senior management\n\n### Prohibition/Enforcement Notices\n- May prevent use of premises until improvements made\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations for Your Defense\n\n### 1. **Immediate Actions**\n- Secure all documentation\n- Engage specialist fire safety and H&S legal counsel immediately\n- Do NOT destroy any documents\n- Conduct internal investigation (under legal privilege)\n\n### 2. **Cooperation Strategy**\n- Cooperate fully with investigations\n- Demonstrate remorse and corrective action\n- Show what you've done since the incident\n\n### 3. **Evidence to Gather**\n- All communications with tenant about safety\n- Any inspections you conducted\n- Evidence of your own electrical safety compliance\n- Proof of fire safety equipment maintenance\n\n### 4. **Mitigation Arguments**\n- You engaged professional assessors\n- You implemented recommendations made\n- The specific risk was created by tenant\n- You had no knowledge of the unsafe equipment\n\n### 5. **Civil Claims**\n- Consider contribution claims against tenant\n- Professional negligence claim against fire risk assessors\n- Review insurance coverage\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### Your Position:\n**Legally vulnerable but not without defenses**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Commissioned professional fire risk assessment\n- Presumably maintained fire safety equipment\n- Did not directly cause the fire\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Ultimate responsibility as building owner\n- Inadequate control over tenant activities\n- Failed to ensure comprehensive risk assessment\n- Possible failure in coordination duties\n\n### Most Likely Outcome:\n- **Both companies will face charges**\n- Tenant may face more serious charges (direct causation)\n- You will likely face FSO 2005 and HSWA 1974 charges\n- Significant fines probable for both parties\n- Corporate manslaughter possible if gross negligence proven\n\n### Primary Blame:\n**Legally, blame will likely be shared:**\n- Tenant: 60-70% (brought in unsafe equipment)\n- You: 30-40% (failed in control and coordination duties)\n\nHowever, **both parties had independent legal duties** that were breached, so both can be fully prosecuted regardless of proportionate blame.\n\n---\n\n**Urgent:** Engage specialist legal counsel immediately.
