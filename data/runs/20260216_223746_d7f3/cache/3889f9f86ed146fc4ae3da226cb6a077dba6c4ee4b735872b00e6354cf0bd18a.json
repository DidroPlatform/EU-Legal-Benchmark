Driving alone after failing = illegal (like any learner).\n- **International licence/IDP**: This doesn't override UK rules if you're on a provisional. An IDP is just a translation document—you need a *valid full foreign licence* behind it. If you're a visitor (not UK resident), you can drive on a full foreign licence + IDP for up to 12 months without a UK test. But if you're taking a UK practical (e.g., as a resident or post-12 months), police treat you as a provisional holder.\n\n### What Happens if Police Pull You Over?\n- **Not instant arrest**: Unlikely unless you're speeding, no insurance, or dangerous driving. They'd check your licence status via computer.\n- **Penalties**:\n  | Offense | Fine | Points | Other |\n  |---------|------|--------|-------|\n  | Driving unsupervised on provisional | Up to £1,000 | 3–6 | Vehicle seized if no insurance/L plates |\n  | No valid licence at all | Up to £1,000+ | 3–6 | Court summons possible |\n- Worst case: Towed car, court later. No licence = no insurance validity.\n\n### What to Do Instead (Safest):\n- **Don't risk it**. Call a friend/family for a lift, taxi/Uber (~£20-30 from Crewe), or bus/train (Crewe station nearby).\n- Book retest ASAP (slots filling fast).\n- If your foreign licence is truly full/valid for UK driving, confirm with DVSA helpline (0300 790 6801) before driving.\n\nStay safe—better safe than points/fine!
