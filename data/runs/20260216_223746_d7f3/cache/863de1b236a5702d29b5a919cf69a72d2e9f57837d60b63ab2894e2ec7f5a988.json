The candidate answer discusses the burden of proof for goods being 'at risk' and mentions that traders must declare intent, and if there is doubt, goods are treated as 'at risk.' It notes that the 'at risk' determination is ongoing and contested, but it does not explicitly state that the specific difficulty regarding raw materials/components that are subsequently processed into EU-bound products remains unresolved by the Framework or subsequent instruments. It addresses the general 'at risk' determination but fails to pinpoint this specific, unresolved complexity related to supply chains/processing.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4415a72c-e330-4316-a7cb-27df04119e0a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1735, "completion_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 1941}, "latency_s": 0.997252082976047, "request_id": "r-KUacODE7n2vdIP0t_ZqAM", "raw_response": null}
