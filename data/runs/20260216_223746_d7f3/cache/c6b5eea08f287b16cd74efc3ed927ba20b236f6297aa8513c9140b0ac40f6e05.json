It also mentions the European Commission's infringement proceedings (Article 258 TFEU). However, it never explicitly mentions or outlines the 'state liability framework' (which typically refers to the mechanism under Article 340 TFEU allowing individuals to sue the state for damages caused by a breach of EU law, often following a CJEU ruling).
