This is the most methodologically complete and formally correct continuation, reflecting the Court's typical admissibility analysis language. Options A and D are similar but less precise in their reasoning structure, and Option C goes in a different direction by proceeding to examine the merits rather than rejecting the complaint.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 401, "completion_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 579}, "latency_s": 6.898241958027938, "request_id": "chatcmpl-6a84ec2a-d0c9-4ec8-9a8b-5607b9aaddbc", "raw_response": null}
