The candidate answer discusses the occupier's rights based on their status (tenant vs. licensee) and the relevant legislation (Rent Act 1977, Housing Act 1988) but fails to explicitly address the legal implication of the sale (the disposition) on the existing rights, specifically whether the rights must have existed at the moment the buyer acquired the property. The answer focuses on what happens *after* the sale regarding eviction procedures, not the status *at the time* of the sale.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b1d17dc7-cd11-411d-88af-47cab931fcfe\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2019, "completion_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 2205}, "latency_s": 0.7610404159640893, "request_id": "2fSUafDHF9_x7M8P1Ouu-QQ", "raw_response": null}
