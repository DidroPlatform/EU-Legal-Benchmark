HMRC will look through it to the LP's direct involvement in the licensing arrangement. The question isn't \"does the CV have a PE\" but \"does the LP have a PE in the Netherlands or Singapore?\"\n\n**UK PE in Netherlands (unlikely but check):**\n- A passive licensing arrangement routed through a Dutch entity *normally* won't create a PE\n- But if the LP has dependent agents in NL with authority to conclude/negotiate licenses, you have a problem\n- If the CV is just a conduit with no real decision-making, you're fine\n\n**Singapore PE (the real exposure):**\n- If the LP is deemed to have a fixed place of business in Singapore (office, equipment, personnel making licensing decisions), you have a PE\n- More likely: if the Singaporean licensee acts as a dependent agent with authority to conclude licenses on the LP's behalf, that's a PE under Article 5(e) of most treaties\n- **This kills the treaty benefit entirely**—royalties become business profits taxable in Singapore at full rates\n\n## Treaty Benefit Holding Up\n\n**The NL-SG treaty (Article 12) caps royalties at 5% if:**\n1. The beneficial owner is a resident of one contracting state\n2. The royalties arise in the other contracting state\n3. No anti-abuse provisions are triggered\n\n**Your vulnerability:**\n\n- **HMRC challenge**: HMRC may argue the LP doesn't qualify as beneficial owner because the arrangement is a treaty-shopping structure. The UK-NL treaty (Article 12) also caps at 5%, so there's no rate arbitrage to justify the routing. HMRC can invoke the principal purpose test (PPT) under MLI if both countries are signatories (they are). If PPT applies, treaty benefits are denied.\n\n- **Singapore challenge**: Singapore's tax authority may deny treaty benefits if they view this as artificial. Singapore has been increasingly aggressive on substance-over-form.\n\n- **Dependent agent PE**: If Singapore finds a dependent agent PE exists, the treaty doesn't apply to those profits at all—they're taxed as business profits.\n\n## Cut to the Chase\n\n**Do not proceed without:**\n\n1. **Substance in the Netherlands**: The CV must have real employees, decision-making authority, and genuine commercial functions. A bare conduit fails PPT scrutiny and creates reputational risk with both HMRC and Singapore IRB.\n\n2. **Dependent agent analysis**: Get written confirmation from the Singaporean licensee that they have **no authority** to conclude, negotiate, or modify licenses on the LP's behalf. If they do, you have a PE and the treaty collapses.\n\n3. **PPT assessment**: Document the commercial rationale for the Dutch routing *independent* of tax savings. If it's purely tax-driven, PPT will apply post-MLI, and HMRC will deny treaty benefits.\n\n4. **Fallback position**: Model the deal assuming:\n   - No treaty benefit (full UK + Singapore withholding)\n   - UK tax on worldwide royalties (LP is UK resident)\n   - Singapore corporate tax on any profits retained in the CV\n\n**Bottom line**: The CV structure is defensible *only if* there's genuine commercial substance in the Netherlands and no dependent agent PE in Singapore. If either fails, you're paying full freight in both jurisdictions plus facing penalties. The treaty benefit is fragile under PPT.\n\n**Recommendation**: Before proceeding, get a ruling from Singapore IRB confirming no dependent agent PE, and document the NL substance contemporaneously. Otherwise, the complexity cost exceeds the tax savings.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 89, "completion_tokens": 855, "total_tokens": 944}, "latency_s": 10.419926000002306, "request_id": "chatcmpl-cd2f5afa-0191-46e5-a99d-2060947da9f1", "raw_response": null}
