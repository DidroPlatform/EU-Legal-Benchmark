While it doesn't explicitly state 'there are no facts indicating a valid breach,' it frames the entire defense around the *lack* of a valid breach by the client, which satisfies the intent of the criterion by focusing the strategy on the distributor's wrongful termination based on the facts provided (client thinks they just found a cheaper product).\", \"criterion_id\": \"d5afc437-3642-4325-9116-c899\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3865, "completion_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 4057}, "latency_s": 1.0601158749777824, "request_id": "3_-UabL0HOjpnsEP173biQg", "raw_response": null}
