Statement ii is incorrect - Swiss civil procedure does not apply such a broad res judicata concept; findings of fact and legal assessments are not automatically binding across all subsequent disputes between parties. Statement iii is incorrect - Swiss contract law recognizes that when both parties' interpretations are equally admissible, a contract can still exist and be interpreted according to good faith principles (not requiring perfect consensus). Statement iv is correct - the 2nd parentel in Swiss succession law includes parents and their descendants. Therefore, statements ii and iii are incorrect.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens": 166, "total_tokens": 506}, "latency_s": 2.3565347919939086, "request_id": "chatcmpl-3e878671-b4eb-40e1-9f90-58f23a263195", "raw_response": null}
