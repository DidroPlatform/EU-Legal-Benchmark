This directly satisfies the criterion requiring the response to state that one way to justify these provisions is to state that these provisions will allow for more investment (by being more attractive to shareholders).\", \"criterion_id\": \"fa7b8a5e-8a63-4c8c-940c-8e85d5cb4392\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2662, "completion_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 2840}, "latency_s": 0.8346095000160858, "request_id": "qt2UafLxBLPUvdIP-4jzoQE", "raw_response": null}
