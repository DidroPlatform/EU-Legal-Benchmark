The candidate answer discusses Subpart F income (Section 954) and GILTI (Section 951A) separately and in relation to each other (e.g., interest income being Subpart F income or tested income under GILTI, and the look-through rule of Section 954(c)(6) excluding income from Subpart F if it's not Subpart F income). However, it does not explicitly state the core relationship required by the criterion: that GILTI's tested income definition *excludes* Subpart F income, which is the key mechanism determining which regime applies to a specific item of income. The discussion implies this relationship but fails to state the explicit exclusion rule central to the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f9ecd0f0-4a16-43f1-a9bf-1ac20638d5f4\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4361, "completion_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 4602}, "latency_s": 0.9503643329953775, "request_id": "z8WUacndOrWVnsEPl_iniQI", "raw_response": null}
