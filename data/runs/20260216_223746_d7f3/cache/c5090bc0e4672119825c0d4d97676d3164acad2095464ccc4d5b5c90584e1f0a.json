It follows a logical pattern where the Court examines whether the applicant properly raised the specific complaint (Article 14/discrimination) before domestic courts before bringing it to the ECHR. This is a standard preliminary objection analysis under Article 35 § 1, noting the applicant's failure to raise the issue domestically and questioning whether exhaustion requirements are met. The other options either conclude a different type of analysis (A - manifestly ill-founded), are too generic/fragmentary (C), or address the opposite situation where the Government bears the burden regarding remedy availability (D).\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 378, "completion_tokens": 165, "total_tokens": 543}, "latency_s": 5.232429124996997, "request_id": "chatcmpl-67820ee5-d13d-4bda-80b9-96bc73dded32", "raw_response": null}
