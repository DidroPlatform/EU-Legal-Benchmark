The response discusses environmental law counterclaims (which relate to sustainable development/ESG) and mentions investor obligations in modern treaties (e.g., 2016 Morocco-Nigeria BIT, 2020 Netherlands Model BIT) as a basis for treaty-based counterclaims. However, it does not explicitly frame this as the 'trend toward including sustainable development or ESG standards in investment arbitration' as a general public policy integration trend affecting admissibility, but rather as specific treaty provisions that might grant jurisdiction. Therefore, the specific concept requested by the criterion is not clearly or explicitly mentioned.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ccf5b4c5-d6fe-4e7a-873c-6ea7bec9e78a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2598, "completion_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 2788}, "latency_s": 1.5875012079777662, "request_id": "8s-UaajdKOLUkdUPgcXX-A4", "raw_response": null}
