The candidate answer explicitly states in Section 1 that the GIP is a 'personne morale de droit public' (legal entity under public law) based on the CGCT (Code général des collectivités territoriales). While the answer correctly discusses the possibility of using private law contracts for certain functions, it fundamentally misrepresents the general legal status of the GIP itself, which is defined as a public law entity by statute, not generally as a private law entity unless specified otherwise. The premise of the criterion is inverted in the candidate's initial legal framework.\", \"criterion_id\": \"64736b28-433e-4cbd-94b6-3c1e34014b88\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4214, "completion_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 4401}, "latency_s": 1.3097397499950603, "request_id": "w-SUad6AONXcvdIPlpOxoAM", "raw_response": null}
