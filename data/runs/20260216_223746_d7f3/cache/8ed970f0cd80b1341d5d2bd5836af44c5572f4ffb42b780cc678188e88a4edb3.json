The candidate answer explicitly discusses the UK context (mentioning HMRC) and focuses its analysis on the strategic trade-off between criminal/tax liability and civil liability (wrongful death lawsuits). It does not mention or apply any specific U.S. punitive damages ratio limits or arbitrary caps, instead focusing on the legal implications of admitting negligence in a civil context under UK principles.
