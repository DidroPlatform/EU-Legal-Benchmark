Your protections depend on several factors:\n\n## Key Issues to Establish\n\n**1. Your Legal Status in the Property**\n- Were you ever on a tenancy agreement (even informal)?\n- Did you pay rent at any point, or was it always free?\n- How did the original arrangement begin?\n\n**2. Potential Protections You May Have**\n\nEven without paying rent, you might have rights as:\n- A **licensee** (if you had permission to occupy)\n- A **tenant** (if the arrangement had tenancy characteristics, despite no rent)\n- Someone with **adverse possession** rights (after 10 years of occupation, though this is complex)\n\n**3. Notice Requirements**\n- The new owner likely cannot simply evict you without proper legal process\n- They must give you reasonable notice (typically 2-4 weeks minimum for a licensee, longer for a tenant)\n- They cannot use self-help eviction (changing locks, removing belongings)\n\n## What You Should Do Now\n\n1. **Get legal advice urgently** — contact:\n   - Citizens Advice\n   - Shelter (housing charity)\n   - A solicitor specializing in housing law\n\n2. **Document everything** — gather evidence of your 10-year occupation\n\n3. **Don't leave voluntarily** without understanding your rights\n\n4. **Respond to the new owner** in writing (not verbally)\n\n## Important Caveat\n\nYour position is stronger than it might initially appear, but the specifics matter greatly. **Seek professional legal advice immediately** — many housing charities offer free consultations.\n\nWhat was your original arrangement with the previous landlord?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 159, "completion_tokens": 377, "total_tokens": 536}, "latency_s": 4.61989583299146, "request_id": "chatcmpl-56778a4f-b45f-4d97-b5e3-76d449aa163d", "raw_response": null}
