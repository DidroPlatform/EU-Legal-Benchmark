The candidate answer discusses when a UK PE *could* arise for the LP due to UK management/contracting (Section 1, 'When a UK PE issue could arise'), but it does not frame this as a mechanism to *avoid* issues by having UK management. In fact, it suggests UK management/control undermines the 'NL resident beneficial owner' narrative (Section 4, Q5). The core analysis focuses on the low UK PE risk for the LP from the CV itself, and the high risk to the NL-SG treaty benefit, which is independent of UK management location.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e1522b6a-f03f-477e-acad-a08fa97db3b2\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1779, "completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 1981}, "latency_s": 0.780962124990765, "request_id": "1RSVaebkIuGlxN8Ppv3riAo", "raw_response": null}
