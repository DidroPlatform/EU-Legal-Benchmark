The candidate answer discusses strategy, jurisdiction, and remedies generally (e.g., wrongful termination counterclaim, challenging loss models) but fails to explicitly list or confirm entitlement to the three specific categories of damages mentioned in the criterion (lost profits, reliance costs, costs to find a new distributor) as potential recovery for the client due to the German distributor's early termination breach.
