It correctly identifies the specific challenges related to the US parent company's control and the corruption risk in India. The structure is logical, and the legal references (e.g., Art. 28 GDPR, Art. 9 GDPR, FCPA, UKBA, DPDPA 2023) are accurate and relevant. The analysis of the Indian context, including the new DPDPA, adds significant value beyond the reference answer. The only minor deviation is the reference answer mentioning IaaS/PaaS/SaaS models, which the candidate implicitly covers under the general cloud outsourcing discussion but does not explicitly detail the service models. This is a minor omission given the depth of the other analyses. The candidate answer is superior in its depth and contemporary relevance (mentioning DPDPA 2023).\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.95}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3452, "completion_tokens": 266, "total_tokens": 3718}, "latency_s": 1.1414736659789924, "request_id": "scaUaeC8C5S8nsEPnPGoiQ8", "raw_response": null}
