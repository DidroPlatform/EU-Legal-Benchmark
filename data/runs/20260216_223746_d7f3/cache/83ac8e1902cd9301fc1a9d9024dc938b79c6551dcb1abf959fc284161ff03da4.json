Here are the key issues:\n\n## Your Tenancy Status\n\n**Critical problem**: You mention \"not paying rent\" - this significantly weakens your position. To have legal protection as a tenant in the UK, you typically need:\n- A tenancy agreement (written or verbal)\n- Payment of rent (even nominal amounts)\n- Evidence of a landlord-tenant relationship\n\n**If you're an \"excluded occupier\" or licensee** (living rent-free by arrangement), you have **very limited legal rights** and can typically be asked to leave with reasonable notice.\n\n## The 10-Year Occupancy Factor\n\n- Long-term occupancy *could* establish some rights, but **only if you were a legitimate tenant**\n- Squatters' rights (adverse possession) don't apply to residential property in England & Wales since 2012\n\n## Your Ignored Communication\n\n**This was a mistake**. When you:\n- Ignored the buyer's question about occupancy\n- Allowed the sale to proceed without clarifying your status\n- The buyer may argue you misrepresented the situation\n\n## What You Should Do NOW\n\n1. **Seek immediate legal advice** from a solicitor specializing in housing law or contact **Shelter** (shelter.org.uk / 0808 800 4444)\n\n2. **Gather evidence** of your arrangement with the previous landlord\n\n3. **Respond to the new owner** - don't continue ignoring communications\n\n4. **Don't leave immediately** without understanding your rights, but be prepared that you may have limited protection\n\n## Realistic Assessment\n\nWithout paying rent and with no formal tenancy agreement, **you likely have minimal legal protection** and may need to vacate with reasonable notice (possibly as little as reasonable time to find alternative accommodation).\n\n**Get professional legal advice urgently.**", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 159, "completion_tokens": 414, "total_tokens": 573}, "latency_s": 9.759070208005141, "request_id": "chatcmpl-82ef0ee6-070d-41a6-8ee9-ed880c3df042", "raw_response": null}
