The candidate answer mentions 'ESG' in the 'Overall Trends and Recommendations' section, stating: 'Trend favors admission for 'legitimate' state defenses (e.g., ESG), but declines unrelated claims.' While it mentions ESG, it does so only in the context of justifying the admission of legitimate state defenses, rather than explicitly discussing the broader trend of integrating sustainable development or ESG standards into the substantive or jurisdictional framework of investment arbitration as a general trend influencing admissibility. It is a passing mention, but not a detailed discussion of the integration trend itself.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ccf5b4c5-d6fe-4e7a-873c-6ea7bec9e78a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2208, "completion_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 2392}, "latency_s": 1.4362612499971874, "request_id": "hSuVab3GFcyynsEPyd_uiAQ", "raw_response": null}
