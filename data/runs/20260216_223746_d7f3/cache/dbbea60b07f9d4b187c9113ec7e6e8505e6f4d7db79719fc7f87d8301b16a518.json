The candidate answer explicitly states the opposite of the error described in the criterion: \\\"Even if you establish you have a beneficial interest (constructive trust / proprietary estoppel), **a registered legal charge typically has priority over later or unprotected equitable interests**.\\\" The candidate correctly identifies that the lender's charge often has priority and that the claimant's interest must be overriding or the charge must be set aside/postponed to gain priority. Therefore, the response does *not* satisfy the condition for failing (i.e., it does not incorrectly advise that the constructive trust automatically has priority).\", \"criterion_id\": \"efe892e8-3336-4d58-afc7-6400db760a08\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2487, "completion_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 2702}, "latency_s": 1.349117291974835, "request_id": "BBmVabOmBr7zxs0PkPG1-Qs", "raw_response": null}
