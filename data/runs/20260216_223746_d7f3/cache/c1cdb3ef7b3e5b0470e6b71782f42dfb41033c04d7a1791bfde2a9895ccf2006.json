The candidate response mentions UK disclosure rules under 'Discovery Conflicts and Sanctions' stating: 'UK: CPR 31 limits disclosure to documents relied upon or adverse; US-style discovery unavailable'. While CPR 31 governs disclosure, and proportionality is a key principle within the CPR (specifically CPR 31.7 and the overriding objective in CPR 1.1), the response does not explicitly state 'proportional pre-trial discovery' as the rule, but rather describes the *limitation* of UK disclosure compared to US discovery. It mentions CPR 31, which is the correct area, but fails to explicitly confirm the proportionality aspect as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"92b58255-0bf8-4690-99a4-55e9abe78dd9\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4282, "completion_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 4487}, "latency_s": 0.9417760419892147, "request_id": "RsqUaYrwLMewnsEPm4ag0QM", "raw_response": null}
