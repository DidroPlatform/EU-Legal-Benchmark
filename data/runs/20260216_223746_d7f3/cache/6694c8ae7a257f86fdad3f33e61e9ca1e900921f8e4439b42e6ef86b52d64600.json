The candidate answer concludes that the review board will likely find that Spain's refusal to cooperate does not constitute a violation due to the reservation (point 2 in Section VIII), which is a significant win for Spain regarding the specific charge of non-cooperation. However, the answer also concludes that the review board will likely find that Spain committed the initial violation (unmarked lines, point 1 in Section VIII) and that Spain remains obligated to investigate and act on the report (point 4 in Section VIII). Since the review board will likely find Spain in violation of the substantive marking obligation (Article 5/Annex IV), it cannot be said that the board will 'likely side with Spain' entirely, as Spain is found liable for the initial infraction. Siding with Spain implies a favorable outcome overall, which is not the case here as the substantive violation remains.\", \"criterion_id\": \"criterion 8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2323, "completion_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 2532}, "latency_s": 0.9473187499970663, "request_id": "jcaUab35Ob3ukdUPjeSHsAM", "raw_response": null}
