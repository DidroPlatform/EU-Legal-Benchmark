The candidate answer discusses this shirt under the heading '2. Worker's rights advocate version' and concludes it is 'Potentially infringement, but parody defense possible.' It cites Article 18 (which covers moral rights, including integrity) but frames the analysis around whether the parody defense applies, rather than explicitly stating it is a violation of the right of integrity. While the right of integrity is implicated when unauthorized modifications are made, the response focuses on the defense (parody) rather than confirming the violation under the specific right mentioned in the criterion (integrity). It does not explicitly link the modification to the right of integrity as the primary basis for violation, instead focusing on general infringement and parody exceptions.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a87ee2ed-7a89-48f0-9c97-02ca08e4b193\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1751, "completion_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 1982}, "latency_s": 1.8039209590060636, "request_id": "v9SUacPJDuOXkdUPwKDLyAM", "raw_response": null}
