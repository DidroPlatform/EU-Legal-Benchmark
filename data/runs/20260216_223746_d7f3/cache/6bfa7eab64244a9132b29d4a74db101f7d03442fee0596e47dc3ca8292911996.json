The candidate answer discusses civil exposure in the context of wrongful death suits and mentions 'Multipliers on \\u00a35-20M claims \\u2192 \\u00a350-200M judgments,' which implies the application of multipliers, a concept often associated with punitive damages in the US system, although the UK system does allow for damages beyond mere compensation in certain torts (like aggravated or exemplary damages, though the latter is rare). Crucially, the response does not explicitly state or rely on a 'U.S.-style punitive damages ratio limit (e.g., a single-digit multiplier of compensatory damages)' as the basis for its calculation or advice. It uses multipliers as a general risk assessment term for high civil liability, which is not a direct application or misapplication of the specific US ratio limit mentioned in the criterion. The advice is focused on UK context (HMRC, administration, CVA) and the core trade-off, not on applying a specific US damages cap.\", \"criterion_id\": \"42abff97-5213-4dd4-af7d-f21aac1cdd89\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2117, "completion_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 2403}, "latency_s": 1.39960229099961, "request_id": "CCuVabnOGeTQnsEPhvGb-Ag", "raw_response": null}
