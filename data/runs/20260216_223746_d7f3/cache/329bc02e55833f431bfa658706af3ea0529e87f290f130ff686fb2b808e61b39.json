{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 0, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion explicitly tests for recognition of the correct statute for *physical books*. The candidate answer correctly identifies the French Intellectual Property Code (CPI), specifically Articles L.132-1 to L.132-17, which regulate publishing contracts (*contrats d'édition*). However, the user's context specifies the publisher publishes *exclusively online* (e-book/digital). While the answer mentions digital nuances, the core legal framework cited (CPI L.132-x) governs publishing contracts generally, which applies to both print and digital in France. The criterion demands recognition of the statute for *physical books*. Since the context is digital, and the answer cites the general publishing contract law which covers both, it does not strictly meet the narrow requirement of identifying the statute *for physical books* as distinct from digital ones, although the cited law is the correct foundation for publishing contracts in general in France. Given the strict nature of the atomic criterion, and the context being digital, the recognition of the statute *for physical books* is not clearly demonstrated or is irrelevant to the user's specific situation, leading to a failure to meet the precise requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c2bdc5f7-9767-4b95-a5d5-0b43115866d1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1781, "completion_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 2073}, "latency_s": 1.1591859579784796, "request_id": "8SOVaZWdBryK7M8PiJiNuAM", "raw_response": null}
