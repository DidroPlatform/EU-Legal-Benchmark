This concept of shared liability based on fault percentages (often associated with civil/tort law apportionment) is not the primary mechanism for determining criminal liability in the UK, where causation is generally a binary question (did the defendant cause the harm, or did an intervening act break the chain?). The candidate correctly analyzes that the truck driver's negligence would likely *not* break the chain, meaning the drunk driver would likely bear full criminal liability for the resulting injury under the relevant criminal statutes (like s.1A RTA 1988). The response does not discuss or suggest shared criminal liability or apportionment of fault via percentages, which is what the criterion specifically demands.\", \"criterion_id\": \"dda864ac-b922-4cbc-89f6-414a89bd03ed\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2059, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 2288}, "latency_s": 0.8340275000082329, "request_id": "FP-UaYS7KueGkdUPsqK74AQ", "raw_response": null}
