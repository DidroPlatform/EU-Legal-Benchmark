The candidate answer cites *R v Palmer* [1971] AC 814, which is a decision of the Privy Council (an appeal from the Bahamas) but was reported in the All England Law Reports (All ER) and is often cited in English law discussions, though its binding nature in the UK context compared to domestic UK Supreme Court/Court of Appeal cases can be nuanced. Crucially, the candidate answer *does not* advise the solicitor that *Palmer* or *Beckford* (which was not even mentioned) are not binding domestic UK precedent. Instead, it treats *Palmer* as relevant case law supporting the proposition regarding mistaken belief. Therefore, the specific instruction in the criterion was not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"bbfa06d0-1d7b-41af-bb76-fa659eee9bd5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1424, "completion_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 1655}, "latency_s": 4.321918791974895, "request_id": "LwaVaaqdB_jHnsEP9ouZ4Qg", "raw_response": null}
