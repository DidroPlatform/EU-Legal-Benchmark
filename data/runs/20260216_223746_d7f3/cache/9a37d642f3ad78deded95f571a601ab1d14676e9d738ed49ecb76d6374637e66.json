The candidate answer explicitly addresses this by detailing the Windsor Framework's 'green/red lane' system. It states the green lane is for goods staying in NI/UK (minimal checks) and the red lane is for goods destined for Ireland/EU (full EU checks), which directly implements the concept of differentiating treatment based on the risk of onward movement into the EU single market. It also correctly identifies the shift in the burden of proof under the WF, where goods are now presumed NOT at risk unless there are reasonable grounds to suspect diversion, contrasting this with the previous Protocol rules.\", \"criterion_id\": \"180fd671-ce28-4f9a-a704-b66b61a7b661\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2733, "completion_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 2940}, "latency_s": 1.4421876249834895, "request_id": "tjOVafmNCqrw7M8P4OXQkQk", "raw_response": null}
