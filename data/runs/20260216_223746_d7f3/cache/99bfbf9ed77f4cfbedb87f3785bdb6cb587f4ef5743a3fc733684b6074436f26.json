The candidate answer addresses this under 'Seat of arbitration considerations' by stating: 'Section 2(3) of the Arbitration Act 1996 extends certain court powers (including s.44) to arbitrations seated outside England, but the court retains a **discretion** about whether to exercise those powers. The court will consider: ... Whether it is appropriate for the English court to act given the foreign seat'. This explicitly covers the concept that the foreign seat influences the court's discretion to refuse to act if deemed inappropriate.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f319b040-3157-48dd-bb9f-24ca01953844\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2267, "completion_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 2462}, "latency_s": 0.7455327500065323, "request_id": "Pr2Uac-vA8GknsEPzKbYmAI", "raw_response": null}
