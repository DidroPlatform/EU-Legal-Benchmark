However, it does not explicitly state that data collected without valid consent (or a proper legal basis) *must* be deleted. It suggests setting a retention rule, which is related but not the same as mandating deletion due to lack of consent.\", \"criterion_id\": \"bef281c1-a097-4fe4-a4b5-3d7adc42596d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1262, "completion_tokens": 158, "total_tokens": 1420}, "latency_s": 0.6883479169919156, "request_id": "PhWVaYLkHJuZ28oPh4-usAQ", "raw_response": null}
