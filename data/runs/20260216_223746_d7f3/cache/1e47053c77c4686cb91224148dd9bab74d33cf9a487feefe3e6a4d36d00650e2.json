Furthermore, the facts state the client struck the victim *after* the victim attacked him, meaning the client is claiming self-defence against the victim's initial attack, not that the client's initial action was minor and the victim's retaliation was disproportionate. The response discusses proportionality generally (Palmer, Owino, s.76(6)) but fails to address the specific legal point raised by the criterion (R v Keane).\", \"criterion_id\": \"653cb3de-b54e-4fad-a0f4-e0a95a9f150d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2754, "completion_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 2959}, "latency_s": 0.7502830000012182, "request_id": "tRaVaaOWINqb28oPgemZoQg", "raw_response": null}
