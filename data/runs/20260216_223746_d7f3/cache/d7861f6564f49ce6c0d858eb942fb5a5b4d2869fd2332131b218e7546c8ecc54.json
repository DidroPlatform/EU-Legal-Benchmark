The candidate answer states under section 2, 'Issue a Fixed-Penalty Notice (FPN)' that the outcome is a 'f\\u00edne + 3 penalty points on your licence' (which is \\u00a3100 fine). While the response mentions a \\u00a3100 fine and 3 points, not the maximum \\u00a31000 fine and 6 points mentioned in the criterion, it clearly mentions the possibility of a fine and penalty points for driving as a learner without supervision, which satisfies the core requirement of mentioning the potential penalty (fine and points). The specific values mentioned in the criterion (\\u00a31000/6 points) are the maximums that *could* be imposed by a court, whereas the FPN is \\u00a3100/3 points. Since the response details the likely FPN outcome (\\u00a3100/3 points) and also mentions court summons for more serious cases, it covers the essence of the penalty structure for this offence.\", \"criterion_id\": \"6b6b453b-5843-4c62-a123-a490d04247f8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2826, "completion_tokens": 330, "total_tokens": 3156}, "latency_s": 1.3792272910359316, "request_id": "yOaUaePrFqeX28oP-fn96AU", "raw_response": null}
