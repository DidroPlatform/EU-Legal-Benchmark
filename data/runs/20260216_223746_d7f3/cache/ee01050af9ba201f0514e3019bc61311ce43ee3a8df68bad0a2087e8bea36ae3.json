It analyzes the impact of the post-Brexit status on UK courts regarding *lis pendens* (contrasting with the former Brussels I Recast rules) and the application of common law *forum non conveniens*. It explicitly discusses the risk of parallel proceedings between the UK, Germany (mentioning § 261 ZPO and the inapplicability of Brussels I Recast to the UK), and California. Furthermore, it details significant procedural risks arising from evidence gathering, specifically citing the conflict between broad US/California discovery (FRCP Rule 26/CCP § 2017.010) and data protection constraints in the UK (UK GDPR/DPA 2018) and Germany (BDSG), and referencing the Hague Evidence Convention. It also touches upon the risk of inconsistent judgments and enforcement challenges, which are inherent to cross-border litigation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b334b6cf-6a8a-4036-91d3-5dc65bb28b02\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4316, "completion_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 4562}, "latency_s": 1.282517833984457, "request_id": "vkqUab3qLI3ZvdIPlMefqQ8", "raw_response": null}
