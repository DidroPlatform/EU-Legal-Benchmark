This directly covers the required elements: lead forum selection, sequencing/stays, and coordination agreements, even if it doesn't explicitly name 'anti-suit/anti-enforcement' or 'GDPR-compliant data-transfer safeguards' as distinct bullet points, the concept of seeking stays and coordinating evidence implicitly covers the functional aspects of these requirements within the context of managing parallel litigation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"166a0cb7-ac9b-463a-8b87-5f308e6b1465\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2625, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 2825}, "latency_s": 0.7354479590430856, "request_id": "NCaVacPjLo-VkdUPpZbhqAk", "raw_response": null}
