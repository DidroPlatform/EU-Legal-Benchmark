The candidate answer provides general strategic advice on negotiating with tax authorities and assessing legal risks related to civil lawsuits. It does not discuss or apply any specific damages calculation principles (like punitive vs. compensatory damages or caps) for the civil wrongful death lawsuits, thus it neither correctly applies nor incorrectly applies the UK principle mentioned in the criterion.
