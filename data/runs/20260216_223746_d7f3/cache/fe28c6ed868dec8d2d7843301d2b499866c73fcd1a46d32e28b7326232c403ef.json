The candidate answer explicitly advises *against* the UK retailer acting as IOR because their new US owners are refusing, and instead proposes setting up a UK Subsidiary to act as the IOR to insulate the French parent. While the answer discusses the retailer's *potential* role (Option 2 in Section 5), it frames this as a contractual change the retailer is likely to refuse, concluding that the UK Subsidiary is the necessary structural solution. Therefore, it does not state that the UK retailer *can* act as IOR in the current context; rather, it states they *must* be replaced by a subsidiary to solve the liability issue.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b95ec896-bf99-44a0-bde1-07de5ee914e5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2802, "completion_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 3007}, "latency_s": 1.002900249994127, "request_id": "Y9qUaaPXNe2zxN8PkPSmkQQ", "raw_response": null}
