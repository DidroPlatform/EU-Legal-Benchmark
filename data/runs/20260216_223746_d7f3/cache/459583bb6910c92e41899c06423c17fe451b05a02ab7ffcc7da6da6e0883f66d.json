The candidate answer analyzes the jurisdictional issues and develops a strategy based on the *assumption* that the client might have a defense (pretextual motive, material breach requirement under Delaware law). However, the prompt only states the German firm *terminated* claiming vulnerabilities and the client *thinks* the Germans found a cheaper product. The response does not affirmatively state or conclude that the facts presented *do not indicate* a valid breach by the client. Instead, it focuses on how to *defend* against the termination claim by arguing the termination was wrongful (i.e., the client did *not* breach). The analysis is strategic, not a definitive factual finding regarding the client's breach status based on the limited facts provided.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d5afc437-3642-4325-9116-c899\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2061, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 2275}, "latency_s": 1.2417953750118613, "request_id": "DDKVafvKOa7pnsEP2M6v6QU", "raw_response": null}
