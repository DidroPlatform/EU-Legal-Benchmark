The response discusses the general self-defence test under s. 3 CLA 1967 and common law, which applies to street altercations, and correctly focuses on the 'reasonable force' test, implicitly excluding the 'grossly disproportionate' test reserved for householder cases under s. 76(5A) Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. While it does not explicitly name s. 76(5A) and state it is inapplicable, the entire analysis is correctly framed around the general self-defence principles applicable to non-householder cases (Owino, Martin, Beckford), thereby satisfying the intent of the criterion by correctly omitting the householder standard.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2f43efa2-6cd5-48c6-b8fd-1035de7d7d10\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3234, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 3463}, "latency_s": 0.9160686249961145, "request_id": "reeUaaCbOefpvdIPz7jXkA8", "raw_response": null}
