The candidate answer mentions the renewal frequency for the EUTM: \\\"Single renewal every 10 years (~€850)\\\" under the Pros/Cons table, and later mentions renewals generally: \\\"Renewals: Every 10 years (EU/US/UK)\\\". While it states the renewal frequency (every 10 years) and that it is single (centralized), it does not explicitly state the concept that the EUTM has a *single renewal date* for all member states, which is a key feature distinguishing it from national marks that have individual renewal dates. The response implies centralization but doesn't use the specific phrasing or concept required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d177d9b4-45d7-4784-99b7-0f448ba13f54\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2106, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 2316}, "latency_s": 81.9028719170019, "request_id": "-TCVabzDL-K9xN8P27PqsQw", "raw_response": null}
