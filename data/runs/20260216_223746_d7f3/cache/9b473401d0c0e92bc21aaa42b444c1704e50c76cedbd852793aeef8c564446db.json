The candidate answer mentions the infringement procedure (which often leads to an Art. 258 TFEU action, not explicitly Art. 260, which deals with failure to comply with a CJEU judgment) and refers to the European Commission taking Luxembourg to the CJEU (Section 3). It also mentions filing a case before the CJEU under Article 263 TFEU (Section 4). However, the answer *never* mentions or describes the specific three-stage process (pilot, administrative, judicial) associated with the Article 260 TFEU procedure for non-compliance with EU law. Therefore, the criterion is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"218d9e7e-3fa9-48a1-9d74-def46b24ea99\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2163, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 2379}, "latency_s": 0.9539429580327123, "request_id": "nfSUadm0I-KAkdUPiI2EmQs", "raw_response": null}
