The candidate response strongly advises against taking the deal as offered and proposes a 'Third Way' (restructuring cooperation). While it does compare the potential outcomes (tax liability vs. civil annihilation), it does not perform a structured expected-value calculation comparing the financial outcomes of the two primary choices (Accept Deal vs. Fight Tax Authority) using the specified variables (tax, penalties, civil exposure, costs, timing) as inputs for a quantitative or qualitative expected-value assessment. It offers a qualitative judgment that fighting the tax case is better than certain civil annihilation if the deal requires admitting negligence, but it fails to execute the required comparative weighing based on expected value across all listed factors.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a50cf50a-2f7b-4ef0-94de-69b49708857d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2047, "completion_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 2272}, "latency_s": 1.0342920840193983, "request_id": "hM-UaY32BrGqnsEPso7fsQU", "raw_response": null}
