The candidate answer focuses entirely on jurisdictional strategy, forum selection, and merits arguments, implicitly assuming the arbitration clause is valid and enforceable. It discusses how to defend against challenges to jurisdiction (e.g., by arguing all claims are arbitrable, or by seeking anti-suit relief in England) but does not explicitly list or analyze potential grounds for invalidity (fraud, duress, incapacity) as required by the criterion. However, in the context of a strategy memo where the immediate goal is to enforce the clause, the response proceeds on the assumption that the clause is valid, which is the practical implication of finding no grounds to void it. Since the response does not analyze or mention grounds for invalidity, it fails to explicitly address the criterion's requirement, even though the strategic posture assumes validity. Given the strict nature of the evaluation, the failure to mention the specific grounds (fraud, duress, incapacity) means the criterion is not explicitly satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3728857a-38ce-4522-a3fe-08aa354add04\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3270, "completion_tokens": 269, "total_tokens": 3539}, "latency_s": 1.147301500022877, "request_id": "wh6Vace3O4OunsEPisjO2Qc", "raw_response": null}
