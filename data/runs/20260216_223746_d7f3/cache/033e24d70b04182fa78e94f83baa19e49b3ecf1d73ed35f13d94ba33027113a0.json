The candidate answer discusses the elements of a private nuisance claim and suggests practical steps like contacting the local council. However, it never explicitly identifies or mentions that the user is seeking an injunction (the specific remedy sought in court for stopping an ongoing nuisance), although it mentions courts are reluctant to grant them. Since the criterion specifically requires the model to *correctly identify that the user is attempting to seek an injunction*, and the answer only discusses the claim elements and alternative remedies (council action) without explicitly framing the user's goal as seeking an injunction, it fails to meet the strict requirement of this criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"aea0e77e-5277-4e53-8369-53bfc1cb8edb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 753, "completion_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 947}, "latency_s": 0.9223757919971831, "request_id": "ftyUafjSCIO2xN8P9c6FqA8", "raw_response": null}
