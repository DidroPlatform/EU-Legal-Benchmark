The candidate answer discusses intervening causes (the truck driver's negligence and the second driver's actions) but does not mention the time the chair was in the road as a factor in assessing the reasonableness of the swerve or whether the driver could have avoided it differently. It focuses instead on the foreseeability of the truck driver's negligence and the foreseeability of the second driver's reaction.\", \"criterion_id\": \"53430ddb-2da1-464a-af19-ff799ad6064e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2079, "completion_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 2269}, "latency_s": 3.7799782919464633, "request_id": "Nf-UafmfKOO9kdUPqsTX2Qg", "raw_response": null}
