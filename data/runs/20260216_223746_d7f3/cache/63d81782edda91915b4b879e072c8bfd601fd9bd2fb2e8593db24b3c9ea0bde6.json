Applicable Law to Counterclaims'. It discusses the competing approaches, noting that the modern trend (Approach 3) allows tribunals to apply domestic law (like environmental obligations) if there is a sufficient nexus, even if the jurisdiction is anchored in the BIT. It further confirms this trend in the context of environmental counterclaims, citing *Perenco v. Ecuador* where the tribunal applied Ecuadorian environmental law to assess damages. This directly satisfies the criterion regarding mentioning applicable law incorporation (domestic environmental obligations integrated through analogous custom/nexus).\", \"criterion_id\": \"b21bb6a4-a9dd-4787-83a9-afdb78d12f8e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2829, "completion_tokens": 173, "total_tokens": 3002}, "latency_s": 0.9057663329876959, "request_id": "4N6UaaD2BPjwxN8P54mE4QM", "raw_response": null}
