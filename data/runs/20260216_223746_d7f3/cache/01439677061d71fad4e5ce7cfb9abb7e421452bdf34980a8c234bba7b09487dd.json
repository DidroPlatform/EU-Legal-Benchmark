The candidate answer discusses the German firm's *threat* to sue for reputation damages and analyzes the jurisdictional hurdles they face (scope of arbitration, anti-suit injunctions, German court deference). It analyzes the *defense* against the claim (pretextual termination, breach of implied covenant) and the *client's* potential counterclaim for wrongful termination. However, it never articulates the specific substantive burden of proof (the three required elements) that the German firm would need to meet *if* their claim were heard on the merits under Delaware law to recover for reputational damages.\", \"criterion_id\": \"21744557-5466-4a28-be31-f6ce0d8d39eb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4223, "completion_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 4453}, "latency_s": 0.9876539999968372, "request_id": "LMOUaYatHLGqnsEPso7fsQU", "raw_response": null}
