The response discusses 'Applicable Law and Arbitrability' (Section 3) and states that tribunals apply host-state law to counterclaims but notes that BIT claims use 'Art. 42(1) ICSID or UNCITRAL Art. 35'. While it mentions the source of applicable law (Art. 42(1) ICSID), it fails to explicitly state that the *domestic environmental obligations* are integrated *through* Article 42 or an analogous custom, which is the specific focus of the criterion. It only generally mentions the application of host-state law to counterclaims.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b21bb6a4-a9dd-4787-83a9-afdb78d12f8e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2216, "completion_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 2423}, "latency_s": 0.7518077910062857, "request_id": "cCuVacqvMLyK7M8PiJiNuAM", "raw_response": null}
