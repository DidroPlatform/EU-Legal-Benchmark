The candidate answer discusses the primary/secondary jurisdiction framework (Section 3C, 6B) and the autonomy of arbitration, but it does not explicitly mention or use the term 'delocalization theory' in relation to resisting annulment challenges (which typically fall under Article V(2)(b) or challenges to the award itself, not just jurisdiction/due process under V(1)).
