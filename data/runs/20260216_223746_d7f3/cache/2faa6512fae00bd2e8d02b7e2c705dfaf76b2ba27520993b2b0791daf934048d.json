The candidate answer explicitly addresses this by contrasting GIPs with EPA (établissements publics administratifs) and citing the *Berkani* case, which establishes the default public law presumption for EPA personnel. The candidate correctly states that GIPs are *not* subject to this jurisprudential rule and that the personnel regime depends on the constitutive convention, even if the agent contributes to public service activities. By explaining *why* the default public law rule (which applies to SPAs) does not apply to GIPs, the answer implicitly addresses the condition mentioned in the criterion (GIP whose main object is SPA) and correctly states the resulting status (not by default public law, but determined by the convention). The core message conveyed is that the nature of the mission does not automatically impose public law status, which is the key distinction relevant to the criterion's premise.\", \"criterion_id\": \"18abdf2a-eb07-4ab6-872f-df2b404b1dcb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1386, "completion_tokens": 260, "total_tokens": 1646}, "latency_s": 1.1818572909978684, "request_id": "KUeUaYrSF6zyxN8PwryZ8Q4", "raw_response": null}
