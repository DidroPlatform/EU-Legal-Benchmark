The candidate answer discusses the priority of the lender's charge over an equitable interest (constructive trust) and mentions challenging the mortgage based on fraud or undue influence, but it never explicitly states the legal principle that a registered charge against a sole proprietor cannot overreach the interests of an unnamed beneficiary (which is a specific rule often related to overreaching in land law, particularly when dealing with beneficial interests under a trust where the legal title is held by one person or as tenants in common). The response focuses more generally on priority and fraud rather than the specific overreaching doctrine mentioned in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"56903d4e-63dc-4bc3-85b3-6931cd0ed7b8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1705, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 1905}, "latency_s": 0.9419111249735579, "request_id": "lAmVab6XBcyynsEPyd_uiAQ", "raw_response": null}
