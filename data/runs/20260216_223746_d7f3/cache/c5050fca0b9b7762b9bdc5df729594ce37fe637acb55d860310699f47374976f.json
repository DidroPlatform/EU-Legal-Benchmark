Section 76(5A) specifically relates to the use of force in a dwelling house (householder defence). The candidate correctly focuses the analysis on the general self-defence provisions under s. 76(3)-(7) and common law, implicitly excluding the householder defence, which is appropriate for a 'street altercation'. The candidate's analysis correctly focuses on the 'proportionate' test under s. 76(5) and s. 76(6) for non-householder cases, thereby satisfying the requirement by omission and correct application of the relevant statutory provisions for the facts provided.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2f43efa2-6cd5-48c6-b8fd-1035de7d7d10\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4164, "completion_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 4376}, "latency_s": 1.4060456250444986, "request_id": "PfeUadvAAYqjkdUP8qvu2QQ", "raw_response": null}
