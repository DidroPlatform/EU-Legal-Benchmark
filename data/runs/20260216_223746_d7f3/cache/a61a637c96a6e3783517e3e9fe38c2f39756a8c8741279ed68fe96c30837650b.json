Countries and jurisdictions showing the most progress typically combine transparency with:\n- Strong anti-discrimination law\n- Active enforcement bodies\n- Cultural and institutional support for caregiving\n- Attention to occupational segregation\n\n**Burden of proof matters enormously.** Systems requiring employers to demonstrate equity (proactive) outperform systems requiring employees to demonstrate discrimination (reactive).\n\n**Specificity and granularity improve outcomes.** Aggregate company-wide numbers are easier to game than detailed breakdowns by role, level, and demographic intersection.\n\n**External accountability amplifies internal compliance.** Public reporting, media attention, investor pressure, and civil society monitoring create reputational incentives that complement legal ones.\n\n## Honest Uncertainties\n\nSeveral important questions remain genuinely unresolved:\n\n- **Causal attribution** is difficult—jurisdictions adopting transparency laws often simultaneously pursue other equity measures\n- **Long-term effects** are understudied since most robust transparency regimes are relatively recent\n- **Optimal design** varies by labor market context, and transferability across different institutional settings is uncertain\n- Whether transparency primarily addresses **discriminatory pay-setting** or also affects **discriminatory sorting** into roles and firms remains debated\n- The interaction between **pay transparency and pay flexibility** raises real tensions—rigid pay structures reduce gaps but may also reduce efficient matching\n\n## Assessment\n\nPay transparency and reporting obligations represent a meaningful but partial tool. They work best when they shift information asymmetries, create accountability mechanisms, and are embedded within enforcement systems that impose real consequences. They work least well when treated as standalone solutions or when designed primarily for symbolic compliance. The persistent nature of racial pay gaps in particular suggests that transparency addresses some mechanisms of inequality while leaving others—particularly those operating through segregation, hiring, and promotion—largely intact.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 34, "completion_tokens": 1189, "total_tokens": 1223}, "latency_s": 30.152580958005274, "request_id": "chatcmpl-17432775-c6e6-4214-860a-cb2a188fe92e", "raw_response": null}
