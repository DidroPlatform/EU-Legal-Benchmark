INCORRECT. In Swiss civil proceedings, experts are generally appointed by the court, not by the parties. While parties can suggest experts, the court-appointed expert system is the norm under Swiss procedural law (CPC). Party-appointed experts are generally treated as party statements, not as formal expert evidence.\\n\\nii. INCORRECT. Legal sociology follows empirical/social science methodology, not the same logic formality as legal doctrine. Legal doctrine uses normative reasoning while legal sociology uses empirical observation and social science methods.\\n\\niii. This statement appears CORRECT. The Responsible Business Initiative (which was ultimately rejected but replaced by a counter-proposal) aimed to create liability for Swiss-based multinational companies in Swiss courts for human rights and environmental violations by their foreign subsidiaries. This would indeed have changed Swiss commercial law.\\n\\niv. INCORRECT. In legal sociology, it is NOT recommended to use incompatible theories simultaneously. Good social science methodology requires theoretical coherence. Also, legal sociology does distinguish between 'is' and 'ought' - it focuses on the 'is' (empirical observation) rather than the 'ought' (normative prescription). Using theories that don't distinguish between is and ought would be methodologically problematic.\\n\\nv. INCORRECT. Under Swiss private international law (PILA), particularly for foreign insolvency decrees, Switzerland generally requires reciprocity. Article 166 PILA requires reciprocity for recognition of foreign insolvency decrees. While foreign judgments may not always require reciprocity in all matters, the statement that recognition occurs 'irrespective of' reciprocity is incorrect, especially for insolvency decrees.\\n\\nIncorrect statements: i, ii, iv, and v → Answer L.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 424, "completion_tokens": 404, "total_tokens": 828}, "latency_s": 9.151837292010896, "request_id": "chatcmpl-7e3bcd79-4f30-48e0-990a-0757f14494e2", "raw_response": null}
