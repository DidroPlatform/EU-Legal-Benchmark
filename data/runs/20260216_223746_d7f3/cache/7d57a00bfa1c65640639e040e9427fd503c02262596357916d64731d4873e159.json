The response explicitly mentions PAT testing under the EAWR section, noting that Reg.4 requires electrical systems/equipment to be maintained to prevent danger, and then states this 'includes portable appliance testing (PAT) for items >50V AC.' While it confirms PAT is *part* of compliance, it does not explicitly state that it is *not the only* method. However, in the context of the overall discussion about demonstrating reasonable steps, the response details other electrical safety measures required under EAWR and FSO (like fixed wiring inspection/EICR) which implies that PAT is one component of a broader electrical safety strategy, not the sole requirement. Given the context of UK safety law where EICR for fixed wiring is distinct from PAT for portable items, the response covers the necessary scope beyond just PAT, satisfying the spirit of the criterion by showing a multi-faceted approach to electrical safety required by EAWR.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8f03071f-4174-476a-aaad-a897fa9c3bfb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2458, "completion_tokens": 270, "total_tokens": 2728}, "latency_s": 1.11761287500849, "request_id": "aSmVacHTB-eGkdUPsqK74AQ", "raw_response": null}
