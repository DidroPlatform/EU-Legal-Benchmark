The candidate answer addresses the allocation of blame extensively in Section 3, explicitly discussing the roles of the owner (the client) as the Responsible Person (RP) under the Fire Safety Order and the neighbour as a co-occupier. It details how control (ownership vs. equipment control) influences liability, which directly relates to the concepts of shared duty under the FSO (Articles 5(3) and 22 cover the designation of the RP and shared premises, respectively). Specifically, the analysis hinges on the client's duty as RP versus the neighbour's direct breach, which is the core of how control and cooperation (or lack thereof) determine liability under the FSO.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5a7e0773-5baa-4db9-ad30-8b52ad1d1305\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4345, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 4579}, "latency_s": 0.9838097920292057, "request_id": "z-uUaZy9O7GqnsEPso7fsQU", "raw_response": null}
