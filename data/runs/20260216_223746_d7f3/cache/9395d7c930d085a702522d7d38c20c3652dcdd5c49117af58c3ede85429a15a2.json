The candidate answer mentions regulatory compliance (Section 6) covering Canadian standards, labelling, and product-specific rules (CFIA, Health Canada, WHMIS), and allocates responsibility for compliance, testing, and recalls. It also touches upon Incoterms and the Importer of Record (Section 5), which relates to import logistics. However, it does not explicitly discuss the implications of Canadian *competition law* (such as the Competition Act, which governs vertical restraints like exclusivity, resale price maintenance, and abuse of dominance) on the distribution arrangement. Therefore, the explanation regarding competition law is missing.\", \"criterion_id\": \"722d356d-883a-4a6f-90eb-737bbcf869e7\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2450, "completion_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 2643}, "latency_s": 1.032727417012211, "request_id": "pxWVac6aLbPTvdIPh7q28Qo", "raw_response": null}
