The candidate answer focuses entirely on defending the award against challenges under Article V of the New York Convention (jurisdictional challenges under V(1)(a) and due process under V(1)(b)), which are grounds for refusing recognition. While these defenses inherently touch upon the scope of the agreement (jurisdiction), the response does not explicitly delineate the difference between the court's role in confirming the *existence* of jurisdiction (jurisdictional review) versus the tribunal's role in deciding the *substance* of the dispute (merits review). The structure is organized around the Article V defenses, not the conceptual distinction requested by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e92f1752-19b6-4afc-9ea1-4277c9bf6cc0\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2637, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 2847}, "latency_s": 1.0045114580425434, "request_id": "_uqUabj9BOOXkdUPwKDLyAM", "raw_response": null}
