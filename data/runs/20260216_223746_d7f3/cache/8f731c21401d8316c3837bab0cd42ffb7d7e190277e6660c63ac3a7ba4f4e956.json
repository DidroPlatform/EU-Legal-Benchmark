This phrasing suggests three options (lost profits, infringer's profits, or reasonable royalty) rather than explicitly stating the typical Italian rule, which often favors the greater of the infringer's profits or a hypothetical license fee (reasonable royalty). While the answer mentions 'infringer's profits' and 'reasonable royalty,' it does not explicitly state the common Italian legal standard that the court typically awards the greater of these two amounts, failing to meet the specific requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d63c0c52-fb10-4d2a-93a5-5b2a3e6bb7e9\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4314, "completion_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 4549}, "latency_s": 0.9743923329806421, "request_id": "V8aUaZbzAYP3kdUPieGruQ8", "raw_response": null}
