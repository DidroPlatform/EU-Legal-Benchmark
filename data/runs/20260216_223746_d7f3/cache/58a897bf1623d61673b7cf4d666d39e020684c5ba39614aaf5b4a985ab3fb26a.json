This finding is well-documented and reflects broader patterns of media trust correlated with media repertoire types. The so-called \"News-Deprivierte\" (news-deprived) cohort, which relies heavily on social media, shows markedly lower institutional media trust.\n\n## Statement B: **Correct**\n\nArt. 93 BV embodies a **demokratie-funktionales Verständnis** (democracy-functional understanding) of electronic mass media. According to Art. 93 Abs. 2 BV, radio and television shall contribute to education and cultural development, to the free shaping of opinion (*freie Meinungsbildung*), and to entertainment. They shall take account of the particularities of the country and the needs of the cantons. This provision is explicitly designed to foster national cohesion across Switzerland's linguistic regions, cultural communities, and diverse mentalities — a function of particular importance given the country's quadrilingual structure and federalist organisation. The constitutional mandate thus serves an integrative function essential to Swiss democracy.\n\n## Statement C: **Correct**\n\nAdmeira was indeed established as a joint venture between SRG SSR, Swisscom, and Ringier, with the purpose of marketing advertising across various media channels, including through the use of personalisation technologies for online advertising. The concern articulated in the statement is legally sound: if personalisation technologies — designed primarily for targeted advertising — are extended to the curation and distribution of news and other editorial online content, this raises a tension with Art. 93 Abs. 2 BV. The constitutional requirement that radio and television contribute to the **free shaping of opinion** (\"freie Meinungsbildung\") presupposes that editorial content is not filtered or personalised in ways that create filter bubbles or undermine the diversity and universality of information supply. An extension of advertising-driven personalisation to editorial content by or through an SRG-affiliated entity could thus constitute an infringement of this constitutional mandate.\n\n## Statement D: **Incorrect**\n\nThe democracy-functional understanding of electronic mass media in Art. 93 BV does, in fact, take into account the structural and economic differences between regional media markets. Art. 93 Abs. 2 BV explicitly requires that radio and television consider the **particularities of the country and the needs of the cantons** (\"Eigenheiten des Landes und die Bedürfnisse der Kantone\"). Furthermore, the legislative framework — particularly the Bundesgesetz über Radio und Fernsehen (RTVG, SR 784.40) — implements this through mechanisms such as the fee-splitting system (Gebührenanteil) that allocates a share of licence fee revenues to regional and local broadcasters (Art. 38 ff. RTVG), precisely to address economic disparities between larger and smaller media markets. The constitutional framework is thus sensitive to regional economic asymmetries.\n\n## Statement E: **Incorrect**\n\nThe constitutional principles of **sachgerechte Darstellung** (accurate presentation of events) and **Meinungsvielfalt** (diversity of opinion), as enshrined in Art. 93 Abs. 2 BV and concretised in Art. 4 RTVG, are justiciable — but **not against any radio and television broadcaster established in Switzerland without qualification**. The programme supervision regime under the RTVG provides for complaints to the independent Unabhängige Beschwerdeinstanz für Radio und Fernsehen (UBI) pursuant to Art. 83 ff. RTVG, and these principles are enforceable through this mechanism against licensed Swiss broadcasters. However, the scope of enforceability is limited to broadcasters subject to Swiss licensing and supervision under the RTVG. Moreover, the justiciability of these principles operates primarily through the programme complaint procedure (*Programmbeschwerde*), not through ordinary civil or administrative proceedings. The statement's unqualified assertion that these principles are enforceable \"against any radio and television broadcaster established in Switzerland\" overstates the scope, as certain broadcasters may fall outside the RTVG's supervisory regime or may be subject to different regulatory frameworks (e.g., foreign-licensed broadcasters operating under the ECTT or AVMSD).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Statement | Assessment |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| A | **Correct** |\n| B | **Correct** |\n| C | **Correct** |\n| D | **Incorrect** |\n| E | **Incorrect** |", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 383, "completion_tokens": 1123, "total_tokens": 1506}, "latency_s": 22.800188875000458, "request_id": "chatcmpl-fc5178ca-571c-433a-a4f7-2bc5126f8fc5", "raw_response": null}
