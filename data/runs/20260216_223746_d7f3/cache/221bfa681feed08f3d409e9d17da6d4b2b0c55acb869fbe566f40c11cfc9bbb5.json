The response discusses using a 'UK Fiscal Representative' (Option 1 in Section 1.C) as a solution to insulate the French parent from liability. While this representative handles the import and VAT, the response does not explicitly state or explain the necessity of a 'separate, back-to-back sales contract' to prevent double VAT taxation (i.e., VAT charged by the fiscal rep to the French company AND VAT due on the final sale to the UK retailer). The concept of a back-to-back contract is a specific legal mechanism required in this scenario to manage the VAT chain correctly when using a fiscal representative, which is missing from the explanation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2941285f-f638-4e87-9944-0cebd24bc52b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2954, "completion_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 3171}, "latency_s": 1.105961875000503, "request_id": "1viUaanlH9_x7M8P1Ouu-QQ", "raw_response": null}
