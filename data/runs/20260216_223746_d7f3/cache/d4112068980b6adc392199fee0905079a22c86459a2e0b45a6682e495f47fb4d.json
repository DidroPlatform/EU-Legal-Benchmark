The candidate answer provides numerous proactive steps that *can* be taken right now (creating wills, trusts, advance directives) to protect the youngest daughter's position regarding inheritance and medical decisions, which directly contradicts the premise of the criterion (that no action can be taken presently). The user's query is about inheritance and medical decisions, not the legal recognition of an adoption, but the criterion specifically judges whether the answer claims no action can be taken regarding adoption recognition. Since the candidate answer suggests many actions can be taken now, it fails to meet the negative assertion required by this specific criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e09c7b3a-63af-4280-a0a7-1799cbe9da94\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 769, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 970}, "latency_s": 1.707568625017302, "request_id": "GsqUacKrHduXkdUPsdSSoAI", "raw_response": null}
