Section 3.2, under the 'Weight in assigning blame to **your company**' column for 'Contractual obligations', states: 'If the lease required the neighbour to PAT-test and you failed to enforce it, you share blame.' Furthermore, in Section 3.2, under the 'Resulting conclusion (probable legal view)', it states: '**Secondary (or joint) liability** will rest on **your company** as the *Responsible Person* under the Fire Safety Order because you owned the building, you had the statutory duty to ensure that *all* hazards in the out-building were identified and controlled...'. This directly addresses the principle that the owner/RP's statutory duty remains even when responsibilities are contractually assigned to another party (the neighbour).\", \"criterion_id\": \"61540037-65b5-4926-9628-43ec17bf3eec\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4333, "completion_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 4576}, "latency_s": 0.9679373339749873, "request_id": "reuUabzdArOlnsEPjtai8AQ", "raw_response": null}
