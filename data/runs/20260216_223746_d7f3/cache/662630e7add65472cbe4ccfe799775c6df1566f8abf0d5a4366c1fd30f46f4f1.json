While it doesn't use the exact phrasing \\\"conflict with a normal exploitation of the work,\\\" it directly addresses the core legal concept underpinning that assessment in the context of commercial use versus exceptions, concluding that the commercial training and subsequent advertising exploitation are far from normal exploitation and are infringing. This demonstrates an understanding of the principle required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"03e7daa7-9c1a-4107-ab25-a7c0a5db90cc\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3479, "completion_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 3711}, "latency_s": 1.6054507500084583, "request_id": "OsCUaeqhAqzzkdUPnrP0qAI", "raw_response": null}
