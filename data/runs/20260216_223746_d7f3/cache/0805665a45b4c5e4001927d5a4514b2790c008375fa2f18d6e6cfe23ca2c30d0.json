However, it fails to explicitly cite the specific laws and rules required by the criterion for supporting the coordination analyses. While it mentions the CPR, ZPO, BGB, ProdHaftG, CCP, and various US/UK codes in the context of procedural differences and risks, it does not systematically cite these laws/rules in direct support of the *coordination strategies* as explicitly required by the rubric criterion (e.g., citing the Hague Conventions for service/evidence coordination, or specific sections of the UK Companies Act/Corporate Governance Code, German AktG/KonTraG/HGB, or US ASC 450/Reg S-K for governance reporting). The citation of insurance laws (UK Insurance Act 2015/ICOBS, Germany VVG, California Insurance Code) is also entirely absent, despite being listed in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"81a868b6-0097-462d-a1d0-691b3c9cfab5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4165, "completion_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 4410}, "latency_s": 1.863767833012389, "request_id": "YNmUad3TL-OJxN8Po4aNmAM", "raw_response": null}
