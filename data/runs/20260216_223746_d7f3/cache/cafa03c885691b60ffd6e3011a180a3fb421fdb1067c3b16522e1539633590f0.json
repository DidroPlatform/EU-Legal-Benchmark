Under Swiss law (OR Art. 23 ff.), defects in consent (error, fraud, duress) generally make a contract voidable (anfechtbar), not void (nichtig). The affected party may declare the contract non-binding, but it is not automatically void. Statement v is incorrect: The Federal Council consists of seven members who are equal in rank — there is no Prime Minister. The Federal President is merely primus inter pares, rotates annually, has no special powers to dissolve the Federal Assembly, and Switzerland has no mechanism for dissolving parliament. Statements i, iii, and iv are correct descriptions of Swiss law.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 323, "completion_tokens": 171, "total_tokens": 494}, "latency_s": 4.78740737499902, "request_id": "chatcmpl-e327b835-4ea8-414a-b0c4-70fe946691bc", "raw_response": null}
