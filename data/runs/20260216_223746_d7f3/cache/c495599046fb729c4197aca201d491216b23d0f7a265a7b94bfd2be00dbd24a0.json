The response discusses the lender's charge priority, focusing on the timing of the equitable interest versus the charge, notice, and fraud. It mentions that for the lender's charge to take priority, certain conditions (like lack of notice or actual occupation) must be met, which relates to the concept of overreaching, but it never explicitly states the rule that a purchaser (or lender) is only bound if the interest was *not* overreached. The focus is on notice and priority based on timing, not the specific mechanism of overreaching as the binding condition.\", \"criterion_id\": \"df80a01f-5c25-46b6-9fa5-097a4aa3f543\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1841, "completion_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 2035}, "latency_s": 1.0117641660035588, "request_id": "friUaef-BoqB7M8P4pHemAI", "raw_response": null}
