The candidate answer focuses heavily on the user being a squatter/licensee, the criminalisation of squatting, and the impact of the user's absence. It discusses the new owner's rights and the user's lack of substantive rights, but it never explicitly states or highlights the legal principle that any protection the occupier might have must have existed 'at the time of the disposition' (i.e., when the buyer purchased the property). The answer implies this by stating the old landlord's tolerance doesn't bind the new owner, but it fails to articulate the specific legal requirement mentioned in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b1d17dc7-cd11-411d-88af-47cab931fcfe\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1237, "completion_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 1433}, "latency_s": 0.8605136250262149, "request_id": "-iKVaZmDMYKN7M8Pn42j8Qg", "raw_response": null}
