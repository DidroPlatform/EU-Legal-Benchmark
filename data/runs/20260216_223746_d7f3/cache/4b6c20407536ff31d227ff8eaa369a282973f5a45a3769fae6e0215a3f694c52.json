No rent payments means no assured shorthold tenancy (AST) or other protected tenancy under the Housing Act 1988 or Protection from Eviction Act 1977. Long-term presence doesn't automatically create tenancy rights without agreement or rent.\n  \n- **Squatting is criminal**: Since the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (s.144), squatting in **residential** properties (like a London flat) is a criminal offence, punishable by up to 51 weeks in prison or £5,000 fine. Police can evict active squatters without a court order if they confirm it's residential and you're trespassing.\n\n- **Your absence weakens any claim**:\n  - Leaving for 6 months (even with belongings left) likely breaks \"continuous occupation.\" This undermines any fringe argument for **adverse possession** (claiming ownership after 10 years under Land Registration Act 2002), which was already unlikely for a room in a leased flat (adverse possession applies to land ownership, not tenancy, and requires strict proof of exclusive possession/intent).\n  - Belongings alone don't make it your \"home\" indefinitely—courts view abandonment (e.g., ignoring contact, long absence) as ending occupation.\n\n- **New owner's rights**: As the purchaser, they own the freehold/leasehold. They can:\n  1. **Apply for a possession order** via County Court (fast-tracked for squatters under Part 55 CPR—often 1-4 weeks). You'd get notice but limited defence.\n  2. **Criminal route**: Report to police for trespass/squatting if you return.\n  3. Self-help eviction (e.g., changing locks) is illegal without court order (criminal offence under Criminal Law Act 1977), but they could remove unattended belongings after notice.\n\n### What Protection Do You Have?\n- **Minimal procedural safeguards**:\n  - Can't be evicted without **court order** if you physically return and claim it's your home (Human Rights Act 1998, Art.8).\n  - Right to challenge in court (e.g., argue implied license from old landlord), but success rate is near-zero without rent/tenancy evidence.\n- **No substantive right to stay**: 10 years tolerance by old landlord doesn't bind new owner. No \"squatter's rights\" like pre-2012.\n\n### Recommended Actions\n1. **Contact free legal help ASAP**:\n   - **Shelter** (0808 800 4444, shelter.org.uk) or **Citizens Advice** (0800 144 8848)—specialists in evictions/squatting.\n   - **Housing Ombudsman** or local council if any tenancy angle.\n2. **Don't return without advice**: Risks arrest/eviction.\n3. **Negotiate**: Offer to remove belongings quickly for peaceful exit (new owner might agree to avoid court).\n4. **Collect evidence**: Old landlord comms, belongings inventory—weak but helpful.\n5. **Timeline**: Act now—possession claims move fast.\n\nIgnoring this risks bailiffs, criminal record, and costs orders against you. Voluntary exit is safest. This isn't legal advice—get professional confirmation tailored to your exact setup (e.g., flat lease type).", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 300, "completion_tokens": 1384, "total_tokens": 1684}, "latency_s": 15.375026082998374, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJ9TB0QFYF1Y4T0K2X1TWZ", "raw_response": null}
