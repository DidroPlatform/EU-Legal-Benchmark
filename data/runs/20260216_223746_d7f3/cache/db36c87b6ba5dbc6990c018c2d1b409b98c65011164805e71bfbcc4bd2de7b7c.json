The candidate answer mentions Section 267A risk in the context of debt financing, stating that the equity approach avoids potential Section 267A complications. However, it does not explicitly list or discuss specific mitigation methods for Section 267A (like check-the-box elections or consistent classifications) that the taxpayer could *implement* to manage the risk if debt financing were chosen or if a mismatch arose. The discussion is descriptive of the risk rather than prescriptive regarding mitigation techniques for that specific section.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c05399c2-d5e1-4ad7-9c7a-4923f72f8897\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2309, "completion_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 2501}, "latency_s": 0.6513742080423981, "request_id": "7SCVadbvJJC-nsEPxMmk4QY", "raw_response": null}
