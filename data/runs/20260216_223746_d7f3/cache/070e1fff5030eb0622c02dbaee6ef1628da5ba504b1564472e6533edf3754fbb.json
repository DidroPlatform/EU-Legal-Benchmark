However, none of the listed KPIs explicitly detail the required calculation methodology, the specific data source(s) used, or the concrete evidence required for validation. The 'Reporting Cadence' is provided separately from the KPI definition, not as a component of the KPI itself, and it only specifies the frequency, not the update frequency *of the KPI metric* as required by the criterion's structure.\", \"criterion_id\": \"57ad7af5-eddd-4aec-ae1f-a633b09bbdb2\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1464, "completion_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 1667}, "latency_s": 5.382112207997125, "request_id": "0jKVaY7ZNYKN7M8Pn42j8Qg", "raw_response": null}
