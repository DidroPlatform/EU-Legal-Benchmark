Here's why:\n\n## Legal Requirements\n\nUnder **GDPR** (which applies in France), even simple data collection requires:\n\n- **Transparency**: Members must know data is being collected\n- **Information notice**: Details about what you're collecting and why\n- **Lawful basis**: A valid reason (yours would be \"legitimate interest\" in planning activities)\n\n## What You Should Have Done\n\nIdeally, before collecting the form:\n- Provide a brief notice explaining the data collection\n- State how long you'll keep the information\n- Clarify who has access to it\n- Explain members' rights (access, correction, deletion)\n\n## The Good News\n\nFor a small local association collecting basic sports ability data:\n- The risk level is relatively low\n- You likely have a clear legitimate purpose\n- The data isn't sensitive (unless health conditions were detailed)\n- Retroactive compliance is often possible\n\n## Practical Next Steps\n\n1. **Document your process** - write down why you collected it and how it's stored\n2. **Check your association's rules** - you may already have general consent provisions\n3. **Consider a simple notice** for future collections\n4. **Consult CNIL** (France's data authority) if concerned - they're generally helpful with small organizations\n\nFor a one-time summer survey by a local association, this is unlikely to cause problems, but transparency going forward is important.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 93, "completion_tokens": 328, "total_tokens": 421}, "latency_s": 4.428140542004257, "request_id": "chatcmpl-5d0e12f1-bfbd-4eb4-8a97-691a6a3d6b14", "raw_response": null}
