Illegal additions or modifications are **extremely common** in Italy and can become *your* problem.\n- **Cadastral conformity (*conformità catastale*)**: The floor plan on file must match the actual property.\n- **Building habitability certificate (*agibilità*)**: Not all properties have one, especially older ones. Its absence can affect financing and resale.\n- **Energy performance certificate (*APE*)**: Legally required for any sale.\n\n### 2. **What the *Compromesso* Commits You To**\n- You'll typically pay a **deposit (*caparra confirmatoria*)**, usually 10–30% of the price.\n- If **you** back out, you **lose the deposit**.\n- If the **seller** backs out, they must return **double the deposit**.\n- The contract sets a deadline for the final deed (*rogito*). Missing it can trigger penalties.\n\n### 3. **Hidden Costs to Budget For**\n- **Notary fees (*notaio*)**: The notary is mandatory and chosen (and paid) by the buyer. Expect €2,000–5,000+.\n- **Registration taxes**: For a *prima casa* (primary residence), roughly **2% of cadastral value**; for a second home, **9%**. If buying from a developer, **4% or 10% VAT** applies instead.\n- **Agency fees**: Typically **3–4% + VAT** from *each* party (buyer and seller), though this is negotiable.\n- **Mortgage costs**: If financing, expect appraisal fees, *imposta sostitutiva* (0.25% for primary residence), and bank processing fees.\n- **Renovation surprises**: Especially with older properties — structural issues, asbestos, outdated electrical/plumbing systems.\n- **Condominium arrears**: If it's an apartment, unpaid *spese condominiali* can transfer to the buyer. Request the *liberatoria* from the building administrator.\n\n### 4. **Common Traps**\n- **Undeclared price**: Some sellers propose declaring a lower price in the deed to reduce taxes. This is **tax fraud** and increasingly prosecuted.\n- **Abusi edilizi (building violations)**: If the property has unauthorized modifications, you may be required to legalize them (*sanatoria*) at your expense — or worse, demolish them.\n- **Pre-emption rights (*diritto di prelazione*)**: Agricultural land neighbors, tenants, or the state (for heritage properties) may have the right to match your offer.\n- **Foreign buyer restrictions**: Generally none for EU citizens. Non-EU citizens can buy if there's a reciprocity treaty with their home country (the US, UK, Canada, etc. are covered).\n\n---\n\n## Strong Recommendations\n\n1. **Hire an independent lawyer (*avvocato*)** — not the seller's, not the agent's. Ideally one experienced in Italian real estate and who speaks your language.\n2. **Don't rely solely on the notary** — the *notaio* is a neutral public official who ensures legality of the deed, but they don't advocate for *your* interests.\n3. **Include protective clauses** in the *compromesso*:\n   - Subject to mortgage approval (*clausola sospensiva per mutuo*)\n   - Subject to clean urban planning compliance\n   - Subject to satisfactory building inspection\n4. **Get a technical survey (*perizia tecnica*)** done by a *geometra* or architect before signing.\n5. **Register the *compromesso*** at the *Agenzia delle Entrate* — this protects you if the seller tries to sell to someone else.\n\n---\n\n## Timeline Overview\n\n| Step | Typical Timeframe |\n|---|---|\n| Property offer (*proposta d'acquisto*) | Binding once accepted |\n| *Compromesso* | Usually 1–4 weeks after offer |\n| Final deed (*rogito*) | Typically 2–4 months after *compromesso* |\n\n---\n\nWould you like more detail on any specific aspect — such as buying as a non-resident, tax benefits for *prima casa*, or the renovation bonus (*superbonus/bonus ristrutturazione*) situation?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 45, "completion_tokens": 1113, "total_tokens": 1158}, "latency_s": 25.59533233300317, "request_id": "chatcmpl-03155ab6-08c3-434d-bda2-bc0528b821e7", "raw_response": null}
