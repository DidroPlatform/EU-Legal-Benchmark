This means the founders alone cannot pass supermajority resolutions — which is actually a structural advantage for you. But they **can** control all ordinary resolutions (>50%). That asymmetry should drive your entire negotiation strategy.\n\n---\n\n## Tier 1: Non-Negotiable Provisions\n\nThese are the provisions you **must** have. Without any one of them, your 25% stake is seriously exposed.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Consent/Veto Catalogue (Zustimmungskatalog)\n\n**Why it is critical**\n\nAt 25%, you are blocked from initiating anything but you can block supermajority items by default under statute. The real risk is **ordinary-majority decisions** where the founders can outvote you unilaterally. You need a contractual veto list that goes beyond the statutory supermajority requirement.\n\n**What to insist on**\n\nRequire your **prior written consent** for at least:\n\n- New share issuances or any dilutive measures\n- Changes to the articles of association (Satzung)\n- Annual budgets and any expenditure above a defined threshold\n- Related-party transactions involving founders\n- Taking on debt above a threshold\n- Hiring/firing of managing directors (Geschäftsführer)\n- Any change of business purpose\n- Distributions and dividend policy\n- Creation of any new share classes or preference rights\n- Sale or encumbrance of material IP or assets\n\n**How to justify it to the founders**\n\n> *\"Under German market practice, Series A investors with a 20–25% stake routinely receive a consent catalogue. This is standard in BVCA and BVK term sheets. We are not asking for operational control — you run the company. We are asking for protection against decisions that could fundamentally alter the value of our investment without our input. German VC associations (BVK) publish model term sheets that include exactly this.\"*\n\nPoint them to the **BVK Model Term Sheet** and the **GVCA (German Venture Capital Association) standards**, which treat investor consent rights at this level as entirely normal.\n\n**Drafting note under German law**\n\nConsent catalogues in a GmbH SHA are enforceable as **obligations inter partes**. However, for maximum protection, mirror the key items as **Satzung provisions** (articles of association), because purely contractual SHA provisions do not bind the company itself — only the shareholders. A resolution passed in breach of a Satzung-level consent requirement is **voidable** (anfechtbar) under § 243 AktG analogously applied, whereas breach of a purely SHA-level consent right only gives you a damages claim. Push to embed the most critical vetoes in the Satzung.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Anti-Dilution Protection\n\n**Why it is critical**\n\nYour 25% is your leverage. If the founders can issue new shares (even via a future round) without structural protection, your stake — and with it your blocking position on supermajority matters — can be diluted below the critical thresholds.\n\n**What to insist on**\n\n- **Pre-emptive rights (Bezugsrecht):** Statutory pre-emptive rights do not exist by default in a GmbH (unlike an AG). You must contractually create them. Insist on pro-rata subscription rights on any new issuance.\n- **Weighted-average anti-dilution:** In a down round, your conversion or effective price adjusts. Full ratchet is aggressive and founders will resist it; broad-based weighted average is market standard and defensible.\n- **Pay-to-play carve-out:** Founders may ask that anti-dilution only applies if you participate in future rounds. This is reasonable and you can concede it — it shows good faith.\n\n**How to justify it**\n\n> *\"Pre-emptive rights are standard in virtually every German VC deal. The GmbHG does not provide them by default, which is precisely why they must be contractually agreed. Weighted-average anti-dilution is the moderate, market-standard approach — we are not asking for full ratchet.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 3. Liquidation Preference\n\n**Why it is critical**\n\nWithout a liquidation preference, your Series A investment is returned pro rata — meaning in a bad exit, the founders' 60% takes the majority of whatever is left, even though your capital funded the growth. This is the single most important economic protection.\n\n**What to insist on**\n\n- **1x non-participating preferred** is the cleanest and most founder-friendly version. You get your money back first; if the exit value exceeds the point where pro-rata would give you more, you convert and take pro-rata instead.\n- Avoid pushing for participating preferred with no cap — founders will (rightly) resist this, and it is increasingly disfavoured in European deals.\n- The preference should cover **all exit events**: trade sale, IPO, liquidation, and deemed liquidation events (asset sales, exclusive licensing of all IP, etc.).\n\n**How to justify it**\n\n> *\"A 1x non-participating preference is the most founder-friendly structure available. It simply ensures we recover our invested capital before profits are shared. This is universal in European Series A rounds — the BVCA model documents and the German BVK model term sheet both assume it. We are not asking for a multiple.\"*\n\n**German law note**\n\nLiquidation preferences in a GmbH are typically structured through **preference share rights in the Satzung** (§ 29 GmbHG allows differentiated profit rights) combined with **SHA waterfall provisions**. Ensure the Satzung actually creates a preference share class — a purely contractual waterfall in the SHA is enforceable between the parties but does not bind a liquidator or insolvency administrator.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Tag-Along Right (Mitveräußerungsrecht)\n\n**Why it is critical**\n\nIf the founders sell their 60%, you must not be left behind as a trapped 25% minority in a company controlled by a stranger. Tag-along is your **exit insurance**.\n\n**What to insist on**\n\n- Full tag-along: if founders sell **any** shares, you can sell on the same terms, pro rata.\n- The tag must apply to **indirect transfers** as well (e.g., if a founder transfers shares to a holding company and then sells the holding company).\n- Include a **drag-along** as the reciprocal — founders will want this, and it is reasonable. But set a **minimum price floor** on the drag (e.g., at least 1x your liquidation preference amount) so you cannot be dragged into a fire sale.\n\n**How to justify it**\n\n> *\"Tag-along is a basic minority protection recognised in every jurisdiction. Under German law, a minority shareholder in a GmbH has no statutory right to participate in a third-party sale. Without a tag-along, we could be locked into a company with new controlling shareholders and no exit path. This is not controversial — it is in every BVK and BVCA model SHA.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 5. Information and Audit Rights\n\n**Why it is critical**\n\n§ 51a GmbHG gives shareholders a statutory right to information, but it is **limited** — it covers access to books and records but does not guarantee regular financial reporting, board-level information flow, or the right to conduct an independent audit. As a 25% minority investor deploying significant capital, you need much more.\n\n**What to insist on**\n\n- Monthly management accounts (P&L, balance sheet, cash flow) within 20 business days of month-end\n- Annual audited financial statements (even if the GmbH is below the statutory audit threshold under § 316 HGB)\n- Quarterly board/investor updates with KPIs\n- Right to appoint an independent auditor for a special audit at your cost (with company cooperation obligations)\n- Immediate notification of material adverse events, litigation, or regulatory issues\n\n**How to justify it**\n\n> *\"The statutory information right under § 51a is a floor, not a ceiling. Market practice in German VC deals is to supplement it with regular reporting obligations. We need visibility to support the company — not to micromanage. An annual audit protects all shareholders, including the founders, by ensuring financial discipline.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Tier 2: Strongly Recommended Provisions\n\nThese are not existential in the way Tier 1 items are, but they significantly strengthen your position and are **standard in German Series A deals**. Push for them, but these are where you have room to negotiate and make concessions.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Founder Vesting / Good Leaver–Bad Leaver\n\n**Why it matters**\n\nThe founders hold 60%. If one leaves early and retains their full stake, you have a dead-weight shareholder with no operational contribution. Vesting ensures founders earn their equity over time.\n\n**Recommended structure**\n\n- 4-year vesting with a 1-year cliff (if not already vested from a prior period, adjust for time already served)\n- **Bad leaver** (termination for cause, competitive activity, fraud): company or remaining shareholders repurchase at nominal value (Nennwert) or a steep discount\n- **Good leaver** (death, disability, termination without cause): repurchase at fair market value (Verkehrswert), determined by an independent valuer or a contractual formula\n- Reverse vesting is the standard German mechanic — founders hold shares from day one but are subject to a **call option (Einziehung or Abtretungsverpflichtung)** on unvested shares\n\n**How to justify it**\n\n> *\"Founder vesting is standard in every institutional Series A in Germany. It protects you as founders too — if one co-founder leaves, the remaining founder is not stuck with a departed co-founder holding a large block. The BVK model term sheet includes vesting as a default provision.\"*\n\n**German law note**\n\nImplement via a **compulsory transfer obligation (Abtretungsverpflichtung)** in the SHA combined with a **share redemption clause (Einziehungsklausel)** in the Satzung under § 34 GmbHG. The Satzung must authorise redemption — it cannot be done purely contractually.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Advisory Board / Observer Seat (Beirat)\n\n**Why it matters**\n\nA GmbH has no mandatory supervisory board (unlike a large AG). Without a contractual governance body, the Geschäftsführer (typically the founders) run the company with minimal oversight.\n\n**Recommended structure**\n\n- Establish a **Beirat** (advisory board) in the Satzung\n- You appoint one member; founders appoint two; optionally one independent member\n- The Beirat approves the consent catalogue items (this is an alternative to pure shareholder-level vetoes and can be more practical for operational decisions)\n- Beirat has the right to hire/fire the Geschäftsführer (or at least a consent right)\n\n**How to justify it**\n\n> *\"A Beirat is standard in German VC-backed GmbHs. It provides structured governance without the formality of a full Aufsichtsrat. It benefits the founders too — having an advisory board with investor representation signals maturity to future investors and acquirers.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 8. Transfer Restrictions and Right of First Refusal (ROFR)\n\n**Why it matters**\n\nYou do not want unknown third parties entering the cap table. Equally, founders will not want you to sell your 25% to a competitor.\n\n**Recommended structure**\n\n- **Vinkulierung** (transfer restriction) in the Satzung: all share transfers require shareholder approval (this is very common in GmbH practice and founders will likely agree)\n- **ROFR**: if any shareholder wants to sell, existing shareholders have a right of first refusal at the offered price, pro rata\n- Permitted transfers to affiliates without ROFR trigger (standard carve-out)\n\n**How to justify it**\n\n> *\"Vinkulierung is the default in most German GmbH articles. ROFR is mutual — it protects you from us selling to someone you do not want, and it protects us from you selling to someone we do not want. This is entirely symmetric.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 9. Exit Provisions / Deadlock Resolution\n\n**Why it matters**\n\nGmbH shares are illiquid. Without a contractual exit mechanism, you could be trapped indefinitely.\n\n**Recommended provisions**\n\n- **Qualified IPO obligation:** if the company reaches defined milestones (revenue, EBITDA, or a time horizon — e.g., 5–7 years post-investment), the shareholders agree to pursue an IPO or trade sale process in good faith\n- **Deadlock resolution:** if shareholders are deadlocked on a fundamental matter, a structured escalation — mediation → expert determination → put/call mechanism (Russian roulette or Texas shoot-out, though these are more common in JVs than VC deals)\n- **Put option (limited):** after a defined period (e.g., 7 years), if no exit has occurred, you have the right to require the company or founders to buy your shares at fair market value. **This is aggressive and founders will resist it.** Frame it as a backstop, not a primary mechanism.\n\n**How to justify it**\n\n> *\"We are a fund with a finite life. We need a path to liquidity. A qualified IPO provision does not force anything — it creates a good-faith obligation to explore exit options after a reasonable period. This is standard in PE and VC deals across Europe.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Tier 3: Useful but Expendable\n\nThese are provisions you can **offer to drop** as concessions during negotiation to secure Tier 1 and Tier 2 items.\n\n- **Redemption rights** (beyond the limited put option above) — aggressive and unusual in German VC\n- **Full ratchet anti-dilution** — trade down to weighted average\n- **Multiple liquidation preference** (2x, 3x) — trade down to 1x non-participating\n- **Broad founder non-compete beyond statutory limits** — German courts are restrictive on post-termination non-competes (§ 138 BGB, § 1 GWB); a 2-year non-compete is the practical maximum and must be reasonable in scope\n- **Detailed operational veto rights** (e.g., approval of individual hires below C-level) — these annoy founders and add little value\n\n---\n\n## Negotiation Strategy: Sequencing and Framing\n\n### How to present this to the founders\n\n**Do not deliver a 40-page SHA draft as your opening move.** Instead:\n\n1. **Start with a term sheet** that covers Tier 1 items plus selected Tier 2 items. Keep it to 4–6 pages. Reference the BVK model term sheet explicitly — this normalises your asks.\n\n2. **Frame everything as mutual protection:**\n - Vesting protects founders from each other\n - ROFR protects everyone from unwanted third parties\n - Consent rights protect the company from hasty decisions\n - Liquidation preference simply ensures capital recovery before profit sharing\n\n3. **Concede Tier 3 items early** to build goodwill. If founders push back on full ratchet, \"concede\" to weighted average (which is what you wanted anyway). If they resist a 2x preference, \"concede\" to 1x non-participating.\n\n4. **Use the employee pool as leverage:** The 15% employee pool holders will eventually need an SHA framework too. A well-structured SHA protects the founders' position relative to a growing and fragmenting cap table — not just yours.\n\n### Anticipated founder pushback and responses\n\n| Founder objection | Your response |\n|---|---|\n| \"We don't want to give up control\" | \"You retain 60% and appoint the Geschäftsführer. Consent rights only apply to extraordinary matters — you run the business day-to-day.\" |\n| \"Vesting feels like we're being treated as employees\" | \"Vesting is standard in every institutional round. It protects you from each other. If your co-founder leaves, you don't want them holding 30% with no contribution.\" |\n| \"Liquidation preference means you get paid first\" | \"Only in a downside scenario. In a successful exit, we convert to common and share pro rata. The preference only matters if things go badly — and in that case, it's fair that invested capital is returned first.\" |\n| \"We don't want a Beirat — it slows us down\" | \"A Beirat meets quarterly. It provides governance that future Series B investors will expect anyway. Better to establish it now on terms you help design than have it imposed later.\" |\n| \"Anti-dilution is unfair to future investors\" | \"Weighted-average anti-dilution is the global standard. It only triggers in a down round — which means something has gone wrong. It partially protects our entry price, not fully.\" |\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Priority Matrix\n\n| Priority | Provision | Founder resistance | Your leverage |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Must have** | Consent catalogue (in Satzung) | Medium | BVK standard; structural necessity", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 129, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 4225}, "latency_s": 100.15146795901819, "request_id": "chatcmpl-0ab4d9b8-71e7-42e4-af4b-6faa50bac166", "raw_response": null}
