{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 0, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires the response to advise that a \\\"bad leaver\\\" repurchase of shares at a nominal or low value carries a high risk of being deemed void or unenforceable under BGB principles of good faith (§138 BGB). The candidate response recommends repurchasing shares from a 'Bad leaver' at 'nominal value (Nennwert) or a steep discount' and suggests implementing this via a compulsory transfer obligation (Abtretungsverpflichtung) and share redemption clause (Einziehungsklausel) in the Satzung. While it correctly identifies the German legal mechanisms (Abtretungsverpflichtung, Einziehungsklausel) and mentions § 138 BGB in the context of non-competes, it *fails* to explicitly warn the user that repurchasing shares from a bad leaver at a *nominal or low value* (as recommended) is highly susceptible to being voided under § 138 BGB (usury/good faith) in German courts, especially if the shares have significant intrinsic value. The advice given is standard market practice in many jurisdictions but is legally risky in Germany without careful valuation caveats, which are omitted here.\", \"criterion_id\": \"0b16f111-b8e7-4f68-8490-5fb00442097f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4143, "completion_tokens": 294, "total_tokens": 4437}, "latency_s": 1.2097814160224516, "request_id": "db-UaeTrAY3hnsEP38LqiQY", "raw_response": null}
