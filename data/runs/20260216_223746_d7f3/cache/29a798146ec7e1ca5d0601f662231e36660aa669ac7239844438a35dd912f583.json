{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 0, \"reasoning\": \"The candidate response attempts to cite relevant laws and rules for procedural analysis (e.g., CPR 11, ZPO §261(3)(2), CCP §410.30, Hague Convention, Brussels Recast Regulation). However, the criterion specifically requires citations supporting the *coordination analyses* for governance, reporting, and insurance, referencing specific statutes/codes for those areas. The response cites UK Companies Act 2006, UK Corporate Governance Code, German AktG/KonTraG/HGB, US/California Reg S-K, ASC 450, PCAOB/AU-C 501, UK Insurance Act 2015/ICOBS, Germany VVG, and California Insurance Code only in the context of the *unanswered* sections (Governance and Insurance). Since the candidate answer does not address Governance and Insurance obligations (Sections III and IV are missing entirely) and the cited laws in the provided sections (I and II) do not fully align with the required list for coordination/governance/insurance support, the criterion is not met. For example, there is no mention of Reg S-K, ASC 450, PCAOB/AU-C 501, or the specific German corporate governance/auditing laws (AktG/KonTraG/HGB/IDW PS) in the context of reporting obligations, nor are the insurance laws cited in the context of insurance coverage implications.\", \"criterion_id\": \"81a868b6-0097-462d-a1d0-691b3c9cfab5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4374, "completion_tokens": 355, "total_tokens": 4729}, "latency_s": 1.7051105829887092, "request_id": "nMqUacrfGL3ukdUPjeSHsAM", "raw_response": null}
