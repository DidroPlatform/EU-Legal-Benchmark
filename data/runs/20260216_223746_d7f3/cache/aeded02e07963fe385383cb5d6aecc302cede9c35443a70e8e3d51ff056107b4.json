This was indeed approved by Swiss voters on May 15, 2022 (not May 16, but that's the date it was accepted). The content accurately describes Art. 24b FiG.\n**Status: TRUE** (minor date discrepancy but substance is correct)\n\n**Statement ii**: About the net wealth increase theory (Reinvermögenszugangstheorie)\nThis theory states that income equals all economic goods flowing to a taxpayer during a period that can be used for personal needs without reducing their wealth. This is an accurate description of the Reinvermögenszugangstheorie, which is the theoretical basis for Swiss income taxation.\n**Status: TRUE**\n\n**Statement iii**: About cantonal tax competence\nThis states cantons have subsidiary general competence for taxation and can levy all taxes not expressly reserved to the Confederation. This is correct according to Art. 3 BV (Swiss Constitution) - cantons are sovereign except where the Constitution limits their sovereignty, and they have residual tax powers.\n**Status: TRUE**\n\n**Statement iv**: About occupational pension (berufliche Vorsorge)\nThis describes the purpose of the second pillar (BVG/LPP) - to maintain accustomed living standards together with AHV/IV. It mentions that ESTV (Federal Tax Administration) specifies principles of appropriateness, collectivity, equal treatment, systematic planning, and insurance principle. However, these principles are primarily defined by the **BVG law itself and supervised by the BVG supervisory authorities**, not primarily by ESTV. ESTV's role is mainly in tax recognition of pension institutions, not in defining the fundamental BVG principles.\n**Status: FALSE** (ESTV doesn't primarily define these principles)\n\nThe false statement is **iv**.\n\n{\"answer\": \"J\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement iv is false because the fundamental principles of occupational pension (appropriateness, collectivity, equal treatment, systematic planning, insurance principle) are defined by BVG law and supervised by BVG authorities, not primarily specified by ESTV (Federal Tax Administration). ESTV's role is limited to tax recognition aspects.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 846, "completion_tokens": 550, "total_tokens": 1396}, "latency_s": 11.014033040992217, "request_id": "chatcmpl-e96a2e4f-df14-4b93-bb26-5bca49f16873", "raw_response": null}
