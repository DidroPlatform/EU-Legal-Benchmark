The candidate answer discusses Moral Rights in Section 4, mentioning the 'Right to be identified as author' and the 'Right of integrity'. It states that the paternity right 'generally must be asserted in writing to bite in many common contexts' and that the integrity right is 'fact-specific'. It does not explicitly state the condition required by the rubric: that the breach only occurs when the act is done by someone who 'publishes commercially or exhibits in public'.
