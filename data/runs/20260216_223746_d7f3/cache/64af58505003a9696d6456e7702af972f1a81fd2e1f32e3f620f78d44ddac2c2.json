The candidate answer explicitly argues the opposite: that the swerve was a *voluntary, reckless act* that was *directly* linked to the injury and that the chain of causation was *not* broken by the chair. The candidate analysis focuses on why the swerve *is* the proximate cause, not why it *should be considered* an intervening act that breaks the chain (which is the argument specified in the criterion). The candidate does not present the required argument about what a reasonable person would have done *instead* of swerving (i.e., planned a careful merge or stopped).\", \"criterion_id\": \"59f0e49d-855e-44f4-bd5f-6e656891aa30\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3220, "completion_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 3446}, "latency_s": 0.9114877919782884, "request_id": "i--UababNrzhnsEPwLCgiQY", "raw_response": null}
