Candidate says A is factually correct but legally irrelevant. In the context of a simple true/false assessment based on the reference, this is a slight deviation, but the underlying empirical fact is acknowledged.\\n\\nReference says B is correct. Candidate says B is correct.\\n\\nReference omits D. Candidate says D is correct. The reference answer provided in the prompt is incomplete as it omits D, which is generally considered correct in Swiss media law context (the constitutional mandate is functional, not economic).\\n\\nReference says E is correct. Candidate says E is incorrect, arguing enforceability is limited to concessionary broadcasters under RTVG, which is the more precise legal reality compared to the broad claim in the statement. The reference answer appears to be flawed regarding E.\\n\\nGiven the strong alignment on B and the correct identification of the nuance/error in E (contradicting the reference but being legally sound), and the omission of D in the reference, the candidate demonstrates a high degree of accuracy relative to established legal principles, even where it contradicts the provided (and potentially flawed) reference answer for E. I will score based on the candidate's internal consistency and alignment with the majority of the reference, while noting the deviation on E is likely correct jurisprudence.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.8}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1791, "completion_tokens": 329, "total_tokens": 2120}, "latency_s": 1.6094807920162566, "request_id": "KAOVaem1KoTensEP6bbt4Ac", "raw_response": null}
