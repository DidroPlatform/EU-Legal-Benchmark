The candidate answer discusses the Brazil-Luxembourg Double Tax Treaty and mentions 'treaty-based withholding tax reduction on dividends,' but it fails to explicitly state the underlying domestic Brazilian tax rule that dividends distributed from a Brazilian company (whether a corporation or limited liability company) to any shareholder, resident or non-resident, are generally exempt from Brazilian withholding income tax under domestic law (Lei 9.430/96, Art. 10, § 1, and subsequent interpretations).
