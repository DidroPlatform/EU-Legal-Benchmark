The candidate answer states that the court typically acts where it is necessary and where the tribunal cannot act effectively in time (urgency), or where the tribunal lacks coercive reach. This suggests the tribunal's inability to act effectively is a key factor influencing the court's decision to act, but it does not state that the court *shall act only if* the tribunal cannot act effectively. The answer presents this as one of several conditions influencing discretion, rather than an absolute prerequisite for the court's power or action under s.44.\", \"criterion_id\": \"99bd5e85-c863-444f-96b7-f20fdf0e4b8d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1660, "completion_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 1848}, "latency_s": 86.6682956670411, "request_id": "AxqVaYXJGbW5kdUP1c_0sAM", "raw_response": null}
