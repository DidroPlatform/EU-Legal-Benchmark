Under section I.B.1, it states that German courts 'should decline jurisdiction under New York Convention Art. II(3)' for contract-based claims because the arbitration agreement covers disputes 'arising out of' the contract. It further suggests filing a jurisdictional objection in German courts and considering an anti-suit injunction from English courts. This directly satisfies the requirement to identify that filing in court would be a breach and that the German court should dismiss or stay the action.\", \"criterion_id\": \"50faad98-d961-4c12-a76b-ce59b94c7973\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2714, "completion_tokens": 162, "total_tokens": 2876}, "latency_s": 1.0436163340054918, "request_id": "B9KUabPTHYvw7M8PibDEsAI", "raw_response": null}
