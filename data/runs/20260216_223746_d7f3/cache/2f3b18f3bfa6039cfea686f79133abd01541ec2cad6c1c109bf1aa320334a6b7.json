The criterion requires identifying that Spain reserved the right to not apply the terms set forth in Article 9(5) with respect to *all* Contracting Parties. The candidate answer incorrectly links the applicability of Article 9(5)-(6) to whether Belgium made a reservation under Article 14(3), which is not what the reservation text implies regarding Spain's general stance on Article 9(5) and (6). Furthermore, the candidate answer does not clearly state that Spain reserved the right not to apply Article 9(5) against *all* Contracting Parties, which is the core requirement of the criterion. The analysis provided in section 4 is speculative and does not directly address the specific reservation requirement mentioned in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"criterion 7\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1589, "completion_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 1798}, "latency_s": 0.8783235000446439, "request_id": "HiKVabCpMaeN7M8P-7HT8Qg", "raw_response": null}
