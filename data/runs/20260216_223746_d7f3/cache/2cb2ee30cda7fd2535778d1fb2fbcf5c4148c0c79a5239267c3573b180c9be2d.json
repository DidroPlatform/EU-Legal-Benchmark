The candidate answer discusses the user's absence weakening any claim and mentions that leaving for 6 months likely breaks 'continuous occupation,' which touches upon the concept. However, it does not explicitly state the legal principle that 'to establish actual occupation there must be a degree of continuity and permanence of occupation' as a standalone explanation or core legal point related to establishing the status itself. It uses the term 'continuous occupation' in the context of undermining an adverse possession claim, rather than defining the requirement for establishing occupation in general.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f0fffa23-151f-4433-8cbb-1f2067b841d8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1250, "completion_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 1429}, "latency_s": 0.8706085419980809, "request_id": "BCOVaYeGMa7pnsEP2M6v6QU", "raw_response": null}
