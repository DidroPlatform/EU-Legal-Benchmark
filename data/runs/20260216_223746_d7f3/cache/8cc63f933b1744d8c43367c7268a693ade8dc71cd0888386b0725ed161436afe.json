The candidate answer correctly identifies shared liability and discusses the owner's duty to coordinate and the inadequacy of the FRA, but it does not explicitly state the condition required by the rubric: that the owner's blame would be *equal* to the tenant's *if* the report had mentioned electrical maintenance. Instead, it frames the tenant as having primary blame and the owner as having secondary liability based on the actual facts (the report *did not* mention PAT testing). Therefore, the specific conditional statement required by the rubric is not present.\", \"criterion_id\": \"182b94af-8003-4587-b1f7-70b8f5270bf1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3496, "completion_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 3704}, "latency_s": 0.9759485420072451, "request_id": "mvuUaYLfCOjpnsEP173biQg", "raw_response": null}
