The candidate answer addresses this by stating that the court will consider whether the arbitration clause gives exclusive jurisdiction and whether the tribunal is in a position to give an equivalent interim measure. It explicitly mentions that in borderline cases, the court may stay or refuse the injunction and direct parties to seek relief from the Singapore tribunal instead (Section 2.3, Section 3, Step 2, and Section 6, Fact Pattern 4). This directly covers the principle that the court defers jurisdiction/action when the seat is elsewhere and the tribunal can act.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f319b040-3157-48dd-bb9f-24ca01953844\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3895, "completion_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 4088}, "latency_s": 22.91453970805742, "request_id": "n-qUaeT4OYO2xN8P9c6FqA8", "raw_response": null}
