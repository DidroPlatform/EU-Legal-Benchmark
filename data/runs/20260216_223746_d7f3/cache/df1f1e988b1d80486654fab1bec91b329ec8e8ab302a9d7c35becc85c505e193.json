The candidate answer provides a suggested contractual addendum, but this addendum focuses on indemnification against HMRC claims and confirming EXW responsibility, not specifically capping liability to the value of a security deposit (which is typically relevant if the French company *was* acting as IOR or guarantor, which the structure explicitly tries to avoid). The suggested clause is: \\\"Buyer indemnifies Seller against all HMRC claims.\\\" This is a general indemnity, not a liability cap tied to a security deposit value.\", \"criterion_id\": \"49d7071d-f6c2-480a-9e08-bbf2ae6219a1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2312, "completion_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 2490}, "latency_s": 0.6801690420252271, "request_id": "ASeVabGqKoTensEP6bbt4Ac", "raw_response": null}
