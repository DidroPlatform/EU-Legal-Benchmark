This means:\n\n- You **must** be accompanied by a qualified driver (aged 21+, held a full licence for 3+ years)\n- You **must** display L plates\n- These rules apply regardless of any international licence you hold\n\n**If you drove unaccompanied on a provisional licence**, you could face:\n\n- Being charged with **driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence**\n- Potential **insurance invalidation** (most policies won't cover you outside your licence conditions)\n- **6-8 penalty points** and a **fine**\n- You likely wouldn't be *arrested* on the spot in most cases, but you could be **reported for prosecution** and your car could be **seized**\n\n## Regarding your international licence:\n\nWhether it's valid for driving in the UK depends on several factors - how long you've been resident in the UK, which country issued it, etc. If you've been resident long enough that you were required to exchange or take a UK test, it may no longer be valid here.\n\n**My strong advice**: Arrange a lift, take public transport, or call a taxi from Crewe. It's not worth the risk.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 47, "completion_tokens": 312, "total_tokens": 359}, "latency_s": 9.063789042003918, "request_id": "chatcmpl-e4189f2a-28be-4f9b-ae2b-4fcde951c7dc", "raw_response": null}
