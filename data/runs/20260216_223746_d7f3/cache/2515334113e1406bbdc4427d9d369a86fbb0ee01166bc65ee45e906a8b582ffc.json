The analysis covers corporate structuring, conflict-of-law considerations, tax optimization, regulatory filings, and relevant precedents.\n\n---\n\n## I. PRIMARY SEAT OF THE MERGER AND JURISDICTIONAL ARCHITECTURE\n\n### A. Recommendation: Brazil as the Primary Seat\n\nBrazil should serve as the merger's **primary seat** (*sede principal*) for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Substantive Economic Nexus**: The target is a Brazilian data analytics company; Brazil likely represents the largest revenue base and employee concentration among the three Latin American jurisdictions. Under the doctrine of *siège réel* (real seat), which influences civil-law jurisdictions across Latin America, the jurisdiction where effective management and principal economic activity occur should govern the corporate existence of the merged entity.\n\n2. **Regulatory Weight**: Brazil's corporate regulatory framework under **Lei 6.404/1976** (the Brazilian Corporations Law, or *Lei das S.A.*) is the most comprehensive and prescriptive of the three jurisdictions regarding mergers (*incorporação*, *fusão*, and *cisão*). The Brazilian Securities Commission (*Comissão de Valores Mobiliários* — CVM) and the Brazilian antitrust authority (*Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica* — CADE) impose the most rigorous filing and approval requirements.\n\n3. **Data Analytics Regulatory Environment**: Given that the target is a data analytics company, Brazil's **Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados** (LGPD — Lei 13.709/2018) creates the most demanding data protection compliance framework in the region, making it prudent to anchor governance where the most stringent data rules apply.\n\n4. **Tax Treaty Network and Holding Efficiency**: While Brazil's tax treaty network is narrower than Mexico's or Chile's, the combination of a Brazilian holding company (*holding pura* or *holding mista*) with the Luxembourg funding vehicle creates opportunities for treaty-based withholding tax reduction on dividends, interest, and royalties under the **Brazil-Luxembourg Double Tax Treaty** (Decree 10.133/2019, effective from 2019 based on the convention signed in 2018).\n\n### B. Proposed Structure\n\n```\nUS Technology Group (Delaware/Parent)\n        │\nLuxembourg S.à r.l. / S.A. (Funding Vehicle)\n        │\nBrazilian Holding S.A. (Primary Seat — NewCo Regional HQ)\n        ├── Brazilian Data Analytics Target (merged/incorporated)\n        ├── Chilean Subsidiary (SpA or S.A.)\n        └── Mexican Subsidiary (S.A. de C.V. or S. de R.L. de C.V.)\n```\n\n---\n\n## II. CONFLICT-OF-LAW CONSIDERATIONS AMONG BRAZIL, CHILE, AND MEXICO\n\n### A. Governing Principles\n\nEach jurisdiction follows a variation of the **lex societatis** doctrine — the law of the place of incorporation governs the internal affairs of a corporation — but with important nuances:\n\n#### 1. Brazil\n- **Lei de Introdução às Normas do Direito Brasileiro (LINDB — Decreto-Lei 4.657/1942)**, Article 11: Legal entities are governed by the law of the state where they are constituted (*constituídas*). However, Article 11, §1 requires that foreign legal entities operating in Brazil obtain authorization from the Brazilian government, and their Brazilian operations are subject to Brazilian law regardless of the law of incorporation.\n- **Practical Effect**: Any subsidiary or branch operating in Brazil must comply fully with Lei 6.404/1976 for corporate governance matters, and the merger of the Brazilian target will be governed exclusively by Brazilian law.\n\n#### 2. Mexico\n- **Ley General de Sociedades Mercantiles (LGSM)**, published in the *Diario Oficial de la Federación* on August 4, 1934 (as amended): Mexico follows the incorporation theory. Article 251 of the LGSM requires foreign companies to obtain authorization from the *Secretaría de Economía* to operate in Mexico. The internal affairs of a Mexican subsidiary (e.g., an S.A. de C.V.) are governed by the LGSM and the *Código de Comercio*.\n- **Conflict Rule**: Mexico's *Código Civil Federal*, Article 2736, provides that the legal existence, capacity, functioning, and dissolution of foreign legal entities are governed by the law of their constitution, but activities in Mexico are subject to Mexican law.\n\n#### 3. Chile\n- **Ley 18.046 (Ley sobre Sociedades Anónimas)** — *Note: The question references \"Ley 28.046,\" which does not exist in Chilean legislation. The correct reference is Ley 18.046, published October 22, 1981, as amended, which governs corporations (sociedades anónimas) in Chile.* Chile also follows the incorporation doctrine. Foreign companies must register with the *Registro de Comercio* and comply with Chilean law for local operations.\n- **Ley 20.382 (2009)** amended Ley 18.046 to strengthen corporate governance, particularly for publicly traded companies.\n- **Conflict Rule**: Chile's *Código de Derecho Internacional Privado* (Bustamante Code, ratified by Chile) and domestic private international law principles provide that the law of incorporation governs internal corporate affairs, but Chilean mandatory rules (*normas de orden público*) apply to operations within Chilean territory.\n\n### B. Key Conflict-of-Law Issues\n\n| Issue | Applicable Rule | Practical Implication |\n|-------|----------------|----------------------|\n| **Corporate form of merged entity** | Lex societatis of the primary seat (Brazil) | NewCo must be a Brazilian S.A. under Lei 6.404/1976 |\n| **Shareholder rights in subsidiaries** | Law of each subsidiary's incorporation | Chilean subsidiary governed by Ley 18.046; Mexican subsidiary by LGSM |\n| **Cross-border asset transfers** | Law of the situs of the asset + law of the transferring entity | Real property in Chile governed by Chilean law; IP registered in Mexico governed by Mexican law |\n| **Contractual obligations** | Party autonomy (choice of law) subject to local mandatory rules | Merger agreement can designate governing law (e.g., New York or Brazilian law) but local mandatory provisions override |\n| **Employment matters** | Mandatory application of local labor law | Brazilian CLT, Mexican LFT, Chilean Código del Trabajo — no derogation possible |\n| **Regulatory approvals** | Each jurisdiction's mandatory filing requirements | Antitrust and data protection filings required in each country independently |\n\n### C. The Bustamante Code and Inter-American Conventions\n\nBrazil, Chile, and Mexico are parties to various **Inter-American Conventions on Private International Law** (CIDIPs). While Brazil ratified the **Bustamante Code (1928)** with reservations, and Chile ratified it more broadly, Mexico has generally preferred bilateral treaties and the CIDIP framework. For this transaction:\n\n- The **Inter-American Convention on the Law Applicable to International Contracts (Mexico City, 1994)** — CIDIP-V — may apply to the merger agreement if the parties choose, though Brazil has not ratified it. Mexico and Chile have.\n- In practice, the parties should include a **governing law clause** in the merger agreement (likely Brazilian law for the primary merger, with subsidiary-specific agreements governed by local law) and an **arbitration clause** (ICC or ICDR arbitration seated in São Paulo or New York).\n\n---\n\n## III. APPLICATION OF CORPORATE LAWS TO CROSS-BORDER CONSOLIDATION\n\n### A. Brazil: Lei 6.404/1976 (Lei das Sociedades por Ações)\n\n#### 1. Relevant Merger Mechanisms\n\nLei 6.404/1976 provides three forms of corporate combination:\n\n- **Incorporação (Absorption Merger)** — Articles 227: One company absorbs another, which ceases to exist. The surviving company succeeds to all rights and obligations. *This is the most likely mechanism for absorbing the Brazilian data analytics target into NewCo.*\n\n- **Fusão (True Merger/Consolidation)** — Articles 228: Two or more companies merge to form an entirely new entity, with all predecessor companies ceasing to exist. *This could apply if both the US group's Brazilian subsidiary and the target merge to form NewCo.*\n\n- **Cisão (Spin-off/Demerger)** — Articles 229: A company transfers portions of its assets to one or more existing or new companies. *This may be used to carve out the US group's Latin American operations from its existing Brazilian subsidiary.*\n\n#### 2. Procedural Requirements\n\n- **Protocol and Justification (*Protocolo e Justificação*)** — Article 224-225: The boards of directors (or managing officers) of the merging companies must negotiate and execute a merger protocol setting forth the terms, including the exchange ratio, valuation methodology, and treatment of dissenting shareholders. A separate justification document must explain the economic rationale.\n\n- **Appraisal (*Avaliação do Patrimônio Líquido*)** — Article 226: The net assets of the company being absorbed must be appraised by three independent experts or a specialized firm. The appraisal can be at book value, market value, or net asset value, but CVM Instruction 319/1999 (now superseded by CVM Resolution 78/2022 for publicly traded companies) requires fair value appraisals for related-party transactions.\n\n- **Shareholder Approval** — Article 227, §1: The shareholders' meeting (*assembleia geral*) of each company must approve the merger by the quorum established in the bylaws (for an S.A., typically a majority of voting shares present, with a quorum of at least 2/3 of voting shares for first call in certain cases under Article 136).\n\n- **Dissenting Shareholder Rights (*Direito de Recesso*)** — Article 230 and 137: Shareholders who dissent from the merger have the right to withdraw and receive reimbursement for their shares, calculated based on the equity value per the last approved balance sheet (or at economic value if the bylaws so provide or if the company is publicly traded under certain conditions).\n\n- **Creditor Protection** — Article 232: Creditors have 60 days from publication of the merger acts to judicially oppose the merger if they can demonstrate prejudice. However, this does not suspend the merger's effectiveness.\n\n- **Registration**: The merger must be filed with the *Junta Comercial* (Commercial Registry) of the state where the surviving entity is headquartered, and published in the *Diário Oficial* and a major newspaper.\n\n#### 3. CVM Requirements (if applicable)\n\nIf either merging entity is publicly traded or registered with CVM:\n- **CVM Resolution 78/2022** (replacing CVM Instruction 319/1999 and CVM Instruction 565/2015): Requires independent committee evaluation for related-party mergers, enhanced disclosure, and specific valuation methodologies.\n- **Tender offer obligations** may arise under CVM Resolution 85/2022 if the transaction triggers a change of control of a publicly traded company.\n\n#### 4. Foreign Investment Registration\n\nThe Luxembourg vehicle's investment in the Brazilian holding must be registered with the **Central Bank of Brazil (BCB)** through the **RDE-IED (Registro Declaratório Eletrônico — Investimento Estrangeiro Direto)** system, pursuant to **Lei 4.131/1962** and **BCB Resolution 278/2022**. This registration is essential for future profit repatriation and capital repatriation.\n\n### B. Mexico: Ley General de Sociedades Mercantiles (LGSM)\n\n#### 1. Relevant Merger Mechanisms\n\n- **Fusión (Merger)** — Articles 222-226 LGSM: Mexican law recognizes merger by absorption (*fusión por incorporación*) and merger by creation of a new entity (*fusión por integración*). The surviving or new entity assumes all rights and obligations of the merged companies.\n\n#### 2. Procedural Requirements\n\n- **Merger Agreement (*Convenio de Fusión*)**: Must be approved by the shareholders' meeting (*asamblea general extraordinaria de accionistas*) of each participating company, requiring the extraordinary quorum under Article 190 LGSM (75% of share capital represented for S.A., resolutions by vote of shares representing at least 50% of capital).\n\n- **Balance Sheet Approval**: Each merging company must prepare and approve a balance sheet as of the merger date.\n\n- **Publication and Creditor Protection** — Article 223 LGSM: The merger agreement must be registered with the *Registro Público de Comercio* and published in the *Diario Oficial de la Federación* (or the official gazette of the relevant state) and in a newspaper of wide circulation. Creditors have **three months** from the last publication to oppose the merger judicially. The merger cannot take effect until this period expires, unless: (a) all debts are paid; (b) deposits covering all debts are made with a credit institution; or (c) all creditors consent.\n\n- **Foreign Investment Considerations**: Under the **Ley de Inversión Extranjera (LIE)** and its regulations, the acquisition of Mexican assets by foreign entities may require notification to the *Comisión Nacional de Inversiones Extranjeras (CNIE)* if certain thresholds are met (currently approximately MXN 4,131 million in total asset value, adjusted annually). Technology and data analytics are generally not restricted sectors under the LIE, but verification is required.\n\n- **Tax ID and Registration**: The surviving entity must update its registration with the *Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT)* and comply with the *Código Fiscal de la Federación* regarding tax succession.\n\n#### 3. Specific Considerations for S.A. de C.V. vs. S. de R.L. de C.V.\n\nIf the Mexican subsidiary is structured as an **S. de R.L. de C.V.** (limited liability company), the LGSM provisions on *sociedades de responsabilidad limitada* (Articles 58-86) apply, with different quorum and consent requirements. The S. de R.L. de C.V. is often preferred for wholly-owned subsidiaries due to its flexibility and the ability to include specific provisions in the *estatutos sociales* regarding transfer restrictions and governance.\n\n### C. Chile: Ley 18.046 (Ley sobre Sociedades Anónimas)\n\n#### 1. Clarification on \"Ley 28.046\"\n\nAs noted, the reference to \"Ley 28.046\" appears to be erroneous. The governing statute for Chilean corporations is **Ley 18.046** (October 22, 1981, as amended), supplemented by its regulations (**Decreto Supremo 702 de Hacienda, Reglamento de Sociedades Anónimas**). For limited liability companies (*sociedades de responsabilidad limitada*), **Ley 3.918** applies. For the simplified stock company (*Sociedad por Acciones* — SpA), **Articles 424-446 of the Código de Comercio** (introduced by Ley 20.190 of 2007) govern.\n\n#### 2. Merger Mechanisms under Ley 18.046\n\n- **Fusión (Merger)** — Articles 99-100 of Ley 18.046:\n  - **Fusión por creación**: Two or more companies dissolve and form a new entity that succeeds to all rights and obligations.\n  - **Fusión por incorporación (absorción)**: One or more companies are dissolved and absorbed by an existing company, which succeeds to all rights and obligations.\n\n- Article 99 defines merger as the reunion of two or more companies into a single entity that succeeds to all rights and obligations.\n\n#### 3. Procedural Requirements\n\n- **Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting (*Junta Extraordinaria de Accionistas*)** — Article 57 of Ley 18.046: Merger requires approval by 2/3 of the outstanding voting shares (not merely those present).\n\n- **Dissenting Shareholder Rights (*Derecho a Retiro*)** — Article 69: Shareholders who vote against the merger or who are absent from the meeting have the right to withdraw and receive payment for their shares at book value (or as otherwise provided in the bylaws for SpAs).\n\n- **Appraisal**: While Ley 18.046 does not mandate an independent appraisal with the same specificity as Brazilian law, the **Superintendencia de Valores y Seguros** (now the **Comisión para el Mercado Financiero — CMF**, established by Ley 21.000 of 2017) requires fair valuation disclosures for publicly traded companies.\n\n- **Registration and Publication**: The merger must be formalized by public deed (*escritura pública*), an extract must be registered with the *Registro de Comercio* of the relevant *Conservador de Bienes Raíces*, and published in the *", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 240, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 4336}, "latency_s": 84.20879299999797, "request_id": "chatcmpl-dabe75f3-6f41-4345-97d3-aaf07a8fab02", "raw_response": null}
