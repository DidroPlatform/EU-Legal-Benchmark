The candidate answer discusses Section 44(5) of the Arbitration Act 1996, stating the court shall act only if the tribunal has no power or is unable to act effectively. It also mentions urgency as a factor favoring intervention. However, it does not explicitly state the condition that permission from the tribunal/emergency arbitrator/written agreement is required when urgency is not the primary driver, which is a specific requirement often associated with the court's power under Section 44(3) (which deals with court powers in support of arbitration generally, distinct from the 'inability to act' test in s.44(5) for interim measures). The answer focuses heavily on the 'inability to act effectively' test (s.44(5)) and urgency, but fails to mention the specific permission requirement mentioned in the criterion, which relates to the court's general power under s.44(3) when the tribunal *can* act but the court is asked to intervene.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f1109ec9-915b-49cf-8602-e1a2f2a99b4b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2282, "completion_tokens": 300, "total_tokens": 2582}, "latency_s": 1.1973230419971514, "request_id": "Tb2UaZyiIdy8nsEPjZySgAU", "raw_response": null}
