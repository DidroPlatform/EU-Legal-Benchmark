The analysis correctly relies on the principle established in cases like *Moore Stephens v. Stone & Rolls Ltd* (cited in the reference answer) that the defense requires the *claimant* (Digital Assets Ltd) to be implicated in the illegality, which is not the case here as the company is the victim of the director's actions. The reference answer focuses heavily on the presence of innocent shareholders (Eden Sharehan) as a reason to defeat the defense, which is a strong supporting point, although the primary reason is that the company itself was not the wrongdoer. The candidate answer correctly identifies the distinction between the company being the wrongdoer versus being the victim of a director's fraud, and correctly dismisses the defense based on public policy and the nature of the claim (negligence vs. participation in illegality). The candidate answer is more detailed and cites relevant English case law (*Safeway Stores plc v Twigger*, *Barclays Bank plc v Grant Thornton UK LLP*), strengthening the conclusion. The candidate answer correctly dismisses the irrelevant Swiss law reference. The conclusion aligns perfectly with the reference answer's outcome.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.95}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1693, "completion_tokens": 306, "total_tokens": 1999}, "latency_s": 1.375258208019659, "request_id": "kuSUaee2A7_ZvdIPnLOGmAU", "raw_response": null}
