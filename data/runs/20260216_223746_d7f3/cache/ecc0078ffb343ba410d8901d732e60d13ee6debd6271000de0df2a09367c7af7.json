The Wildtierpark covers 2,300 m² across two parcels. Parcel 711 is in a building zone (but forested), and parcel 714 is in a forest area. The key question is whether setting up a wildlife park with a 3m fence constitutes a 'Rodung' (forest clearing). Under Swiss forest law (WaG), a Rodungsbewilligung is needed when forest is permanently or temporarily converted to non-forest use. A wildlife park with fencing on forested land where trees remain standing and are protected from browsing (through feeding) does not necessarily constitute a Rodung - the forest character is maintained. The trees remain, and the use is compatible with forest purposes (wildlife care and rewilding). Under Art. 4 WaG, installations that don't change the forest character may not require a Rodungsbewilligung. So statement i appears to be FALSE - no Rodungsbewilligung is necessarily required.\\n\\n**Statement ii:** The claim is that Art. 19 Abs. 1 AbfallR complies with the USG (Umweltschutzgesetz). Under Art. 32a USG, waste fees must be 'verursachergerecht' (polluter-pays principle). A Grundgebühr based solely on the building insurance value (Gebäudeversicherungswert) is a common approach, but the USG requires that fees be predominantly usage-based (verursachergerecht). The Grundgebühr based on building value has been accepted by Swiss courts as a permissible component, but it must be proportionate. However, the statement says the Grundgebühr of 0.1‰ of building value corresponds to USG requirements. Given that B previously paid Fr. 100 Grundgebühr + Fr. 600 Sackgebühren = Fr. 700 total, the Grundgebühr represents about 14% of total fees, which is within acceptable bounds. Actually, the question asks whether Art. 19 Abs. 1 meets USG requirements - a pure value-based Grundgebühr without any connection to actual waste production can be problematic under the Verursacherprinzip, but Swiss courts have generally accepted moderate Grundgebühren. The statement that it corresponds to USG requirements could be considered correct or debatable. But the more important issue: the Grundgebühr applies to buildings with living/working spaces or where waste regularly accumulates (Abs. 2). A closed hotel arguably still contains 'Arbeitsräume' even if not in use. This seems like a reasonable application. However, the statement specifically says Art. 19 Abs. 1 corresponds to USG - this is the assertion being evaluated. A Grundgebühr based purely on Neuwert without any usage component could violate the Verursacherprinzip if it's too high relative to variable fees. But given the proportions here, it seems acceptable. Statement ii's claim seems potentially FALSE because a purely value-based Grundgebühr may not fully comply with Verursacherprinzip.\\n\\n**Statement iii:** UVP-Pflicht for a hydropower plant. Under the UVPV (Anhang), hydropower plants with a capacity of more than 3 MW are UVP-pflichtig. The planned facility has only 0.6 MW, which is well below the 3 MW threshold. Therefore, the statement that the facility is UVP-pflichtig is FALSE.\\n\\nAll three statements appear to be false, making the answer C.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1431, "completion_tokens": 860, "total_tokens": 2291}, "latency_s": 19.57875829198747, "request_id": "chatcmpl-712f0135-2539-4aca-9d55-722be704900b", "raw_response": null}
