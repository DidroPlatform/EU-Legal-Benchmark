{"provider": "bedrock", "model": "bedrock/converse/openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0", "text": "**TL;DR** –  \n1. **Identify the claim** (e.g., possession, rent arrears, breach of covenant).  \n2. **File a defence** within the time‑limit (usually 14 days) and set out the facts and the evidence you have.  \n3. **Gather documentary and testimonial proof** that you have paid rent on time, complied with the tenancy agreement and that the landlord’s allegations are unfounded.  \n4. **Ask the court for costs** (and, where appropriate, damages for wrongful eviction or malicious prosecution) if the landlord’s case is frivolous or dishonest.  \n\nBelow is a step‑by‑step guide to what you can do, the evidence you should collect, the legal arguments you can raise, and the possible consequences for a landlord who brings a baseless claim in England and Wales.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What kind of claim is the landlord making?\n\n| Common landlord claim | What it means | Typical evidence the landlord will try to produce |\n|----------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Possession (Section 8 or Section 21 notice)** | Landlord wants you to leave the property. | Notice copy, rent ledger, breach of covenant letters, inventory, “break‑and‑enter” photos. |\n| **Rent arrears / non‑payment** | Claim you owe rent (or other sums). | Rent ledger, bank statements, receipts, tenancy agreement. |\n| **Breach of covenant (e.g., sub‑letting, pet, damage)** | Claim you have violated a term of the tenancy. | Correspondence, inspection reports, photographs, witness statements. |\n| **Damages for disrepair / compensation** | Landlord says you caused damage or failed to maintain the property. | Inventory, condition reports, repair invoices, photographs. |\n\n**First step:** read the claim form (N1) and particulars of claim carefully. It will tell you exactly what the landlord alleges and on what legal basis (e.g., “the tenant is in arrears of £2 500 under the tenancy agreement dated …”).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Responding – filing a defence (and possibly a counter‑claim)\n\n1. **Time‑limit:** You normally have **14 days** from the date the claim form is served to file a defence (or to apply for an extension). Missing the deadline can lead to a default judgment against you.\n\n2. **How to file:**  \n   * Use **Form N9** (Defence) – you can download it from the HM Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS) website.  \n   * State **each allegation** and whether you **admit, deny or partially admit** it.  \n   * Set out the **facts** that support your position and **list the evidence** you will rely on (see Section 3).  \n   * If you have a **counter‑claim** (e.g., for unlawful eviction, breach of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, or malicious prosecution), you can include it in the same form or file a separate **Form N9A**.\n\n3. **Service:** Send the completed defence to the court (by post or online via the Money Claim Online system) and a copy to the landlord’s solicitor.\n\n4. **Request for a “case management conference”** (CMC) – the judge will give directions on the timetable, disclosure, and whether the matter can be settled by mediation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence you should gather\n\n| Category | Why it matters | Typical documents / proof |\n|----------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| **Rent payment** | Shows you have met the core obligation of the tenancy. | • Bank statements showing rent transfers (or standing order confirmations). <br>• Receipts or rent book entries. <br>• Correspondence confirming receipt of rent (e.g., email “Rent of £X received on 1 May”). |\n| **Tenancy agreement & any variations** | Defines the parties’ rights and duties. | • Original signed tenancy agreement. <br>• Any written amendments, addenda, or “letter of variation”. |\n| **Condition reports / inventory** | Demonstrates the state of the property when you moved in and when you left. | • Check‑in inventory (signed by both parties). <br>• Photographs or video taken at start‑ and end‑of‑tenancy. |\n| **Correspondence with the landlord** | Shows you raised any issues promptly and complied with notice requirements. | • Emails, letters, text messages (keep originals or screenshots). <br>• Records of any complaints and the landlord’s responses. |\n| **Repair & maintenance records** | Proves you reported disrepair (landlord’s duty under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985) and that you did not cause damage. | • Copies of repair request letters/emails. <br>• Photographs of the defect before and after repair. <br>• Invoices/receipts from contractors. |\n| **Witness statements** | Independent corroboration of your version. | • Statements from house‑mates, neighbours, or friends who can attest to your payment habits or the condition of the property. |\n| **Proof of compliance with other covenants** | Refutes allegations such as unauthorised sub‑letting, keeping pets, or smoking. | • Photographs, utility bills (showing only one occupant), or a declaration of compliance. |\n| **Legal notices** | Demonstrates you received (or did not receive) any required notice. | • Copy of the Section 21/8 notice (if any). <br>• Proof of service (e.g., recorded delivery receipt). |\n| **Court‑related documents** | Needed for cost orders and any injunctions. | • Any previous court orders (e.g., a protection order). |\n\n**Tip:** Keep a **chronological “evidence binder”** (digital or paper) with a table of contents, dates, and a short description of each document. This makes it far easier to locate items during disclosure or at trial.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Legal arguments you can raise (defences)\n\n### 4.1. **No rent arrears / rent paid**\n\n* **Statutory basis:** Under the **Housing Act 1988** (as amended) the tenant’s primary covenant is to pay rent. If you can prove payment, the landlord’s claim for possession on the ground of rent arrears fails (see *Knightsbridge Estates Ltd v Byrne* [1970] 1 WLR 1159).\n\n### 4.2. **Improper notice**\n\n* A Section 21 notice must be **served at least 2 months before** the possession hearing and must comply with the **“Section 21 checklist”** (e.g., deposit protection, EPC, gas safety certificate). If any requirement is missing, the notice is invalid (see *Spencer v Taylor* [2021] EWCA Civ 1245).\n\n### 4.3. **Landlord’s breach of statutory duties**\n\n* **Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, s.11** – duty to keep the property in repair. Failure can be a defence to possession (e.g., *Miller v. R. & J. R. Ltd* [2015] EWCA Civ 1155).  \n* **Protection from Eviction Act 1977** – unlawful eviction or harassment is a civil claim for damages and an injunction.\n\n### 4.4. **Procedural irregularities**\n\n* **Improper service** of the claim form or notice.  \n* **Failure to disclose** documents (the landlord must disclose the rent ledger, etc., under the Civil Procedure Rules Part 31). Non‑disclosure can lead to a **costs order** against the landlord.\n\n### 4.5. **Counter‑claim for damages**\n\n* **Wrongful eviction / harassment** – you may claim **statutory damages up to £5,000** plus any loss (e.g., moving costs).  \n* **Malicious prosecution** – if the landlord knew the claim was baseless and proceeded anyway, you could claim damages for injury to reputation and any financial loss (see *Baker v. Farrant* [1995] 1 All ER 117). This is a high bar: you must prove *(i)* the claim was brought without reasonable cause, *and* *(ii)* malice.\n\n---\n\n## 5. What can happen to a landlord who brings a baseless claim?\n\n| Potential consequence | When it applies | Effect |\n|-----------------------|----------------|--------|\n| **Award of costs** | The court finds the claim “unreasonable” or “without merit”. | The landlord must pay your solicitor’s fees and any other costs (subject to the usual “proportionate” test). |\n| **Sanctions for non‑compliance** | Failure to disclose documents, or to attend a case management conference. | The court can **strike out** the claim, **enter a default judgment** for you, or impose **cost sanctions** (CPR 31.6). |\n| **Damages for wrongful eviction / harassment** | Landlord evicts or harasses you in breach of the Protection from Eviction Act 1977. | Up to **£5,000** statutory damages plus any actual loss (e.g., relocation costs). |\n| **Compensation for loss of enjoyment / inconvenience** | If the landlord’s conduct caused you to suffer loss (e.g., you had to move out temporarily). | Court may award **additional damages** (case‑by‑case). |\n| **Malicious prosecution / abuse of process** | Proven that the landlord knew the claim was false and pursued it to harass you. | **Damages** (often modest, but can include aggravated damages) and **costs**. |\n| **Regulatory action** | Serious breaches (e.g., failure to protect deposit, illegal eviction). | Local authority or the **Housing Ombudsman** can issue fines, order the landlord to remedy the breach, or even ban the landlord from letting. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The most common and immediate consequence for a landlord who “wins” a frivolous claim is that **they will be ordered to pay your legal costs**. If the claim is found to be an abuse of process, the court may also award **damages**.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Practical steps you should take **right now**\n\n1. **Read the claim form carefully** – note the deadline for filing a defence.  \n2. **Contact a solicitor or a free‑legal‑advice service** (Citizens Advice, Shelter, Law Centres, or the Bar Pro Bono Scheme). Even a short “initial advice” call can save you from procedural missteps.  \n3. **Start a dedicated “tenancy folder”** (digital is fine). Scan every relevant document and label it clearly (e.g., “2023‑05‑01‑Bank‑Statement‑Rent‑Transfer.pdf”).  \n4. **Prepare a timeline** of key events (move‑in date, rent payment dates, any complaints, notices received). This helps both you and any solicitor see the story at a glance.  \n5. **If you have a Section 21 notice**, verify that the landlord complied with the **“Section 21 checklist”** (deposit protection, EPC, gas safety, “How to Rent” guide, etc.). If anything is missing, note it – it may render the notice invalid.  \n6. **Consider mediation** – many county courts will encourage parties to settle before a full trial. If you have a strong factual case, a settlement can avoid the cost and stress of a hearing.  \n7. **If you are being threatened with eviction**, you can apply for an **interim injunction** (or a “stay of possession”) to stop the landlord from taking steps until the case is decided. This is done via **Form N208** (Application for an injunction).  \n8. **Keep a record of any harassment** (phone calls, letters, visits). This can support a claim under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977.  \n\n---\n\n## 7. Sample “evidence checklist” you can copy‑paste\n\n```\n□ Tenancy agreement (original signed copy)\n□ Deposit protection certificate / tenancy deposit scheme (TDS) statement\n□ EPC, Gas Safety Certificate, Energy Performance Certificate\n□ All rent payment evidence (bank statements, standing order confirmations, receipts)\n□ Check‑in inventory & photographs (dated)\n□ Check‑out inventory & photographs (dated)\n□ All written correspondence with landlord (emails, letters, texts)\n□ Copies of any Section 21/8 notices received (including proof of service)\n□ Records of repair requests (emails, letters) and landlord’s responses\n□ Photographs of any disrepair before and after repair\n□ Witness statements (if any)\n□ Proof of compliance with other covenants (e.g., pet licence, sub‑letting consent)\n□ Any previous court orders or judgments relating to this tenancy\n□ Notes of any harassment or intimidation (date, time, content, witness)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Short answer |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Do I have to go to court?** | Not if the landlord agrees to settle, but you must **file a defence** to avoid a default judgment. |\n| **Can I get my legal costs back?** | Yes, if you win (or the claim is struck out). The court will usually order the landlord to pay your **reasonable costs**. |\n| **What if the landlord never served a proper notice?** | The possession claim will likely fail; you can ask the judge to **dismiss** the claim and award costs. |\n| **Is there a time limit for me to bring a counter‑claim?** | Counter‑claims are usually filed with the defence, so they are covered by the same deadline. |\n| **Can I stay in the property while the case is ongoing?** | Yes, unless the court grants a possession order. You can also apply for an **injunction** to stop any unlawful eviction attempts. |\n| **What if the landlord is a corporate entity?** | The same rules apply; you can seek a **cost order** against the company and, where appropriate, its directors for “wrongful” conduct. |\n| **Do I need a solicitor?** | Not strictly required, but a solicitor (or a qualified legal adviser) can ensure you meet procedural rules and maximise your chance of success. |\n\n---\n\n## 9.
