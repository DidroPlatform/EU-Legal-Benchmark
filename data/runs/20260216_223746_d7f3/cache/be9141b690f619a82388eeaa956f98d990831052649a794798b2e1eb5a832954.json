Applicable legal framework**\n\n1. **Duty of care of the auditor**  \n   – Art. 727a Abs. 1 lit. a CO imposes on the statutory auditor a duty of care towards the company, its shareholders and its creditors.  \n   – The auditor is liable for damage caused by a breach of this duty (Art. 727a Abs. 2 CO).\n\n2. **Ex turpi causa (illegality defence)**  \n   – The principle that a claim arising from an illegal act may be barred is part of Swiss private‑law doctrine (see Art. 2 ZGB – “no one may obtain a right from an illegal act”).  \n   – The Federal Supreme Court has clarified that the defence is available only when the *claim* itself is founded on the plaintiff’s own illegal conduct (BGE 4A_111/2009, 23 Juli 2009).\n\n3. **Good‑faith requirement**  \n   – Art. 41 CO requires parties to act in good faith; a claim that is “tainted” by the plaintiff’s own fraud may be excluded, but only where the plaintiff is the perpetrator of the illegality.\n\n**II.  Whether the liquidator can rely on ex turpi causa**\n\n| Element | Requirement under Swiss law | Application to the present case |\n|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **(a) The plaintiff must be the one who committed the illegal act** | Art. 2 ZGB and BGE 4A_111/2009 require that the *claimant* is the party whose conduct is illegal. | The liquidator (representing the insolvent estate) is not the person who produced the fraudulent accounts; the illegal act was committed by Achille Taloon, the director. |\n| **(b) The claim must be based on the illegal act** | The defence bars a claim that is the *direct* result of the plaintiff’s wrongdoing. | The liquidator’s claim is based on an alleged breach of the auditor’s statutory duty of care (negligent audit), not on the director’s fraud. The loss suffered by the estate is attributed to the auditor’s alleged negligence, not to the plaintiff’s own conduct. |\n| **(c) No public policy reason to deny the defence** | Even where the plaintiff is not the wrongdoer, the defence may be invoked only if allowing the claim would contravene public policy. | Allowing the liquidator to recover from the auditor furthers the protection of creditors and shareholders, a legitimate public‑policy objective. Hence public policy does not preclude the claim. |\n\n**III.  Likelihood of success of the defence**\n\n1. **The liquidator is not the illegal actor** – Because the alleged illegality (over‑statement of assets) was committed by the director, the ex turpi causa defence cannot be invoked against a claim brought by the liquidator. The defence is unavailable where the plaintiff is innocent of the wrongdoing (BGE 4A_111/2009, para. 3).\n\n2. **The claim is founded on the auditor’s own alleged breach** – Under Art. 727a CO the auditor may be held liable for negligent audit work irrespective of the director’s fraud. The auditor’s liability is *independent* of the director’s misconduct; therefore the claim is not “derived” from the illegal act of the plaintiff.\n\n3. **Good‑faith and public‑policy considerations** – The purpose of Art. 727a CO is to protect the estate of a bankrupt company and its creditors. Excluding the auditor’s liability on the ground of ex turpi causa would undermine this protective scheme and is contrary to the policy underlying the auditor’s statutory liability.\n\n**IV.  Conclusion**\n\nGiven the above analysis, P&L Audit Ltd will **not** be able to defeat Digital Assets Ltd (in liquidation)’s claim of breach of duty of care by invoking the ex turpi causa defence. The defence is unavailable because:\n\n* the plaintiff (the liquidator) is not the party who committed the illegal act; and  \n* the claim is predicated on the auditor’s alleged negligence, not on the director’s fraud.\n\nAccordingly, the liquidator may pursue the auditor’s liability under Art. 727a CO, and the ex turpi causa defence is expected to be rejected by the courts.\n\n**V.  Missing factual material (for a fully conclusive answer)**  \n\n* Whether P&L Audit Ltd was aware, or ought to have been aware, of the director’s intentional over‑statement at the time of the audit (knowledge of fraud may affect the standard of care).  \n* The exact terms of the audit engagement (e.g., any limitation of liability clause).  \n* Whether any statutory or contractual time‑bars (Art. 127 CO – limitation periods) have expired.  \n\nIn the absence of contrary facts, the above conclusion remains the best‑qualified answer under current Swiss law.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 447, "completion_tokens": 1639, "total_tokens": 2086}, "latency_s": 7.409289292001631, "request_id": "chatcmpl-4f1fd6c0-6ddc-46ff-a65f-6a1b51dac3ba", "raw_response": null}
