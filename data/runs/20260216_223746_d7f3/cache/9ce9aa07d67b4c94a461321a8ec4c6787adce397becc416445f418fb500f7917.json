The reference answer lists A, B, C, and E as correct, and D is implicitly incorrect as it is omitted from the correct list. The candidate's assessment for D and E contradicts the reference answer, leading to a lower score. Specifically, E is factually correct in the reference context, but the candidate marked it incorrect. D is factually incorrect as the candidate marked it incorrect when it should have been marked incorrect (omitted from the correct list). The candidate's analysis of D is factually wrong based on the reference's implicit stance (D is not correct). The candidate's analysis of E is factually wrong based on the reference's explicit stance (E is correct).\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.6}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1610, "completion_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 1845}, "latency_s": 1.0293436249776278, "request_id": "wMaUaaviBNrOnsEPw-rG0AM", "raw_response": null}
