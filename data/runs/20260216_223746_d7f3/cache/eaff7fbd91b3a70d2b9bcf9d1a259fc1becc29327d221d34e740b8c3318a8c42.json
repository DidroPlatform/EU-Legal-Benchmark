It does not state the specific exemption for distributions to foreign shareholders under Brazilian domestic law, which is a key point often cited in structuring advice (i.e., dividends paid by a Brazilian company to a resident or non-resident shareholder are generally exempt from Brazilian WHT under current domestic law, provided the recipient is not resident in a tax haven).
