The candidate answer discusses Article V(1)(e) under the heading 'Anticipated Article V Defences & How to Counter Them' but incorrectly states that the supplier's public policy argument (V(1)(e)) is based on the French injunction, which is a procedural matter, not a ground for setting aside the award under V(1)(e). Crucially, the response *fails* to mention the actual ground for refusal under Article V(1)(e), which is that the award has been 'set aside by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made.' Since the core element of the criterion (identifying the 'set aside' provision of V(1)(e)) is missing, the criterion is not satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4e27ec7e-c6c3-4702-94e3-c62fdc7b481d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2654, "completion_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 2907}, "latency_s": 0.9535309579805471, "request_id": "HOuUabi0AvCMkdUPpaWNwAE", "raw_response": null}
