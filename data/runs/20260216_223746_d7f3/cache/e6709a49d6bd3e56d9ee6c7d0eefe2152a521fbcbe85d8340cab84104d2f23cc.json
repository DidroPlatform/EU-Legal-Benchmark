In practice tribunals apply a three‑step jurisdictional test:\n\n1. **Consent** – Has the state consented (expressly, by implication, or by a “general reservation”) to arbitration of the type of claim it is making?  \n2. **Connection / “same transaction” test** – Is the counter‑claim sufficiently linked to the investor’s claim (same contract, same underlying facts, same legal relationship)?  \n3. **Applicable law** – Does the treaty (or the arbitration agreement) provide a substantive basis for the state’s claim (e.g., breach of the BIT’s substantive obligations, or an “umbrella clause” that pulls in domestic law breaches)?\n\nBelow is a step‑by‑step walk‑through of each element, the principal authorities, and a quick‑reference table of the most‑cited cases where tribunals **accepted** or **rejected** host‑state counter‑claims.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The consent requirement\n\n| **Source of consent** | **How tribunals have interpreted it** | **Key cases** |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|\n| **Express consent** (a BIT clause that expressly allows the host‑state to bring a counter‑claim) | Straightforward – the tribunal will accept the claim if the other jurisdictional tests are met. | *CMS Energy v. Argentina* (ICSID ARB/00/5) – BIT expressly permitted “any dispute arising out of the investment” and the tribunal accepted the state’s counter‑claim. |\n| **Implied consent** (the BIT is silent, but the language is broad – e.g., “any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement”) | Tribunals look for a “general reservation” that the parties intended to submit **all** disputes relating to the investment to arbitration.  The test is whether the state could have reasonably expected its claim to be arbitrable. | *Saluka v. Czech Republic* (ICSID ARB/03/5) – the tribunal found that the BIT’s “any dispute” wording did **not** automatically cover a domestic‑law breach claim because the BIT did not contemplate the state suing the investor. |\n| **Ad‑hoc arbitration agreement** (separate agreement between the parties) | If the parties have signed a separate “consent to arbitrate” covering the counter‑claim, the tribunal will treat it as consent. | *Maffezini v. Spain* (ICSID ARB/97/7) – a separate settlement agreement was deemed to give Spain consent to arbitrate a claim by the investor, but the state’s own counter‑claim was still subject to the “connection” test. |\n| **No express or implied consent** | The tribunal will **dismiss** the counter‑claim for lack of jurisdiction. | *Waste Management, Inc. v. Mexico* (ICSID ARB/03/1) – Mexico’s counter‑claim was rejected because the BIT did not give Mexico consent to be sued for alleged violations of Mexican environmental statutes. |\n\n**Take‑away for the Brazil‑Poland BIT:**  \nThe BIT contains no specific counter‑claim clause, but its dispute‑settlement provision reads:\n\n> “Any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be submitted to arbitration…”.\n\nMost tribunals treat such language as **broad enough to cover a host‑state claim** *provided* the claim is linked to the same investment and the same contract.  The BIT therefore gives **implied consent** – but the counter‑claim must still pass the “connection” test.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  The “connection” (or “same transaction”) test\n\n### 2.1 What the test looks for\n\n1. **Same contract / investment** – The counter‑claim must arise out of the same concession, licence, or contract that is the subject of the investor’s claim.  \n2. **Same factual matrix** – The events giving rise to the state’s claim must be the same or substantially overlapping with those giving rise to the investor’s claim.  \n3. **Same legal basis** – The state’s claim must be grounded in the same treaty or contractual provision that the investor relies on (or in a provision that the treaty pulls in, such as an “umbrella clause”).  \n\nIf any of these elements is missing, tribunals have usually ruled the counter‑claim **inadmissible**.\n\n### 2.2 How tribunals have applied the test\n\n| **Case** | **Result** | **Reasoning on connection** |\n|----------|------------|-----------------------------|\n| *CMS Energy v. Argentina* (ICSID ARB/00/5) | **Admitted** | The state’s claim that Argentina breached the concession contract (by failing to grant a water‑use permit) was based on the same concession agreement that gave rise to the investor’s claim for damages. |\n| *Biwater v. Tanzania* (ICSID ARB/03/30) | **Rejected** | Tanzania’s claim that Biwater violated Tanzanian environmental statutes was not “connected” to the investor’s claim for breach of the concession because the environmental violations were alleged to have occurred *before* the concession was granted. |\n| *Vattenfall v. Germany* (ICSID ARB/12/30) | **Rejected** | Germany’s counter‑claim that Vattenfall breached German renewable‑energy law was deemed unrelated to the investor’s claim for breach of the BIT’s fair‑and‑equitable‑treatment clause. |\n| *Urbaser v. Argentina* (ICSID ARB/10/7) | **Rejected** | Argentina’s claim that Urbaser violated domestic environmental regulations was not sufficiently linked to the investor’s claim for breach of the BIT’s protection‑and‑security clause. |\n| *Saluka v. Czech Republic* (ICSID ARB/03/5) | **Rejected** | The Czech Republic’s claim that Saluka breached Czech environmental law was considered a separate domestic dispute, not “arising out of the investment”. |\n| *Waste Management v. Mexico* (ICSID ARB/03/1) | **Rejected** | Mexico’s counter‑claim was based on alleged violations of Mexican waste‑management statutes that were not the legal basis of the investor’s claim. |\n| *Maffezini v. Spain* (ICSID ARB/97/7) | **Admitted (on jurisdiction)** | Spain’s claim that the investor breached a settlement agreement was linked to the same investment contract that gave rise to the investor’s claim. |\n| *Chevron v. Ecuador* (ICSID ARB/10/8) | **Rejected** | Ecuador’s counter‑claim for alleged breach of Ecuadorian environmental law was not “connected” to the investor’s claim for breach of the BIT’s fair‑and‑equitable‑treatment clause. |\n| *Tethyan Copper v. Eritrea* (ICSID ARB/13/42) – (counter‑claim by Eritrea) | **Admitted** (later withdrawn) | Eritrea’s claim that the investor failed to comply with Eritrean mining‑law obligations was deemed to arise out of the same mining concession. |\n\n**Practical implication:**  \nYour client’s claim that the farm’s construction caused damage to protected habitats **is the factual basis of the state’s counter‑claim**. Because the same construction activity is also the factual basis of the investor’s claim for compensation (or for a breach of the BIT’s fair‑and‑equitable‑treatment / full‑protection‑and‑security obligations), the “connection” test is **likely to be satisfied** – *provided* the state frames its claim as a breach of a treaty‑based obligation (e.g., violation of the BIT’s “full protection and security” clause or an “umbrella clause” that incorporates domestic environmental law).\n\nIf the state instead frames the claim purely as a **domestic‑law enforcement action** (e.g., “the farm violated Brazil’s National Environmental Policy Act”), many tribunals have found that insufficiently connected and have dismissed the claim (see *Biwater*, *Vattenfall*, *Urbaser*).\n\n---\n\n## 3.  The applicable‑law component\n\n1. **Treaty‑based substantive basis** – If the BIT contains an **umbrella clause** (or a “full protection and security” clause) that incorporates the host‑state’s domestic law, the state can rely on that clause to bring a counter‑claim.  The clause must be interpreted to give the state a right to enforce the domestic law against the investor.  \n   *Example:* In *CMS Energy*, the tribunal held that the BIT’s “full protection and security” clause could be used by the state to enforce its own regulatory obligations.  \n\n2. **Domestic law as a “stand‑alone” basis** – When the BIT is silent on the domestic‑law issue, tribunals are split.  Some (e.g., *Saluka*, *Biwater*, *Vattenfall*) have required the state to anchor its claim in a treaty provision; others (e.g., *CMS Energy*, *Tethyan Copper*) have allowed a claim that the investor breached domestic law **because** that breach also constituted a breach of the BIT’s substantive obligations.  \n\n3. **UNCITRAL Rules** –  \n   * **Art. 21(2)** – The tribunal decides whether it has jurisdiction over any claim, including counter‑claims.  \n   * **Art. 22** – The tribunal may **amend** the arbitration agreement (or the scope of the arbitration) if the parties consent.  \n   * **Art. 23(1)** – The tribunal may **decide on any counter‑claim** that “arises out of the same transaction or occurrence” as the claim that gave rise to the arbitration.  \n\nThus, the **UNCITRAL Rules do not create a separate “counter‑claim” regime**; they simply give the tribunal discretion to accept or reject a claim based on the same jurisdictional analysis applied to the original claim.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Leading cases – quick reference\n\n| **Case** | **Jurisdiction** | **State’s Counter‑claim** | **Outcome** | **Key Reasoning** |\n|----------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| **CMS Energy v. Argentina** | ICSID (2002) | Breach of concession contract & domestic law (water‑use permits) | **Admitted** | Same concession contract; claim tied to BIT’s “full protection and security” clause. |\n| **Tethyan Copper v. Eritrea** | ICSID (2020) | Failure to comply with Eritrean mining law (environmental provisions) | **Admitted** (later withdrawn) | Same mining concession; domestic law incorporated via “full protection and security”. |\n| **Maffezini v. Spain** | ICSID (2000) | Violation of settlement agreement (domestic law) | **Admitted** (jurisdiction) | Same investment contract; treaty language broad enough. |\n| **Saluka v. Czech Republic** | ICSID (2006) | Violation of Czech environmental statutes | **Rejected** | Not “arising out of the investment”; domestic law claim separate. |\n| **Biwater v. Tanzania** | ICSID (2008) | Violation of Tanzanian environmental law | **Rejected** | No sufficient factual/legal connection. |\n| **Vattenfall v. Germany** | ICSID (2015) | Breach of German renewable‑energy law | **Rejected** | Claim not linked to the BIT‑based claim. |\n| **Urbaser v. Argentina** | ICSID (2014) | Breach of Argentine environmental regulations | **Rejected** | Lack of connection; domestic‑law claim viewed as separate. |\n| **Waste Management v. Mexico** | ICSID (2005) | Violations of Mexican waste‑management statutes | **Rejected** | No treaty‑based basis; claim seen as domestic enforcement. |\n| **Chevron v. Ecuador** | ICSID (2022) | Breach of Ecuadorian environmental law | **Rejected** | Not sufficiently connected; tribunal held that the BIT did not give Ecuador a right to enforce its own statutes. |\n| **Lanco v. Argentina** | UNCITRAL (2021) | Breach of Argentine environmental licensing | **Rejected** | Counter‑claim not “connected” to the investor’s claim for breach of the BIT. |\n\n*Note:* The above list is not exhaustive but captures the", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 192, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 4288}, "latency_s": 17.704735666979104, "request_id": "chatcmpl-ccede14f-84a4-4be3-b69a-bd2d253218b4", "raw_response": null}
