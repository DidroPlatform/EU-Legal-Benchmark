The response mentions reputation damages under the 'Substantive Defense and Counter-Strategy' section, stating: 'If arbitrable, limit to foreseeable contract harms (*Hadley v Baxendale* via Delaware); prove causation lacking.' While it addresses causation generally in the context of limiting damages, it does not explicitly state the requirement for *but-for* causation, which is the specific legal standard often required for proving damages (i.e., that the breach, not some other factor, caused the harm). The reference to *Hadley v Baxendale* relates to foreseeability, not the specific standard of proof for causation itself.\", \"criterion_id\": \"28978d72-d128-48d8-813a-427cc7e23507\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2060, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 2261}, "latency_s": 0.8659342079772614, "request_id": "FjKVaZLeJv7MkdUP7NXHmAk", "raw_response": null}
