Choice A is the standard ECHR admissibility declaration formula that declares a complaint admissible after finding it not manifestly ill-founded, which is the typical continuation when the Court moves to assess a substantive complaint under a new Article heading. Choices B and C reject the complaint as inadmissible, which would be inconsistent with introducing a new article heading for further examination. Choice D is also an admissibility declaration but includes language about Article 29 § 3 and examining merits below, which is more typical of a Chamber/Committee decision format rather than a simple admissibility assessment within a judgment. Choice A provides the most natural and concise continuation for declaring the Article 14/Article 8 complaint admissible before proceeding to its merits.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 479, "completion_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 691}, "latency_s": 5.961047584016342, "request_id": "chatcmpl-900ae74b-a07b-4154-a1f6-fef7e3a5ad6e", "raw_response": null}
