The priority question between your equitable interest and the bank's legal charge is complex and fact-dependent.\n\n## The Core Legal Issue: Priority of Interests\n\n**The general rule:**\n- A legal charge (mortgage) normally takes priority over an earlier equitable interest (like your constructive trust claim)\n- BUT this depends heavily on whether the lender is a *bona fide purchaser for value without notice*\n\n## Your Potential Arguments Against the Bank\n\n### 1. **Actual or Constructive Notice**\n\nThe bank may NOT have priority if they had notice of your interest when lending:\n\n**Did the bank know or should they have known?**\n- Were you living at the property when they conducted their valuation?\n- Did the valuer see evidence of your occupation or recent renovations?\n- Were there any documents suggesting joint ownership or your financial contribution?\n- Did your ex disclose the source of funds for the renovations in the mortgage application?\n\nIf the bank had *any* reason to investigate further and didn't, they may have constructive notice of your equitable interest.\n\n### 2. **Fraud/Undue Influence Arguments**\n\n**If your ex misrepresented the situation to the bank:**\n- Did they claim the renovation funds were their own?\n- Did they conceal that the property was subject to a dispute?\n- Did they fraudulently obtain the advance?\n\nUnder *Barclays Bank v O'Brien* [1994] and *CIBC Mortgages v Pitt* [1994], if fraud or misrepresentation is involved, the bank's charge may be set aside or postponed.\n\n### 3. **The Timing is Crucial**\n\n**Your constructive trust arose when you made your contributions** (during renovations). The bank's charge arose six months ago. \n\n**The question:** Did the bank have notice of your pre-existing equitable interest?\n\nIf you were in actual occupation, *Williams & Glyn's Bank v Boland* [1981] establishes that your occupation gives constructive notice to anyone dealing with the property.\n\n## What You Must Do Immediately\n\n### 1. **Register Your Interest**\n- File a **unilateral notice** or **restriction** at the Land Registry immediately\n- This protects your priority going forward and signals to all parties you're serious\n- Even if registered after the bank's charge, it preserves your claim and prevents further dealings\n\n### 2. **Investigate the Mortgage Application**\nRequest (through your solicitor):\n- The bank's valuation report from six months ago\n- The mortgage application your ex submitted\n- Any declarations your ex made about sole ownership\n- Evidence of what enquiries the bank made\n\n### 3. **Gather Evidence of Your Occupation/Interest**\n- Utility bills in your name at the property\n- Correspondence sent to you there\n- Photographs showing you living there during renovations\n- Witness statements from neighbors, contractors, etc.\n- Any documents showing your financial contributions\n\n### 4. **Consider a Proprietary Estoppel Claim**\nGiven your ex's assurances and your reliance, this may be stronger than constructive trust and could give you priority.\n\n## The Bank's Vulnerability\n\n**The bank is NOT invincible here:**\n\n1. **They have a duty to investigate** - If there were obvious signs of your interest (occupation, recent major renovations to a property owned by someone who just divorced), they should have made enquiries\n\n2. **Mortgage fraud concerns** - If your ex misrepresented the situation, the bank may have a claim against your ex, not you\n\n3. **Banks settle** - Facing litigation over whether they had constructive notice is expensive and uncertain for them too\n\n## Negotiation Leverage\n\n**Don't accept your ex's offer yet.** You have leverage:\n\n1. **The slander of title claim** - Your ex faces costs and potential damages if they lose\n\n2. **The bank's exposure** - If the bank's charge is postponed to your interest, they lose priority on €200k\n\n3. **Fraud investigation** - If your ex committed mortgage fraud, that's a criminal matter\n\n4. **Delay** - Litigation will freeze this property for years, costing everyone\n\n## Realistic Assessment\n\n**Your solicitor should be evaluating:**\n\n- **Strong case if:** You were in occupation, the bank's valuer saw evidence of this, and your ex misrepresented the situation\n\n- **Moderate case if:** You can prove your contributions and the bank should have made further enquiries\n\n- **Weak case if:** You had moved out, there was no evidence of your interest visible to the bank, and your ex appeared to be sole owner\n\n## Immediate Action Plan\n\n1. **Do NOT agree to walk away** - this is a negotiating tactic\n2. **Instruct your solicitor to**:\n   - Register your interest immediately\n   - Request disclosure from the bank\n   - Investigate the mortgage application\n   - Prepare a detailed case on notice/occupation\n3. **Consider reporting potential mortgage fraud** to the bank's fraud department\n4. **Explore mediation** - with both your ex and potentially the bank\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n**Your ex's solicitor is trying to scare you into surrendering.** While the bank's involvement complicates matters significantly, it does NOT automatically defeat your claim.\n\nThe priority question turns on whether the bank had notice of your interest - and if you were living there and the property had just undergone major renovations, there's a strong argument they did or should have.\n\n**This requires specialist litigation advice immediately** - ideally from a barrister experienced in property priority disputes. The initial consultation cost will be worth it to understand your true position.\n\nDon't let them bully you into walking away from €180k without a proper fight.\n\n---\n**What evidence do you have of living at the property when the remortgage happened? That's likely the key to everything.**", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 220, "completion_tokens": 1363, "total_tokens": 1583}, "latency_s": 28.571659208013443, "request_id": "chatcmpl-b5149df7-b6c6-40de-b345-dde6250f615d", "raw_response": null}
