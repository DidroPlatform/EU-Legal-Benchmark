The candidate answer discusses the liability of Synthetic Dreams (the AI company) and the advertiser (the user of the AI output in the ad) for direct infringement (display/adaptation) and moral rights breach. However, it does not explicitly discuss the secondary infringement liability of the fizzy drink company (if they are considered separate from the user who generated the image) or the user who generated the image, specifically referencing the 'knew or had reason to believe' standard required for secondary infringement under UK law (CDPA s. 27 for secondary infringement of copyright, or the general principle for authorising infringement). The analysis focuses on direct infringement by the user/advertiser (public display/adaptation) and the AI company (copying/adaptation), not the specific secondary infringement standard for the downstream commercial user.\", \"criterion_id\": \"02af10b1-fa24-413b-83c6-99edfcdf7c8c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4258, "completion_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 4509}, "latency_s": 1.212558208964765, "request_id": "GO2UafnhJfnOnsEPkprNkQM", "raw_response": null}
