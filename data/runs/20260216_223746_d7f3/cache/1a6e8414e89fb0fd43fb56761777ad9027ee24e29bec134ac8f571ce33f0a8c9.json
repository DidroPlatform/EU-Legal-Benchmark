The candidate answer mentions Section 163(j) and earnings stripping rules as limitations on interest deductibility but does not explicitly mention or refer to the 'thin capitalization doctrine' (which is often associated with domestic or treaty-based limitations on debt-to-equity ratios, distinct from the U.S. Section 163(j) limitation which focuses on a percentage of adjusted taxable income). Since the specific term or concept of the 'thin capitalization doctrine' is absent, the criterion is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8fdccc9f-9087-40ec-b39f-52d653aca87b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1009, "completion_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 1191}, "latency_s": 0.9035187079571187, "request_id": "bxKVacT2OvjwxN8Px9POiQw", "raw_response": null}
