The response discusses the necessity of assets within the jurisdiction ('assets within (or passing through) the jurisdiction') for a standard freezing injunction and mentions the court's ability to extend relief to related entities in England under the *Chabra* jurisdiction. However, the core focus of the answer is on the court's *supportive* jurisdiction under Section 44 of the Arbitration Act 1996, which is generally exercised when assets are located in England, regardless of the arbitration seat. The response does not explicitly state that the *entire* jurisdiction of the English Courts for granting the injunction is limited *only* to assets connected to England, but rather that the presence of assets in England is a necessary condition for the *Mareva* requirements to be met, which is standard for English freezing orders. It does not make the specific assertion required by the criterion as a limitation on the court's power, but rather as a prerequisite for the relief sought.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1ecca6f8-3c08-4562-8fa2-0491fea32bb3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2246, "completion_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 2510}, "latency_s": 1.1247692499891855, "request_id": "f72UabfnHOLUkdUPgcXX-A4", "raw_response": null}
