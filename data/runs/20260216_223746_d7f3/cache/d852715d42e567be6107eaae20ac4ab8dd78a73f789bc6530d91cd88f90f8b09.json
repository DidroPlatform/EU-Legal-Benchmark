However, it does not explicitly state that the NL-SG treaty benefit *will hold up* if the *Dutch CV* passes the PPT. The analysis focuses more on the PPT applying to deny benefits generally, or the existence of a PE overriding the treaty, rather than confirming the specific condition required by the criterion regarding the NL-SG treaty benefit contingent on the CV passing PPT.\", \"criterion_id\": \"012f8564-ac72-4ce7-8e0e-0ebe7161dd9a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1186, "completion_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 1380}, "latency_s": 0.7740106249984819, "request_id": "itaUaYnlLLWVnsEPl_iniQI", "raw_response": null}
