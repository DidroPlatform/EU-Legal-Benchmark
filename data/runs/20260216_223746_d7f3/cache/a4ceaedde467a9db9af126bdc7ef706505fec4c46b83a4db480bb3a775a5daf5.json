Don't sign anything yet.\n\n## The Fatal Flaw in This \"Deal\"\n\nThat HMRC investigator just made a **catastrophic tactical error** by approaching you informally before charges are filed. This tells me three things:\n\n1. **Their case against your client is weaker than they're pretending** - if they had you cold, they wouldn't be negotiating\n2. **They're under pressure to flip someone quickly** to build the carousel fraud case\n3. **They just showed you their entire hand** - they NEED your client's cooperation more than your client needs this deal\n\n## Why This Deal Is Poison\n\nYou've correctly identified that any admission of \"should have known\" is:\n- Admissible in civil court\n- Devastating to your negligence defense  \n- Potentially disqualifying for your insurance coverage (willful blindness clauses)\n- Career-ending for your executives (medical board sanctions)\n\n**You'd be trading a tax problem for an existential civil liability problem.**\n\n## The Third Way: Restructure the Cooperation\n\nGo back with this counter-framework:\n\n### **\"Cooperation Without Confession\"**\n\n**What you WILL provide:**\n- All transactional records (these are discoverable anyway)\n- Timeline of the business relationship\n- Testimony about what you were *actually told* by the logistics company\n- Evidence of the logistics company's deception\n\n**What you will NOT provide:**\n- Any admission that red flags were \"ignored\"\n- Any statement about \"should have known\"\n- Any characterization of your client's mental state or due diligence\n\n### **The Narrative Pivot**\n\nYour position should be: *\"Our client was a victim of sophisticated fraud, not a willing participant. We will help you prosecute the criminals who deceived us, but we will not falsely confess to negligence we did not commit.\"*\n\n## The Leverage You Actually Have\n\n**HMRC's pressure points:**\n\n1. **Carousel fraud cases are notoriously hard to prosecute** - they need cooperating witnesses badly\n2. **Your client is a hospital** - the optics of bankrupting a healthcare provider over being defrauded are terrible\n3. **You have evidence of being defrauded** - the forensic accounting shows the logistics company's deception\n4. **Parliamentary scrutiny** - if this becomes public, \"HMRC bankrupts hospital that was fraud victim\" is a bad headline\n\n## The Negotiation Strategy\n\n**Phase 1: Reframe (This Week)**\n- Retain a specialized tax litigation QC immediately (not just your corporate team)\n- Have them approach HMRC formally: \"Our client is a victim willing to assist, not a co-conspirator\"\n- Request a formal meeting with senior HMRC leadership (not just the investigator)\n\n**Phase 2: Document Your Innocence (Parallel Track)**\n- Have forensics build a timeline showing when your client *could* have known vs. when they *actually* discovered the fraud\n- Document all the logistics company's deceptive practices\n- Show your normal due diligence procedures (you did vet them initially, right?)\n\n**Phase 3: Structured Cooperation Agreement**\nNegotiate for:\n- **Victim status**, not cooperating co-conspirator status\n- Financial liability limited to actual unpaid duties only (no penalties)\n- Payment plan over 7-10 years (manageable)\n- **Critically**: All cooperation statements are limited to \"factual observations\" with explicit language that nothing constitutes an admission of negligence or willful blindness\n\n**Phase 4: The Insurance Play**\n- Before signing ANYTHING, have your insurance coverage counsel review\n- Some policies have \"cooperation with authorities\" provisions that could actually help\n- Others have \"admission\" clauses that would void coverage - you need to know which you have\n\n## The Civil Case Firewall\n\n**Even if you cooperate, you can still argue in civil court:**\n\n\"Yes, we were defrauded by a criminal enterprise. Yes, we paid restitution for the tax consequences. No, this does not mean we were negligent in patient care. The contamination was undetectable without testing that exceeded industry standards.\"\n\n**The causation break:** The tax fraud and the contamination are separate issues. The logistics company didn't under-declare values *because* the devices were contaminated - they under-declared everything for everyone. \n\n## What To Do Monday Morning\n\n**Immediate actions:**\n\n1. **Do NOT respond to HMRC yet** - that \"informal approach\" was fishing\n2. **Retain a tax litigation QC** with carousel fraud experience (I can suggest names if you tell me your jurisdiction)\n3. **Emergency insurance coverage review** - before any admissions\n4. **Forensic timeline** - document exactly when you could have known what\n5. **Board meeting** - they need to understand this decision's implications\n\n**The question to ask your tax QC:**\n\"Can we cooperate as a victim-witness rather than a reformed co-conspirator, and what language protects us in civil litigation?\"\n\n## The Brutal Truth\n\nIf HMRC insists on the \"should have known\" language as non-negotiable, then **you fight the tax case**. Here's why:\n\n- Tax liability + penalties might be £10-20M\n- Civil judgments with a signed negligence confession could be £100M+\n- You can potentially negotiate tax debt down or restructure it\n- You cannot negotiate away a wrongful death judgment based on your own confession\n\n**Better to face uncertain tax litigation than certain civil annihilation.**\n\n## The Real Third Way\n\n**What if the hospital can't survive either scenario?**\n\nThen you need to be thinking about **pre-packaged administration** (UK) or **structured bankruptcy** (US):\n- Separate the clinical operations (keep running)\n- Ring-fence the liabilities (tax + civil) into a separate entity\n- Negotiate with creditors from a position of \"this is what's available\"\n- Preserve the actual healthcare mission\n\nBut that's a last resort, and you're not there yet.\n\n---\n\n**My gut answer to your question:** \n\n**Don't take the deal as offered. Restructure it or walk away.** \n\nThe investigator's informal approach means you have more leverage than you think. Use it.\n\nWhat's the timeline pressure here?
