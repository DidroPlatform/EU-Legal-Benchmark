However, it clearly describes the mechanism that replaces the full checks: goods staying in NI use the 'Green lane' with minimal checks, which is the operationalization of the 'not for EU' concept. Specifically, it states: \\\"Green lane: Goods staying in NI, moving between NI and GB, or moving GB\\u2192NI with no EU-destined purpose. These face minimal checks.\\\" This covers the core intent of the three required elements by detailing the green lane system which relies on trader declarations (the mechanism for 'trusted traders' and 'not for EU' goods).\", \"criterion_id\": \"ccda598d-81f1-4df2-bf89-43523370149a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1734, "completion_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 2020}, "latency_s": 1.1521773749846034, "request_id": "1-KUabP9GN_evdIPi9bMuAs", "raw_response": null}
