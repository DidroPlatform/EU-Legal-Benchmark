The candidate answer discusses the conflict between broad U.S. discovery (FRCP 26) and strict EU privacy laws (GDPR/BDSG) in the context of UK/Germany, specifically mentioning that German courts may block U.S.-style discovery under GDPR. However, it does not explicitly frame the *enforceability of U.S. discovery orders* as the *key uncertainty* in coordination, nor does it focus specifically on the EU's general stance on enforcing U.S. discovery orders (which is often blocked by sovereignty/privacy concerns, a central theme in cross-border litigation uncertainty). The answer focuses more on the *existence* of different discovery regimes and the use of 28 U.S.C. § 1782, rather than highlighting the *uncertainty of enforcement* as the primary coordination hurdle.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3e986a45-fd40-4d19-9122-1432a8a5e47d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4429, "completion_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 4686}, "latency_s": 0.9893916249857284, "request_id": "6_eUacL1Ib-fkdUPtcm3yAQ", "raw_response": null}
