The candidate answer mentions sensitive data (health-related data) in Section 4 and notes that stricter rules apply if such data is processed, but it does not explicitly state that Art. 9 (prohibiting processing of special categories/health data) is applicable to the situation described (which only asked about sports ability, not medical conditions). The answer focuses more on general transparency (Art. 12-14) and legal bases like consent/legitimate interest (Art. 6). Since the core question is about informing members, and the candidate answer correctly addresses the general transparency requirements, but fails to explicitly invoke Art. 9 as required by the specific criterion, it does not meet this strict requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a6fc30a4-31ce-4ed1-b43f-56851a1cdff2\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1013, "completion_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 1241}, "latency_s": 1.0852879590238445, "request_id": "VvWUabbgK_ujkdUP0fjD0QU", "raw_response": null}
