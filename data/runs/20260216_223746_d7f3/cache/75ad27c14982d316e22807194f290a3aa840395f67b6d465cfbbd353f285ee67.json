This assessment is based solely on the provisions of the Convention on Conduct of Fishing Operations in the North Atlantic (London, 1 June 1967), to which both Belgium and Spain are Contracting Parties.\n\n### Summary of Incident and Belgian Position\nBelgian authorised officers observed unmarked anchored lines in Convention waters (per Annex I), presumptively linked to a Spanish vessel. They approached the vessel to request information. The Spanish crew refused to cooperate. Belgium reported this to a review board, alleging (i) a violation due to unmarked gear and (ii) a further violation of Spain's Convention obligations due to the refusal.\n\n### Key Convention Provisions\n1. **Marking Requirement (Primary Alleged Violation)**:  \n   Article 5 mandates that \"nets, lines and other gear anchored in the sea... shall be marked... in accordance with the provisions of Annex IV.\" Annex IV, Rule 1 requires anchored gear to be fitted with buoys, flags/radar reflectors by day, and lights by night to indicate position and extent. Unmarked anchored lines clearly breach this obligation. Article 8(1) requires Spain, as flag State, to enforce compliance by its vessels.\n\n2. **Powers of Authorised Officers**:  \n   Article 9 applies outside national fishery limits. Belgian officers are \"authorised officers\" (Art. 9(2)-(3)). Under Art. 9(4)-(5), they may \"enquire and report on infringements,\" \"identify the vessel, seek to obtain the necessary information from the vessel and report.\" For serious matters, they may order the vessel to stop or board to verify facts (Art. 9(5)-(6)), but not while fishing except in emergencies (Art. 9(7)). No such order or boarding occurred here—only a request for information upon approach.\n\n3. **Cooperation and Resistance**:  \n   Article 9(10) deems \"[r]esistance by a vessel to the *directions* of an authorised officer\" as resistance to its flag State's authority. \"Directions\" refer to formal orders (e.g., to stop or board under Art. 9(5)-(6)). A mere request for information is an enquiry under Art. 9(5), not a binding direction. No Convention provision explicitly requires vessels to affirmatively provide information or cooperate with non-coercive requests. Annex VI(7) allows reporting after communicating intent, which occurred via the approach.\n\n4. **Review Board Jurisdiction**:  \n   Article 7(1) provides for review boards only \"[i]n any dispute that arises between the *nationals of different Contracting Parties concerning damaged gear or damage to vessels resulting from entanglement of gear*.\" Boards \"examine the facts and endeavour to bring about a settlement\" (Art. 7(1)); claims may also proceed via ordinary legal process (Art. 7(2)). No damage, entanglement, or dispute between nationals is alleged here—only an observed infringement and non-cooperation during an enquiry.\n\n5. **Spain's Reservation**:  \n   Spain reserved on Art. 9(5)-(6) per Art. 14(3), binding itself only vis-à-vis Contracting Parties that did *not* reserve against Spain. Belgium made no such reservation (cf. listed reservations for France, FRG, Portugal, Spain, USSR). Thus, Art. 9(5)-(6) binds Spain vis-à-vis Belgium, but this does not alter the lack of mandatory cooperation for requests short of directions.\n\n6. **Reporting and Enforcement**:  \n   Belgium may report suspected infringements (Art. 9(5); Annex VI(7)). Spain must \"consider and act on reports of foreign authorised officers... on the same basis as reports of national officers\" (Art. 9(11)), potentially facilitating proceedings. However, enforcement remains Spain's responsibility (Art. 8(1)).\n\n### Likely Review Board Decision\nThe review board will **likely dismiss Belgium's claim that the refusal constitutes a *further* violation of Spain's Convention obligations**, for two independent reasons:\n\n1. **Lack of Jurisdiction**: Art. 7 review boards are strictly limited to damage/entanglement disputes between nationals. No such elements exist. Invoking Art. 7 for a general infringement report or non-coercive enquiry exceeds its scope. The board will probably decline to examine the matter or rule it inadmissible.\n\n2. **No Substantive Further Violation**: Even if jurisdiction were assumed, refusal to provide information does not breach the Convention. Authorised officers may *seek* information (Art. 9(5)), but vessels have no explicit duty to supply it absent a formal direction/order (e.g., to stop/board), which triggers Art. 9(10) resistance. The marking violation stands alone, actionable by Spain under Arts. 8-9(11)—not as a \"further\" breach via the crew's response.\n\nSpain should internally investigate the marking issue per Art. 8(1) and Art. 9(11), documenting action on Belgium's report to demonstrate compliance. No penalties or findings against Spain are anticipated from the board.\n\nPlease contact me if further analysis or representation is needed.\n\n**Best regards,**  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position, e.g., Legal Advisor, International Fisheries Law]  \n[Contact Information]  \n**Attachment: Excerpts from Convention (Arts. 5, 7, 9; Annexes IV, VI)**", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 11609, "completion_tokens": 4636, "total_tokens": 16245}, "latency_s": 48.71669191701221, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJCVWB4Q5W11J114TK7E8Y", "raw_response": null}
