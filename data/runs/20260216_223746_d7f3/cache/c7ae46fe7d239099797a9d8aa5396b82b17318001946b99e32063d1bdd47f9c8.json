The candidate answer addresses the 'at risk' test by stating that goods are presumed at risk unless proven otherwise, and that this applies to goods going to the EU or those whose destination cannot be verified. Crucially, under the section 'For goods from third countries (your China example)', it states: 'Coming directly to NI from China \\u2192 presumed at risk \\u2192 Red Lane \\u2192 full EU customs procedures apply UNLESS the importer is in the Trusted Trader scheme AND can demonstrate goods are for NI final consumption only'. While it doesn't use the exact phrasing 'processed in NI to become parts of products', the core concept of goods being 'at risk' of entering the EU market (which covers subsequent processing and onward movement) is clearly explained through the Green/Red lane system and the presumption of risk, which is the mechanism governing this inclusion. The explanation of the default position and the need to prove goods are NOT at risk covers the scope of what constitutes 'at risk' under the Protocol/Framework.\", \"criterion_id\": \"fc71b680-fd6e-4d06-9a32-d540462c9927\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1979, "completion_tokens": 305, "total_tokens": 2284}, "latency_s": 1.2232485830027144, "request_id": "edOUaaCVJtrOnsEPw-rG0AM", "raw_response": null}
