The response mentions the need for a 'smoking gun' like 'emails proving the company knew the allegations were false, or a whistleblower willing to testify' as a condition for pursuing litigation (Option 2). This suggests that such evidence is *helpful* or *necessary* to win the case, not that the existence of whistleblower evidence *itself* affirmatively proves defamation. The response correctly frames the difficulty of proving malice in UK defamation law, which contradicts the idea that whistleblower evidence alone proves the case.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3ed2d9f3-a8db-466a-bb92-18a68358c408\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2546, "completion_tokens": 169, "total_tokens": 2715}, "latency_s": 0.7471297080046497, "request_id": "xvmUadnuCtuxnsEPg_7zyAU", "raw_response": null}
