Furthermore, under the 'Enforcement Toolkit' table, it lists 'Random Audits & Data Verification' and 'Technology-Enabled Monitoring' (which implies algorithmic auditing). The recommendation section also suggests leveraging technology for data linkage, which is a form of automated auditing/verification. This clearly satisfies the requirement to propose mandatory enforcement mechanisms like auditing or mandatory disclosure.\", \"criterion_id\": \"71239f09-3c08-4b68-ad2a-00016917f4aa\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4475, "completion_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 4683}, "latency_s": 1.1215595840476453, "request_id": "c_GUafuzJI-VkdUPpZbhqAk", "raw_response": null}
