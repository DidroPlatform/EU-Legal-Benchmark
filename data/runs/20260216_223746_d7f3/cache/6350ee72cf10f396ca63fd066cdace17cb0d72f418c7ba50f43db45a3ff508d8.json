The response discusses \\u00a7245A in the context of dividends repatriated from the CFC to the U.S. parent, noting that it makes equity financing attractive by exempting repatriated dividends. It discusses GILTI separately under Section 951A. While the response correctly implies that GILTI is a current inclusion regime that is distinct from the \\u00a7245A deduction (which applies to dividends), it never explicitly states the required negative proposition: that the \\u00a7245A exemption does not apply to GILTI inclusions. The structure of the answer suggests an understanding of the distinction, but it fails to articulate the specific required statement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"58f49d20-37dc-4fe5-a083-0c6b5c841774\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4351, "completion_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 4577}, "latency_s": 1.0033663339854684, "request_id": "ScWUaedxht7szw_zmISQBQ", "raw_response": null}
