The candidate answer explicitly states that goods arriving directly from third countries (like China) are subject to **EU-rate tariffs and full customs controls** at the point of entry, as they are not covered by the Green Lane and are treated as entering the EU market. This directly supports the premise of the criterion (subject to EU tariff rate and effectively 'red lane' treatment). However, the criterion specifies 'if they are flowing to the EU'. The candidate states they are subject to EU tariffs upon entry to NI, regardless of onward destination (though reimbursement is possible if staying in the UK). Since the candidate confirms EU tariff application for direct third-country imports, which is the most stringent control, it satisfies the core requirement regarding tariff application for third-country goods entering NI.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f57b3384-02c0-47f0-b614-11a03bd257cb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4159, "completion_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 4401}, "latency_s": 0.9733065830077976, "request_id": "OsWUacEWiaKewQ_ztLqQBQ", "raw_response": null}
