The candidate answer discusses priority concerning a *lender's charge* (mortgagee) and the user's *equitable interest* (constructive trust), focusing heavily on actual occupation, notice, and the nature of the further advance (optional vs. obligatory). While overreaching is a concept related to how a purchaser/lender takes free of equitable interests, the response does not explicitly state the condition that a purchaser is only bound if the interest was *not overreached*. The discussion centers on whether the *lender's charge* takes priority over the equitable interest, which is a related but distinct concept from whether the interest itself was overreached by the transaction that created the charge.\", \"criterion_id\": \"df80a01f-5c25-46b6-9fa5-097a4aa3f543\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2472, "completion_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 2693}, "latency_s": 1.278326790954452, "request_id": "9BiVaZGrKtqb28oPgOmZoQg", "raw_response": null}
