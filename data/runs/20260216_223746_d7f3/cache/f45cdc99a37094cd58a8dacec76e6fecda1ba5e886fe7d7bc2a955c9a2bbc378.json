INTRODUCTION**\n\nYou act for [Client] charged under s.20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 (\"unlawful wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm\") following a street altercation. The Crown alleges your client wounded the complainant using a piece of broken glass. Your instructions indicate the client contends he acted in self-defence, having been attacked first, and held a genuine (though mistaken) belief that the complainant was armed and posed a lethal threat.\n\nThis brief analyses the statutory and common law framework for self-defence, the treatment of honest but mistaken beliefs, and provides a preliminary assessment of prospects.\n\n---\n\n**2. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK**\n\nSelf-defence is governed by **s.76 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008** (CJIA 2008), which codifies the existing common law while preserving established principles.\n\n**The Two-Stage Test (s.76(3)-(7) CJIA 2008):**\n\nThe defence requires the jury to consider two distinct questions:\n\n**Stage One: Subjective Belief (The \"Necessity\" of Force)**\n- Did the defendant *genuinely believe* that circumstances existed which justified the use of force?\n- This is assessed **subjectively** from the defendant's perspective (**R v Gladstone Williams** [1984] 78 Cr App R 276; **R v Owino** [1996] 2 Cr App R 128).\n- Under **s.76(3)**, the defendant is entitled to use such force as he *genuinely believed* was necessary, even if that belief was mistaken.\n\n**Stage Two: Objective Reasonableness (The \"Proportionality\" of Force)**\n- Was the *degree* of force used *reasonable* in the circumstances **as the defendant believed them to be**? (**s.76(3)-(4)**).\n- This is assessed **objectively**, but through the lens of the defendant's mistaken belief (**R v Williams (Gladstone)** [1987] 3 All ER 411).\n- **s.76(6)**: In assessing reasonableness, the court must consider the circumstances known to the defendant (including his mistaken beliefs).\n- **s.76(5)**: Force which is \"disproportionate\" (as opposed to merely unreasonable) cannot be justified.\n\n---\n\n**3. MISTAKEN BELIEF: KEY PRINCIPLES**\n\nYour client's case hinges on an **honest but mistaken belief** regarding the complainant's armed status. The following authorities establish that such a mistake does not defeat the defence, provided it was genuinely held:\n\n**A. The \"Circumstances as Believed\" Principle**\nIn **R v Williams (Gladstone)** [1987] 3 All ER 411, the Court of Appeal held that a defendant is to be judged on the facts as he *honestly believed* them to be, even if that belief was erroneous. Lord Lane CJ stated:\n> \"The reasonableness of the defendant's belief is material only to the question whether the defendant held the belief genuinely... once the defendant honestly believes he is in immediate danger, the question of proportionality is to be judged on the basis of the facts as he believed them to be.\"\n\n**B. The Subjective Nature of the Belief**\n**R v Beckford v R** [1988] AC 130 (PC) confirmed that if the defendant honestly believed he was in danger of death or serious injury, he could use such force as was reasonably necessary to meet *that* perceived threat, even if no such danger in fact existed.\n\n**C. Limits on Mistake**\nThe belief must be **genuinely held** (**s.76(4) CJIA 2008**). However:\n- If the mistaken belief was **held under intoxication**, it provides no defence (**R v O'Grady** [1987] QB 995).\n- If the mistake was **so unreasonable** that the jury concludes it could not have been genuinely held, the defence fails (**R v Keane** [2010] EWCA Crim 2514).\n- The mistake must relate to **facts**, not law (**R v S** [2016] EWCA Crim 1617).\n\n**D. Degree of Force in Mistaken Circumstances**\nWhere the defendant mistakenly believes the attacker is armed, he may be justified in using a weapon or greater force than would have been necessary against an unarmed man (**R v Palmer** [1971] AC 814 applied in **R v Cousins** (1982) 74 Cr App R 363).\n\n---\n\n**4. SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR THIS CASE**\n\n**A. The Level of Force (Broken Glass/GBH)**\nYour client used a potentially lethal weapon (broken glass) causing wounding/GBH. This presents the greatest evidential hurdle:\n- **Proportionality**: Even accepting the client believed the complainant was armed, the force used must not be \"disproportionate\" (**s.76(5)**).\n- **R v Clegg** [1995] 1 AC 482 establishes that where the threat has passed or the force used is clearly excessive (e.g., lethal force against minor threat), the defence fails.\n- However, **R v Osbourne and Virtue** [1973] QB 678 suggests that if the defendant *honestly believed* his life was in danger, the use of a weapon may be proportionate.\n\n**B. The Initial Aggressor**\nSelf-defence is not available to the initial aggressor (**R v Rashford** [2005] EWCA Crim 3377), unless:\n- The initial aggression was de minimis; or\n- The victim's response was so disproportionate that the roles effectively reversed (**R v Field** [1972] Crim LR 435).\n\nYour instructions suggest the complainant \"first attacked\" your client. This must be supported by evidence (CCTV, witnesses) to establish your client was not the initial aggressor.\n\n**C. Retreat and Imminence**\nWhile **s.76(3)** expressly states a person acting in self-defence is *not* under a duty to retreat, **s.76(4)** permits the fact-finder to consider whether the defendant could have retreated as evidence going to the reasonableness of the belief that force was necessary (**R v Bird** [1985] 1 WLR 816).\n- The threat must be **imminent** (though not necessarily instantaneous) (**R v Keane** [2010]).\n- If your client could have safely retreated but chose to arm himself with glass and re-engage, this undermines the defence.\n\n**D. The \"Armed\" Complainant**\nSince the complainant was in fact unarmed, the jury must assess:\n1. Was the client's belief that the complainant was armed **genuinely held**?\n2. If yes, was the use of broken glass **proportionate** to the threat of an armed attacker?\n3. If the belief was unreasonable (e.g., no basis in the complainant's behaviour), the jury may reject it as not genuinely held (**R v Shaw** (2002) The Times, 28 March).\n\n---\n\n**5. EVIDENTIAL BURDEN**\n\n- The Crown must disprove self-defence **beyond reasonable doubt** once an evidential foundation is laid (**R v Lobell** [1957] 1 QB 547).\n- The defendant need only raise evidence \"capable of supporting\" the defence (**R v Cousins**).\n- The burden then shifts to the Crown to negative either the honest belief in the need for force, or the reasonableness of the degree of force used.\n\n---\n\n**6. ASSESSMENT OF PROSPECTS**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- If independent evidence supports the complainant attacked first, your client establishes he was not the aggressor.\n- The use of a weapon (glass) may be justifiable if the jury accepts the honest belief the complainant was armed and posed a lethal threat (**R v Williams**).\n- The subjective nature of the belief test works in your client's favour if his account is credible.\n\n**Weaknesses/Risks:**\n- **Proportionality**: Causing GBH with broken glass is a high level of force. Even if the complainant was armed, the jury may consider glass to the face/body disproportionate unless the threat was truly lethal and immediate.\n- **Credibility of Mistake**: Without objective corroboration (e.g., victim reaching for waistband, dark object in hand), the jury may find the belief in an armed attacker was not genuinely held, or was a paranoid overreaction.\n- **Availability of Retreat**: If the client had opportunity to withdraw or de-escalate but chose to grab glass, this suggests retaliation rather than necessary defence (**R v Rashford**).\n\n**Overall Prospects:**\n- **50-60%** if credible independent evidence supports the initial attack and your client's consistent account of fearing a weapon.\n- Significantly reduced if the client continued striking after the threat subsided, or if CCTV shows the complainant's hands were visible and empty.\n\n---\n\n**7. RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1. **Immediate Evidence**: Secure CCTV from the location; identify witnesses who saw the commencement of the altercation; obtain medical evidence of any injuries to your client consistent with being attacked first.\n\n2. **Instructions Detail**: Clarify:\n   - Precisely what made the client believe the complainant was armed (movement, object in hand, verbal threats?)\n   - Whether the client could have retreated or sought help\n   - Whether the force continued after the complainant was incapacitated or fled\n\n3. **Expert Evidence**: Consider whether a psychologist's report is warranted if the client has psychiatric history explaining heightened threat perception (though this risks undermining the \"genuine\" belief if it suggests irrationality).\n\n4. **Alternative Defences**: Keep open the possibility of **provocation** (now loss of control under Coroners and Justice Act 2009) as a fallback, though this requires loss of self-control and carries mandatory sentencing implications.\n\n**Conclusion**\nSelf-defence is arguable but finely balanced on the facts. The broken glass creates a high threshold, but if the jury accepts the honest belief in an armed, life-threatening assault, the defence is sustainable. The focus must be on establishing the genuineness of the mistaken belief and the absence of safe retreat.\n\n*Prepared by: [Your name]*\n*Date: [Date]*", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 155, "completion_tokens": 3509, "total_tokens": 3664}, "latency_s": 127.5950995000021, "request_id": "chatcmpl-8ed800b9a7ed161d", "raw_response": null}
