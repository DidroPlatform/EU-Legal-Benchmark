Housing laws in the UK are complex, and you should speak with a qualified solicitor or contact a housing charity like **Shelter** immediately.\n\nBased on the details you provided, here is an analysis of your legal position.\n\n### 1. The \"No Rent\" Factor: You Likely Do Not Have an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST)\nThe most critical factor in your situation is that you have not been paying rent.\n\nIn England, most private renters have an **Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST)**, which provides strong protections against eviction (specifically requiring a Section 21 notice and a court order). However, under the Housing Act 1988, a tenancy cannot be an AST if the tenant does not pay rent (or if the rent is extremely low, below £250 a year in London).\n\nBecause you have not been paying rent, you likely fall into one of two categories:\n*   **A Licensee:** If your living arrangement was informal (e.g., you were a friend or caretaker staying with permission), you may have a \"license.\" This offers fewer protections than a tenancy.\n*   **A Common Law Tenant:** If you had exclusive possession of the room (a lock on your door) and a tenancy agreement (even if rent wasn't paid), you may be a \"common law\" or \"contractual\" tenant.\n\n**Why this matters:** You do **not** have the full statutory protection of a standard rent-paying tenant. This means the new owner cannot simply change the locks (that is illegal), but the process to remove you may be faster than a standard eviction.\n\n### 2. The New Owner and \"Succession of Tenancy\"\nWhen a property is sold, the buyer generally purchases it \"subject to\" the existing rights of the people living there.\n\nEven if you do not have an AST, if you have a **common law tenancy**, the new owner steps into the shoes of the old landlord. They must respect your right to occupy the property until your tenancy is legally ended. They cannot simply tell you to leave verbally; they must serve the correct legal notice.\n\n### 3. The Issue of Abandonment\nYou mentioned that you have been away for 6 months and ignored the buyer’s text message. This is problematic.\n\nThe new owner might argue that you have **abandoned** or **surrendered** the tenancy. However, because you left your belongings there, you have a strong argument that you did not intend to give up the room. Ignoring the text was unwise, but it does not automatically legally terminate your right to live there.\n\nIf you are a tenant (even a common law one), the landlord cannot treat the property as abandoned without going through the legal process to regain possession.\n\n### 4. Protection from Illegal Eviction\nRegardless of whether you are a licensee or a tenant, you are protected under the **Protection from Eviction Act 1977**.\n\nIt is a **criminal offense** for the new owner to:\n*   Change the locks while you are out.\n*   Use force or threats to make you leave.\n*   Cut off utilities (water, gas, electricity) to force you out.\n\nIf the new owner attempts any of these, you should call the police and contact the local council’s housing department immediately.\n\n### 5. What the New Owner Must Do\nSince you do not have an AST, the new owner cannot use a Section 21 notice. Instead, to remove you legally, they must likely:\n\n1.  **Serve a Notice to Quit:** For a common law tenancy, they must serve a formal notice to end your tenancy. The notice period is usually at least 4 weeks, but this can vary.\n2.  **Go to Court:** If you do not leave after the notice expires, they must apply to the court for a **Possession Order**.\n3.  **Enforcement:** Only court bailiffs can physically remove you.\n\n### Summary\n*   **Do you have protection?** Yes. You cannot be forcibly removed without a court order. The fact that you have lived there for 10 years and kept your belongings there strengthens your claim that you are a legal occupier, not a trespasser.\n*   **Are you vulnerable?** Yes. Because you do not pay rent, you lack the security of an Assured Shorthold Tenancy. The new owner can likely evict you relatively quickly compared to a paying tenant, but they still must follow the court process.\n\n### Immediate Steps to Take\n1.  **Do not leave voluntarily** until you have spoken to a professional. If you leave, you may lose your rights to return.\n2.  **Contact Shelter:** Shelter is a UK housing charity that offers free legal advice. They have a helpline (0808 800 4444) and are experts in this exact type of situation.\n3.  **Communicate with the new owner:** Inform them in writing that you have occupied the property for 10 years, your belongings are there, and you require proper legal notice to vacate.\n4.  **Gather Evidence:** Find any proof you have of living there for 10 years (old bills, letters, bank statements, or even the text message from the buyer acknowledging your belongings were there).\n\n**Bottom Line:** The new owner cannot simply kick you out. However, because you do not pay rent, they can likely evict you through the courts much faster than a standard tenant. You need legal advice to determine exactly how much notice you are entitled to.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 150, "completion_tokens": 3993, "total_tokens": 4143}, "latency_s": 313.2114912089892, "request_id": "chatcmpl-b5240c0fc91dc0b0", "raw_response": null}
