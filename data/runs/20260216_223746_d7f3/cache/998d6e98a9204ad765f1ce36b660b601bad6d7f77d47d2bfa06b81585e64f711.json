Under section 1.D, it states: 'If the defendant invokes the arbitration agreement, German courts typically must refer parties to arbitration unless the agreement is null/void/inoperative/incapable of being performed.' Furthermore, section 2.E discusses seeking an 'English anti-suit injunction' if German proceedings are filed, and section 4 details the playbook for 'If they file in Germany,' which includes appearing only to contest jurisdiction and seeking referral to arbitration. This directly satisfies the requirement that the response identifies that if the German Distributor attempts to file in court, they will be in breach of the arbitration agreement, and a German court should dismiss or stay the action.\", \"criterion_id\": \"50faad98-d961-4c12-a76b-ce59b94c7973\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3283, "completion_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 3488}, "latency_s": 1.4255915409885347, "request_id": "6x6VaabeFvKcnsEPtfCWuQg", "raw_response": null}
