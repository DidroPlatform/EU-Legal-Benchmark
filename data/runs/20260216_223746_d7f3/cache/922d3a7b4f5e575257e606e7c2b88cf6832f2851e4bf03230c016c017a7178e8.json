Statement iv is incorrect: Gustave Moynier did not write 'Das moderne Kriegsrecht' in 1866; this work is attributed to Johann Caspar Bluntschli. Statement v is incorrect: when a party successfully challenges legislation indirectly (concrete review), only the administrative decision is annulled, not the underlying legal provision itself. Statements i and iii are correct: acts of the Federal Assembly can be challenged for constitutional review, and the Helvetic Republic did restore confederate structures (though with modifications). Therefore, statements ii, iv, and v are incorrect.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 397, "completion_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 581}, "latency_s": 3.02842195899575, "request_id": "chatcmpl-310e4504-5d9c-4af9-936d-b31cd111340e", "raw_response": null}
