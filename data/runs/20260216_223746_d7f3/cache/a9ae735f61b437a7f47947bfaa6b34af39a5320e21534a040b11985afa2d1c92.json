The main risks are (1) **title/encumbrances**, (2) **planning/building compliance**, (3) **condominium and tax debts**, (4) **mortgage/financing timing**, and (5) **unclear terms** about what’s included and when you get possession.\n\nBelow is a practical checklist of what to verify and what to insist is written into the compromesso.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Pick the right professional(s) early\n### Notary (notaio)\nIn Italy the **notary** is crucial, but note: the notary is a public officer who ensures legality of the deed; they are not “your” lawyer. You can (and should) **choose your own notary**.\n\n### Your own independent advisor (recommended)\nIf you’re worried about hidden risks, consider hiring:\n- a **real-estate lawyer (avvocato)** for contract drafting/negotiation, and/or\n- a **geometra/architect/engineer** to check planning and building conformity.\n\nThis often costs far less than fixing a problem later.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Title, mortgages, liens, and “who really owns it”\nBefore signing, obtain or have your notary/lawyer obtain updated searches at the **Conservatoria / Registri Immobiliari** (land registry) to confirm:\n\n- **Seller is the legal owner** and can sell (watch for inheritances not perfected, usufruct, multiple heirs).\n- **Mortgages (ipoteche)**: bank mortgages are common. It’s fine if there’s a mortgage *provided* the contract states it will be cancelled at/after closing (rogito) and how.\n- **Liens/attachments**: judicial seizures (pignoramenti), court claims, or other encumbrances.\n- **Servitudes/easements (servitù)**: rights of way, shared driveways, etc.\n\n**Contract tip:** If any encumbrance exists now, the compromesso should state **exactly** how and by when it will be removed, and what happens if it isn’t.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Cadastral vs. planning compliance (this is a big one)\nItaly has two “worlds” that must line up:\n\n### A) Catasto (cadastral) data\nCheck:\n- planimetria (floor plan) matches the current layout,\n- cadastral category, size, and details are correct,\n- the property is correctly registered.\n\nMismatch can delay or block closing and may require updates.\n\n### B) Urban planning / building legality (conformità urbanistica-edilizia)\nThis is often the highest hidden-risk area, especially in older homes or renovated apartments:\n- Were terraces enclosed? rooms moved? basements converted? lofts added?\n- Were permits issued and works properly finalized?\n\nIf the property is not compliant, you may face:\n- inability to legally transfer,\n- fines,\n- mandatory restoration,\n- or inability to get a mortgage.\n\n**Strongly consider** a geometra/architect to do a **document check + site inspection** before you commit, including:\n- building permits, amnesties/condoni if any,\n- certificate of habitability/occupancy (agibilità) where applicable,\n- conformity between authorized plans and actual state.\n\n**Contract tip:** Include a clause making your obligation conditional upon confirmed **cadastral and urban-planning compliance**, or require the seller to cure defects by a deadline (with clear termination rights).\n\n---\n\n## 4) Condominium (condominio) costs and liabilities (if buying an apartment)\nAsk for:\n- **statement from the building administrator (amministratore)** about:\n  - whether the seller is up to date with condominium fees,\n  - any **extraordinary works** approved or expected (facade, roof, elevator),\n  - current reserve fund situation.\n\nIn many cases, buyers can become liable for certain unpaid building charges (often relating to the current and previous year), and extraordinary works can be a major hidden cost.\n\n**Contract tip:** Require seller confirmation that fees are paid and specify who pays **already-approved extraordinary works**.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Taxes and purchase costs you should budget (hidden-cost reality check)\nBeyond the price, typical costs include:\n\n- **Notary fees** (vary by price/complexity; ask for a quote).\n- **Registration tax / VAT**:\n  - If buying from a **private seller**: usually registration tax (often 2% “prima casa” or 9% non–prima casa on cadastral value, with fixed mortgage/cadastral taxes).\n  - If buying from a **developer (impresa)**: often **VAT** applies (rates vary), plus fixed registration/mortgage/cadastral taxes.\n- **Agency fee (provvigione)** if there’s a real estate agent: often a % + VAT, commonly due when a binding agreement is reached (this can be earlier than the rogito).\n- **Surveyor/engineer costs** for checks.\n- **Mortgage costs**: bank fees, valuation (perizia), insurance, etc.\n- **Utilities activation, condominium transfers**, and sometimes **furniture/appliance** transfer costs.\n\nBecause the exact tax depends on your situation (resident/non-resident, prima casa eligibility, seller type), get a **written cost estimate** from a notary before signing.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Deposits: caparra confirmatoria vs. acconto (know what you’re paying)\nCommonly you pay a deposit at compromesso.\n\n- **Caparra confirmatoria**: if you back out without legal reason, you can lose it; if the seller backs out, they may owe you **double**. Powerful and common.\n- **Acconto prezzo** (advance on price): different legal consequences; can be harder to recover depending on circumstances.\n\n**Make sure the contract clearly labels the money** and states where/how it’s paid (traceable payment is standard).\n\n---\n\n## 7) Make the compromesso protective: key clauses to include\nConsider insisting on these (tailor with your lawyer/notary):\n\n1) **Subject to financing (mutuo)**  \n   If you need a mortgage, include a condition precedent that the deal proceeds only if you obtain financing by a set date, otherwise you can withdraw with deposit returned.\n\n2) **Clear completion (rogito) date** and what happens if delayed  \n   Include deadlines, required documents, and penalties/termination rights.\n\n3) **Delivery/possession date**  \n   Is possession at rogito, or earlier/later? Who pays utilities/condominium in between?\n\n4) **List of inclusions/exclusions**  \n   Furniture, kitchen units, appliances, fixtures, parking space, cellar, etc. Attach an inventory if needed.\n\n5) **Seller warranties**  \n   - free from encumbrances at closing,\n   - conformity (urban/cadastral),\n   - no pending disputes,\n   - systems compliance documentation where available.\n\n6) **Condition of property**  \n   “As is” is common, but you can still define what must be functioning and what defects are acknowledged.\n\n7) **Energy Performance Certificate (APE)**  \n   Usually required to be provided; ensure it’s delivered and referenced.\n\n8) **Penalties for non-performance (clausola penale)** (optional)  \n   Can help if timelines matter.\n\n---\n\n## 8) Registering (and transcribing) the preliminary contract\n### Registration (registrazione)\nA compromesso is typically **registered with the tax authority**; there are taxes/fees associated and crediting mechanisms at final deed depending on the transaction.\n\n### Transcription (trascrizione) — extra protection in some cases\nIn higher-risk scenarios (long gap to closing, renovations to be done, seller financial risk), ask about **trascrivere il preliminare** in the land registry. This can protect you if:\n- the seller later mortgages the property,\n- a creditor registers a lien,\n- the seller attempts to sell to someone else.\n\nIt costs more, but can be worth it.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Red flags to slow down\n- Seller unwilling to provide planning documents, condominium statements, or registry checks.\n- “Small” unpermitted changes (“everyone does it”)—these can become your problem.\n- Pressure to sign quickly or pay cash without traceable transfers.\n- Large time gap to rogito with no protections (no financing clause, no transcription).\n- Property bought through complicated inheritance without clear title.\n\n---\n\n## 10) What to ask for **before** signing (minimum document pack)\n- Seller ID and proof of title (atto di provenienza).\n- Cadastral extract + floor plan (visura + planimetria).\n- Building/planning documents and any amnesty records (as applicable).\n- APE (or at least confirmation it will be delivered).\n- Condominium administrator declaration (if apartment).\n- Statement of any mortgages and plan for cancellation.\n- Written breakdown of **all** purchase costs (notary estimate + agent fee terms).\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n1) whether it’s an **apartment vs. standalone house**,  \n2) **region/city**,  \n3) whether you need a **mortgage**, and  \n4) buying from **private seller vs. developer**,  \nI can give you a tighter checklist of the top 10 items and the most likely hidden costs for that scenario.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 43, "completion_tokens": 1988, "total_tokens": 2031}, "latency_s": 42.55891287498525, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJ046BBW944GG1FGB32VZ3", "raw_response": null}
