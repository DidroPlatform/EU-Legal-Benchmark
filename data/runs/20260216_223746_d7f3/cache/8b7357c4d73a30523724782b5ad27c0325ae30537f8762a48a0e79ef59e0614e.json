The candidate answer states that derivative versions (including parody) 'likely still infringe the underlying character copyright' in Italy and notes that parody/transformative use is narrower there. However, it does not explicitly mention the 'right of integrity violation' (moral rights), which is a key component of the criterion. Furthermore, it frames the mocking version as a potential parody, which in the US context it discusses extensively, but it fails to definitively state the Italian violation as described in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"7fa2efd8-305b-4b3e-b8d7-eddaaba059cd\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1157, "completion_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 1344}, "latency_s": 2.20330091699725, "request_id": "9eOUab2pIo3ZvdIPlMefqQ8", "raw_response": null}
