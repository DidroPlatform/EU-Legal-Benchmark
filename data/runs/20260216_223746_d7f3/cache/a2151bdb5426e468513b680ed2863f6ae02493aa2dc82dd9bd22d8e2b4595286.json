The candidate answer discusses 'Founder Vesting / Reverse Vesting' (A5) and explains its purpose is to align founders' incentives with the long-term exit horizon and prevent a founder from walking away with shares. While this is related to vesting and incentives, the criterion specifically mentions 'equity employees' generally, whereas the answer focuses exclusively on 'Founders'. Furthermore, the explanation provided is about aligning founders, not explicitly stating the general design purpose of leaver provisions for all equity employees (which typically includes employees who leave voluntarily or involuntarily). Therefore, the specific requirement of the criterion is not clearly met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8ad9f4f8-f366-40c3-8318-4c621a7634c3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4242, "completion_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 4448}, "latency_s": 1.8870076249586418, "request_id": "deyUaaONO8yynsEPyd_uiAQ", "raw_response": null}
