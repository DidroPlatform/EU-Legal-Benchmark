While the candidate answer discusses avoiding conflict with the tribunal/seat court (Section 3(d)) and avoiding duplication (Section 5), it does not explicitly list the risks of 'multiple court orders' or 'conflicting injunctions' as distinct risks arising from the cross-border nature of the situation, which is what the criterion specifically asks for. It focuses more on the court's *discretion* to avoid conflict rather than enumerating the *risks* of conflict.\", \"criterion_id\": \"36e47807-e2dd-46b6-912f-ace82d771cd9\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1668, "completion_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 1859}, "latency_s": 0.7245843749842606, "request_id": "EhqVaY7mJ_HXvdIP-aPZgQM", "raw_response": null}
