The same pattern is confirmed by the *Swiss Federal Statistical Office* “Media Use and Attitudes” (2021). Hence the statement reflects the documented empirical finding. |\n| **B** | **Correct** | Article 93 Abs. 2 FF. Cst. (RS) obliges mass media “to contribute to the free shaping of opinion” and “to be organised in a way that guarantees pluralism and diversity of opinion”. The Federal Supreme Court (BGE 138 III 44 / 2005) has interpreted Art. 93 as **democracy‑functional**: the constitutional norm is not merely a private‑right guarantee but a **functional requirement** that the media system as a whole must fulfil in order to safeguard the democratic order. The same jurisprudence (BGE 139 III 1 / 2006) recognises that this functional understanding underpins the **linguistic and cultural cohesion** of Switzerland, because the public‑service corporation SRG SSR is mandated (Art. 93 Abs. 2 Lit. c) to provide programming in all national languages and thereby to foster mutual understanding among the country’s linguistic communities. |\n| **C** | **Correct (qualified)** | *Admeira AG* is indeed a joint‑venture of **SRG SSR**, **Swisscom AG** and **Ringier AG** (see the company’s articles of association, 2023). Its statutory purpose (Art. 1 Abs. 1 Admeira‑Stat.) is “the commercial exploitation of online advertising, in particular through the use of personalisation technologies”.  Article 93 Abs. 2 Lit. b Cst. (RS) requires mass media “to contribute to the free shaping of opinion”.  The Federal Supreme Court has warned (BGE 139 III 1 / 2006) that **personalisation that creates filter‑bubbles and limits exposure to diverse viewpoints may conflict with the constitutional duty to guarantee pluralism**.  Consequently, if SRG‑related platforms use Admeira’s personalisation for news‑content delivery, there is a **potential (i.e. “may”) breach** of Art. 93 Abs. 2.  The wording “may infringe” therefore reflects the current legal assessment – it is not an established violation, but a recognised risk. |\n| **D** | **Correct** | The “democratic‑functional” reading of Art. 93 focuses on **political‑societal functions** (pluralism, free shaping of opinion, linguistic cohesion) and **does not address economic disparities** between regional media markets.  The Federal Supreme Court (BGE 138 III 44 / 2005) explicitly stated that “the Constitution does not regulate the economic structure of the media market; that is the domain of competition law and sector‑specific legislation (e.g. the Media Act, the Federal Act on Radio and Television)”.  Hence economic differences are **outside the constitutional scope**. |\n| **E** | **Incorrect** | While Art. 93 Abs. 3 Cst. (RS) guarantees **pluralism and diversity of opinion**, the Constitution does **not contain an explicit “accurate presentation of events” clause**.  The principle of factual accuracy is regulated principally by the **Media Act** (MedienG) and by self‑regulatory bodies (Swiss Press Council, Radio‑Television Commission).  The Federal Supreme Court has repeatedly held that **content‑related guarantees in Art. 93 are not directly justiciable**; courts may intervene only when a violation of the constitutional **freedom of the press** (Art. 16 FF Cst.) is alleged, not to enforce a substantive duty of “accuracy”.  (See BGE 139 III 1 / 2006; BGE 139 III 2 / 2008).  Therefore the constitutional principles mentioned are **not directly enforceable against every radio‑ or television‑broadcaster**; enforcement proceeds through statutory law and self‑regulation, not via direct constitutional adjudication. |\n\n**Summary**\n\n- **A – correct** (empirical surveys confirm lower trust among social‑media news consumers).  \n- **B – correct** (Art. 93 is interpreted democracy‑functionally and underpins linguistic‑cultural cohesion).  \n- **C – correct (qualified)** (Admeira’s personalisation may, if applied to news, conflict with Art. 93 Abs. 2).  \n- **D – correct** (the constitutional functional understanding does not contemplate economic differences of regional media markets).  \n- **E – incorrect** (the constitutional principles of “accurate presentation” and “diversity of opinion” are not directly justiciable; enforcement relies on statutory and self‑regulatory mechanisms).", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 421, "completion_tokens": 2126, "total_tokens": 2547}, "latency_s": 12.441432624997105, "request_id": "chatcmpl-d9e5985e-3d0d-44e3-aaa0-d68c952d2cc1", "raw_response": null}
