This follows standard ECHR reasoning structure for rejecting discrimination claims. Option D is similar but less precise in its formulation, while A and C are either too conclusory or represent a different procedural stage (prima facie examination rather than rejection).\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 400, "completion_tokens": 148, "total_tokens": 548}, "latency_s": 2.3502289160096552, "request_id": "chatcmpl-ba59699a-7251-4fa0-bde5-0096509bba88", "raw_response": null}
