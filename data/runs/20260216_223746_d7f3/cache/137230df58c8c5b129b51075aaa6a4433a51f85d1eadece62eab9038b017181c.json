INCORRECT. Switzerland's neutrality was formally recognized at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, not the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. While Westphalia recognized Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire, formal recognition of neutrality came later.\\n\\nii. INCORRECT. Swiss civil procedure applies a narrow concept of res judicata, not a broad one. Res judicata in Swiss law generally binds only the operative part (dispositif) of the judgment, not the findings of fact or legal reasoning. Findings of fact and legal assessments in prior proceedings do not become binding for subsequent disputes.\\n\\niii. This relates to the Kompetenz-Kompetenz principle. In Swiss law, arbitral tribunals can rule on their own jurisdiction, but this is subject to review by state courts (e.g., through challenge before the Federal Supreme Court under Art. 190 PILA for international arbitration, or state courts under domestic arbitration rules). So the statement that there is no possibility for scrutiny is arguably incorrect, but the principle of Kompetenz-Kompetenz does allow tribunals to make initial rulings. The statement says 'without any possibility for scrutiny by a state court' which is incorrect since Swiss law does allow court review of jurisdictional decisions. However, looking at the answer choices, I need to determine if iii is considered incorrect.\\n\\niv. INCORRECT. Legal sociology observes law from an external perspective (sociological/empirical), not from the perspective of legal doctrine. The recommendation described conflates internal legal reasoning with sociological observation, which is methodologically incorrect for legal sociology.\\n\\nv. INCORRECT. In a Swiss GmbH (limited liability company), shareholders can indeed be liable beyond their investment. Under Swiss law (Art. 795 CO), the articles of association can impose supplementary contributions (Nachschusspflichten) on shareholders. Additionally, the statement about 'commercial law preventing' liability beyond investment is misleading - while the basic principle of limited liability exists for both AG and GmbH, the GmbH specifically can have additional obligations.\\n\\nStatements i, ii, iv, and v are incorrect. This corresponds to choice C.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 553, "completion_tokens": 504, "total_tokens": 1057}, "latency_s": 11.299822165980004, "request_id": "chatcmpl-d5017945-4939-4c2f-9d3e-960ac04e6ea4", "raw_response": null}
