The candidate answer addresses this directly in Section 1, stating: \\\"Posting online (e.g., on your site, Patreon, Webtoon) doesn't waive your rights.\\\" While it doesn't explicitly say 'check the T&Cs of the platform you posted *to*', it addresses the core concept of whether posting online waived rights, which is the practical implication of T&Cs regarding user-uploaded content. More importantly, in Section 2, when discussing the TDM exception (s.29B), the answer states: \\\"Many sites ban scraping; if yours did (or you can argue implied license), it's invalid.\\\" This directly implies the user needs to check the terms/rules of the platform where they uploaded the work to see if scraping was prohibited, which is the necessary step to determine if a license was implicitly or explicitly waived/granted.\", \"criterion_id\": \"76fd6711-b3da-40f5-93ef-8652b6002774\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2339, "completion_tokens": 263, "total_tokens": 2602}, "latency_s": 0.9851703330059536, "request_id": "ZyqVaYnhPKzd7M8PqdSSsQM", "raw_response": null}
