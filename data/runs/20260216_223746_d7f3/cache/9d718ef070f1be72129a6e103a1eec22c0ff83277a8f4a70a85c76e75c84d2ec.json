The candidate answer explicitly discusses and cites both *Palmer v The Queen* [1971] AC 814 (PC) and *Beckford v The Queen* [1988] AC 130 (PC) as relevant authorities supporting the principles of self-defence, particularly regarding mistaken belief. However, the candidate answer fails to include the required advice that these Privy Council cases are not binding domestic UK precedent (though they are highly persuasive). Since the instruction was to *prepare* the brief, and the brief *must* contain this specific advice regarding precedent status, the failure to include this negative constraint/advice means the response did not fully satisfy the rubric requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"bbfa06d0-1d7b-41af-bb76-fa659eee9bd5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4278, "completion_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 4498}, "latency_s": 1.4413547920121346, "request_id": "7EmUaef2NLT4xs0Pq_qZ4QI", "raw_response": null}
