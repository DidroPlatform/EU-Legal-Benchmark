The candidate answer does not make this claim. In fact, the candidate answer explicitly discusses cases where tribunals *accepted* counterclaims based on environmental obligations, provided they were sufficiently connected to the investment treaty claim (e.g., *CMS Energy v. Argentina* and *Tethyan Copper v. Eritrea*). The response suggests that environmental claims *can* form the basis of a counterclaim if framed correctly (i.e., as a breach of a treaty obligation incorporating domestic law, or arising from the same transaction). Therefore, the criterion is not satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4039082c-276f-47cd-ad4b-06fd8b91be97\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3267, "completion_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 3450}, "latency_s": 0.6911210829857737, "request_id": "Me6UaYPvMs_c28oPsY6G4AQ", "raw_response": null}
