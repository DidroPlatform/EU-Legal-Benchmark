The candidate answer asserts the opposite, claiming that private law is the default regime for GIP staff regardless of the public service nature of the activities, citing Decree No. 2004-1005. This directly contradicts the premise established by the rubric criterion, which suggests a public law default when the mission is an administrative public service. The candidate's assertion that private law is the default for GIPs, even for public service activities, fails to acknowledge the condition specified in the criterion (SPA mission leading to public law default).\", \"criterion_id\": \"18abdf2a-eb07-4ab6-872f-df2b404b1dcb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 878, "completion_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 1071}, "latency_s": 0.6873825420043431, "request_id": "myKVaceoJNqgkdUPg_fLkAM", "raw_response": null}
