INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. We are instructed on behalf of the Defendant, who faces a charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to **section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861**. The allegation arises from a street altercation during which the Defendant struck the complainant with a piece of broken glass.\n\n2. The Defendant's account, given in conference, is as follows:\n\n   - The complainant initiated the physical confrontation by attacking the Defendant first.\n   - At the time of responding with force, the Defendant genuinely feared for his life.\n   - The Defendant believed, honestly, that the complainant was armed, although this belief subsequently proved to be mistaken.\n   - The Defendant used the broken glass to strike the complainant in what he perceived to be a necessary act of self-preservation.\n\n3. This brief analyses the Defendant's prospects of successfully advancing **self-defence** at trial, with reference to the applicable statutory framework, common law principles, and relevant case authorities.\n\n---\n\n## II. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR SELF-DEFENCE\n\n### A. Statutory Provisions\n\n#### (i) Section 76 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008\n\n4. The primary statutory codification of the law on self-defence, as it applies in England and Wales, is found in **section 76 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008** (\"CJIA 2008\"). This provision does not replace the common law but rather clarifies and supplements it. Section 76(9) expressly states that the section is intended to be compatible with, and complementary to, the existing common law on self-defence.\n\n5. Section 76 applies where the question arises whether the degree of force used by the defendant was reasonable in the circumstances. It is relevant both to the **common law defence of self-defence** and to the **statutory defence under section 3(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1967**, which permits the use of such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime.\n\n6. The key operative provisions are as follows:\n\n   - **Section 76(3):** The question whether the degree of force used by the defendant was reasonable in the circumstances is to be decided by reference to the circumstances **as the defendant believed them to be**. This is of central importance to our client's case.\n\n   - **Section 76(4):** If the defendant claims to have held a particular belief as regards the existence of any circumstances, and the claim is found to be a credible one, the defendant is entitled to rely on that belief **whether or not it was mistaken**, and, if it was mistaken, **whether or not the mistake was a reasonable one**.\n\n   - **Section 76(6):** The degree of force used by the defendant is not to be regarded as having been reasonable in the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be if it was **disproportionate** in those circumstances.\n\n   - **Section 76(7):** In deciding whether the degree of force was reasonable, the following considerations are relevant:\n     - **(a)** that a person acting for a legitimate purpose may not be able to weigh to a nicety the exact measure of any necessary action; and\n     - **(b)** that evidence of a person's having only done what the person honestly and instinctively thought was necessary for a legitimate purpose constitutes strong evidence that only reasonable action was taken.\n\n   - **Section 76(8):** Subsection (7) is not to be read as preventing other matters from being regarded as relevant to whether the degree of force was reasonable.\n\n#### (ii) Section 3(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1967\n\n7. **Section 3(1)** provides: *\"A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large.\"*\n\n8. This provision operates alongside the common law right of self-defence and is likely to be engaged on the facts of our case, given that the complainant's initial attack would itself constitute a criminal offence (assault or battery at minimum), and the Defendant's response could be characterised as force used in the prevention of that ongoing crime.\n\n### B. The Common Law Test\n\n9. At common law, the defence of self-defence requires the Defendant to satisfy two essential limbs, which are now well established:\n\n   - **Limb 1 — Necessity (the trigger):** Was the use of force necessary? That is, did the defendant honestly believe that it was necessary to use force to defend himself? This is a **subjective** question.\n\n   - **Limb 2 — Reasonableness (the response):** Was the degree of force used reasonable in the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be? This is an **objective** question, albeit assessed against the defendant's subjective perception of the facts.\n\n10. The burden of proof is critical. Once self-defence is raised on the evidence, **the burden falls on the prosecution to disprove it to the criminal standard** — that is, so that the jury is sure that the defendant was not acting in lawful self-defence: **R v Lobell [1957] 1 QB 547**; **R v Abraham [1973] 1 WLR 1270**. The defendant bears no burden of proof.\n\n---\n\n## III. DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE TWO LIMBS\n\n### A. Limb 1: Was the Use of Force Necessary? (Subjective Honest Belief)\n\n11. The first question is whether the Defendant genuinely (honestly) believed that it was necessary to use force to defend himself. This is assessed **subjectively**: the jury must consider whether the Defendant did in fact hold that belief, not whether a reasonable person would have done so.\n\n12. On the facts as instructed, the Defendant states that:\n   - He was attacked first by the complainant.\n   - He genuinely feared for his life.\n   - He believed the complainant was armed.\n\n13. If the jury accepts (or the prosecution fails to disprove) that the Defendant held this genuine belief, then the first limb is satisfied, even though the belief that the complainant was armed was factually incorrect.\n\n#### Key Case Law on Honest Belief\n\n14. **R v Williams (Gladstone) [1987] 3 All ER 411 (CA):** This is the leading authority on the relevance of an honest but mistaken belief. The Defendant intervened in what he believed was an unlawful assault on a young man, but the person he struck was in fact a plain-clothes police officer effecting a lawful arrest. The Court of Appeal (Lord Lane CJ) held that **a defendant is entitled to be judged on the facts as he honestly believed them to be**, even if that belief was mistaken and even if the mistake was unreasonable. The reasonableness or unreasonableness of the belief is relevant only insofar as it bears on the credibility of the claim that the belief was genuinely held, but it is **not** a precondition of the defence.\n\n15. **Beckford v The Queen [1988] AC 130 (PC):** The Privy Council, on appeal from Jamaica, endorsed and applied the principle in *Williams (Gladstone)*. Lord Griffiths stated: *\"A defendant is entitled to use reasonable force to protect himself, others or property. It is both good law and good sense that a man who is attacked may defend himself. It is both good law and good sense that he may do, but only do, what is objectively reasonable... but the jury should judge him against the circumstances as he honestly believed them to be.\"* His Lordship further confirmed that a genuine but mistaken belief, even if unreasonable, could ground the defence.\n\n16. **R v Owino [1996] 2 Cr App R 128 (CA):** Collins J confirmed the two-stage test, stating: *\"A person may use such force as is [objectively] reasonable in the circumstances as he [subjectively] honestly believes them to be.\"* This succinct formulation captures the interplay between the subjective and objective elements.\n\n17. These common law principles are now given statutory expression by **section 76(3) and (4) of the CJIA 2008**, as set out above.\n\n#### Application to Our Client's Case\n\n18. The Defendant's account — that he was attacked first and genuinely believed the complainant was armed — engages this principle directly. The fact that the complainant was **not** in fact armed is immaterial, provided the jury accepts that the Defendant's belief was honestly held. The prosecution would need to make the jury sure that the Defendant did not genuinely hold this belief.\n\n19. Factors that may support the credibility of the Defendant's honest belief include:\n   - The circumstances of the altercation (a street confrontation, potentially in low light or a chaotic environment).\n   - Any gestures or movements by the complainant that could have been interpreted as reaching for a weapon.\n   - The speed at which events unfolded, leaving little time for calm reflection.\n   - Any evidence of the complainant's demeanour, size, aggression, or threats made.\n\n20. Factors that the prosecution may rely upon to undermine the credibility of the belief include:\n   - Whether any independent witnesses observed the complainant making threatening gestures consistent with being armed.\n   - Whether the Defendant made any contemporaneous statements inconsistent with a genuine fear.\n   - The absence of any weapon found on or near the complainant.\n\n### B. Limb 2: Was the Force Used Reasonable? (Objective Assessment on Subjective Facts)\n\n21. Even if the Defendant's belief in the need for force was genuine, the jury must then consider whether the **degree of force** used was objectively reasonable in the circumstances **as the Defendant believed them to be**.\n\n22. This is the limb that presents the greater challenge on the facts of this case, given that the Defendant used a piece of broken glass — an object capable of inflicting very serious, potentially fatal, injury — and did in fact cause grievous bodily harm.\n\n#### Key Principles\n\n23. **Palmer v The Queen [1971] AC 814 (PC):** Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest delivered the classic statement of principle: *\"If there has been an attack so that defence is reasonably necessary, it will be recognised that a person defending himself cannot weigh to a nicety the exact measure of his necessary defensive action. If a jury thought that in a moment of unexpected anguish a person attacked had only done what he honestly and instinctively thought was necessary, that would be most potent evidence that only reasonable defensive action had been taken.\"*\n\n24. This passage was subsequently adopted by Parliament in **section 76(7)(a) and (b) of the CJIA 2008**.\n\n25. **R v Shannon (1980) 71 Cr App R 192 (CA):** The Court emphasised that the question of reasonable force is one for the jury, taking into account all the circumstances, including the nature and degree of force used, the seriousness of the threat as perceived by the defendant, and the availability (or lack thereof) of alternative courses of action.\n\n26. **R v Keane and McGrath [2010] EWCA Crim 2514:** The Court of Appeal held that while a defendant is to be judged on the facts as he believed them to be, the jury is entitled to consider whether the force used was proportionate to the threat as the defendant perceived it. The court noted that the defence of self-defence has limits: it does not extend to the use of wholly disproportionate force, even where the defendant genuinely believed he was under threat.\n\n27. **R v Ray (Steven) [2017] EWCA Crim 1391:** The Court of Appeal reiterated that the assessment of reasonableness is fact-specific and that the jury must consider the \"heat of the moment\" nature of the defendant's response. The court also confirmed that the use of a weapon does not automatically render the force unreasonable, but it is a significant factor for the jury to weigh.\n\n28. **R v Clegg [1995] 1 AC 482 (HL):** The House of Lords confirmed that if the force used is found to be excessive — that is, beyond what was reasonable in the circumstances — the defence of self-defence fails entirely. There is no \"partial\" self-defence that would reduce a charge (unlike in some other jurisdictions). This is a significant risk in our case: if the jury concludes that the use of broken glass was disproportionate, the defence fails completely.\n\n#### Application to Our Client's Case\n\n29. The critical question is whether a jury would accept that striking the complainant with a piece of broken glass was a reasonable response to the threat as the Defendant perceived it — namely, an attack by a person he believed to be armed and posing a lethal threat.\n\n30. **Factors favouring the Defendant:**\n   - If the Defendant genuinely believed the complainant was armed with a weapon capable of causing death or serious injury, then the use of a weapon in response (the broken glass) may be seen as proportionate to the perceived threat.\n   - The Defendant was responding to an attack already initiated by the complainant — he did not strike pre-emptively in circumstances where retreat was possible.\n   - The events occurred rapidly in a street altercation, and the Defendant cannot be expected to have weighed his response with precision (*Palmer*; s. 76(7) CJIA 2008).\n   - The broken glass may have been an object that came to hand in the moment, rather than a weapon brought to the scene, which would tend to support the instinctive and reactive nature of the response.\n\n31. **Factors against the Defendant:**\n   - Broken glass is an inherently dangerous weapon capable of causing life-threatening injuries. A jury may consider that its use was disproportionate even against a perceived armed attacker, particularly if the Defendant could have used less dangerous means of defence.\n   - The severity of the injuries actually inflicted (grievous bodily harm) may cause a jury to view the response as excessive.\n   - The prosecution may argue that the Defendant had the option to retreat or disengage, although it is well established that there is **no duty to retreat** in English law — the availability of retreat is merely a factor to be considered: **R v Bird [1985] 1 WLR 816 (CA)**, in which the Court of Appeal held that a defendant is not required to demonstrate an unwillingness to fight or to have retreated before using force in self-defence.\n   - If the Defendant struck the complainant multiple times or continued to use force after the threat had been neutralised, this would significantly undermine the reasonableness of the response.\n\n---\n\n## IV. THE IMPACT OF HONEST BUT MISTAKEN BELIEF — DETAILED DISCUSSION\n\n32. The Defendant's mistaken belief that the complainant was armed is a central feature of this case and warrants detailed treatment.\n\n### A. The Governing Principle\n\n33. As established in **R v Williams (Gladstone)** and **Beckford v The Queen**, and now codified in **section 76(3)–(4) of the CJIA 2008**, a defendant is to be judged on the facts as he honestly believed them to be. A mistaken belief, even an unreasonable one, can found the defence of self-defence, provided it was genuinely held.\n\n34. **Section 76(4)(b)** is explicit: if the belief was mistaken, it does not matter whether the mistake was a reasonable one. However, the less reasonable the alleged belief, the less likely a jury is to accept that it was genuinely held. The reasonableness of the mistake is therefore relevant to **credibility**, not to **legal entitlement**.\n\n### B. Distinction from Intoxicated Mistakes\n\n35. It should be noted that **section 76(5) of the CJIA 2008** provides that the entitlement to rely on a mistaken belief does **not** extend to a mistake that is **attributable to intoxication that was voluntarily induced**. This reflects the decision in **R v O'Grady [1987] QB 995** and **R v Hatton [2005] EWCA Crim 2951**. We should confirm with the Defendant that he was not intoxicated at the time of the incident, as this could be fatal to the defence if the mistaken belief about the weapon is attributable to voluntary intoxication.\n\n### C. The Interaction Between Mistaken Belief and Proportionality\n\n36. The honest but mistaken belief affects the proportionality assessment in a significant way. The jury must assess whether the force used was reasonable **in the circumstances as the Defendant believed them to be** — that is, in a situation where the complainant was armed and posing a lethal threat. This is a far more favourable basis for the proportionality assessment than the actual circumstances (an unarmed attacker).\n\n37. In **R v Williams (Gladstone)**, Lord Lane CJ made clear that the entire self-defence analysis — both the necessity for force and the reasonableness of the degree of force — must be conducted by reference to the defendant's honest belief as to the circumstances. This was affirmed in **R v Owino** and is now statutory by virtue of section 76(3).\n\n38. Thus, the question for the jury is not: *\"Was it reasonable to use broken glass against an unarmed man?\"* but rather: *\"Was it reasonable to use broken glass against a man the Defendant honestly believed to be armed and posing a lethal threat?\"* The latter formulation is significantly more favourable to the defence.\n\n### D.
