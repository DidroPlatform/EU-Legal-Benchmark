Statement ii is incorrect: the Digest (Pandects) was a comprehensive compilation of juristic writings, not a short introduction; it was the Institutes that served as a short introduction for students. Statement iii is incorrect: in Swiss civil proceedings, the principle of concentration of proceedings (Eventualmaxime) generally restricts the introduction of new facts and evidence after certain procedural stages; parties cannot always freely introduce new submissions at the main hearing without restriction. Statement iv is correct: Swiss law does not provide for limited liability partnerships (Kommanditgesellschaft is permitted under the Code of Obligations). Wait - actually, a limited liability partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) is permitted in Swiss law, so iv would be correct. But actually, 'limited liability partnership' could refer to different things. In Swiss law, the Kommanditgesellschaft (limited partnership) is permitted, but a 'limited liability partnership' as a distinct form may not exist. However, the question says 'permits the registration' - Kommanditgesellschaften are registered in the commercial register. So iv seems correct. Statement v is incorrect: Luhmann's autopoietic systems theory holds that law and politics are operationally closed, self-referential systems; the legal system does not trigger democratic impulses for political change - rather, each system operates according to its own code. So i, ii, iii, and v are incorrect, which matches option B.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 289, "completion_tokens": 361, "total_tokens": 650}, "latency_s": 8.675034792016959, "request_id": "chatcmpl-7257aa7d-d8fa-4f90-a6fd-9829fac75349", "raw_response": null}
