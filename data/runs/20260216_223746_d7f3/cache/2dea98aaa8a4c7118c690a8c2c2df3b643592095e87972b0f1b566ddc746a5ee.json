It accurately discusses the main consequence: the mandatory bid requirement (Rule 9) triggered by acquiring 40% (well above the 30% threshold). It correctly mentions the requirement for an equitable/best price, the need for a cash alternative, and the procedural rules like 'put up or shut up' and frustration rules (Rule 21). Furthermore, it correctly addresses related securities regulations like major shareholding disclosures (Transparency) and UK MAR. The discussion on the inapplicability of German/Swiss law (unless secondary listings existed) is a good addition. The structure is clear and detailed. It aligns perfectly with the core points of the reference answer (Applicability, Mandatory Bid, Equitable Price, Disclosure) while providing necessary depth on the UK Code specifics. The reference answer is very brief, and the candidate answer covers all its points comprehensively and accurately.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.95}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2677, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 2911}, "latency_s": 1.351771166024264, "request_id": "TCKVaYC4EvfonsEPuaungAQ", "raw_response": null}
