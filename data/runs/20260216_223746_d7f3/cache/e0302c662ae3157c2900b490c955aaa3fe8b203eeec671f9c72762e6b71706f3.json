{"provider": "mistral_api", "model": "mistral/magistral-medium-latest", "text": "To determine whether P&L Audit Ltd can assert the ex turpi causa defense, we must consider the principles of Swiss law governing auditor liability and the application of the ex turpi causa principle.\n\nUnder Swiss law, the liability of auditors is primarily governed by the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO). According to Art. 752 CO, auditors are liable for damage caused by their negligent or intentional breach of duty. However, this liability may be limited or excluded if the damage was caused by the intentional or grossly negligent conduct of the company's organs (Art. 752 para. 2 CO).\n\nThe ex turpi causa principle, which prevents a claimant from benefiting from their own illegal conduct, is recognized in Swiss law but applied narrowly. It is derived from general principles of law and good faith (Art. 1 and Art. 27 CC).\n\nIn this case, the claim is brought by the liquidator of Digital Assets Ltd (in liquidation) on behalf of the company’s shareholders and creditors. The liquidator is acting in the interests of innocent parties, not in the interests of the wrongdoer (Achille Taloon). Therefore, the claim is not tainted by the illegal conduct of the director.\n\nMoreover, the damage claimed (the drop in share prices and the subsequent bankruptcy) is a result of the revelation of the fraud, not the fraud itself. The auditor's alleged negligence in not detecting the fraud is a separate issue.\n\nTherefore, P&L Audit Ltd will not be able to defeat Digital Assets Ltd (in liquidation)’s claim of breach of duty of care by asserting the ex turpi causa defense.\n\nHowever, P&L Audit Ltd may argue that the damage was caused by the intentional conduct of the company's organ (the director), and thus they are not liable under Art. 752 para. 2 CO. But this is a separate defense based on the causal relationship between the auditor's breach of duty and the damage, not the ex turpi causa defense.\n\nIn conclusion, P&L Audit Ltd will not be able to defeat Digital Assets Ltd (in liquidation)’s claim of breach of duty of care by asserting the ex turpi causa defense.\n\n$\\text{Art. 752 CO}$\n$\\text{Art. 1, 27 CC}$\n\nP&L Audit Ltd will not be able to defeat Digital Assets Ltd (in liquidation)’s claim of breach of duty of care by asserting the ex turpi causa defense. The defense is not applicable because the claim is not based on the company's own illegal conduct, but rather on the auditor's alleged negligence in failing to detect the fraud perpetrated by the director. The liquidator is acting on behalf of innocent parties, and the company itself is not seeking to benefit from its own illegal conduct.\n\n$\\text{Art. 752 CO}$\n$\\text{Art. 1, 27 CC}$", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 405, "completion_tokens": 3167, "total_tokens": 3572}, "latency_s": 47.70482312497916, "request_id": "83238000dd9b4bb5a35d2ecdf8b39ffe", "raw_response": null}
