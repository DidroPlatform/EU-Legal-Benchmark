The candidate answer strongly advises *yes*, the data must be collected, but only if strict GDPR compliance measures (explicit consent, privacy notice, security) are followed, as the data is sensitive health data. The final section (Section 7) explicitly details the risks and consequences of *not* complying, which implies that non-compliance leads to detrimental legal constraints. While the primary advice is 'Yes, you must inform them,' the entire response is framed around the necessity of compliance to *avoid* legal detriment, which aligns with the spirit of the criterion (i.e., highlighting the legal danger of the processing activity if done improperly). The answer clearly outlines the legal constraints that must be avoided.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9c52f408-15e9-44d2-add2-3d7a1af550a6\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4423, "completion_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 4634}, "latency_s": 1.245205250044819, "request_id": "I-aUaa3REc7UvdIPpbuqwQ8", "raw_response": null}
