The response discusses the U.S. Fair Use defense, stating that the defense is unlikely to succeed because the shirts are 'commercial, not transformative (unless the parody is truly original).' While it mentions 'transformative,' it does not explicitly state that being transformative is the *biggest factor* of fair use, nor does it clearly define it as adding additional meaning in the context of the four factors analysis. Furthermore, the primary focus of the answer is on Italian law, and the discussion of U.S. Fair Use is secondary and concludes that the defense would likely fail, rather than explaining the core principle of the defense as the primary factor.\", \"criterion_id\": \"dce2cea9-7a4f-4ac0-bb19-36b067be1257\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2881, "completion_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 3087}, "latency_s": 0.9601254999870434, "request_id": "kQKVadrEFf367M8P1uGygAU", "raw_response": null}
