While the response focuses heavily on the Arbitration Act 1996 and jurisdictional deference, it implicitly addresses the influence of the governing law/arbitration clause by stating the court must respect the 'primacy of the arbitration clause' under the AA 1996 and that the court will 'avoid undermining the arbitration.' The entire analysis hinges on the contractual agreement to arbitrate (which dictates the governing law/seat) influencing the court's discretion under s.44 AA 1996. Specifically, the analysis is framed around the court's power to support foreign arbitration, which is directly tied to the terms of the contract establishing that foreign arbitration. Therefore, the core premise of the criterion is satisfied through the detailed discussion of deference to the arbitration agreement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8b9ea1c1-5d76-4999-98af-31210a326714\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2800, "completion_tokens": 239, "total_tokens": 3039}, "latency_s": 1.2766550410306081, "request_id": "XPqUabXWKIDHnsEPq_XX6Qg", "raw_response": null}
