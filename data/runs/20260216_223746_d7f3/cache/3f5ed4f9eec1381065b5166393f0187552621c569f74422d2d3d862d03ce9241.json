It also mentions that the AdS is tailored to the person's needs and is less invasive than total incapacity ('interdizione'). This directly contradicts the premise of the negative criterion, meaning the criterion is not satisfied (i.e., the response is correct on this point).\", \"criterion_id\": \"8cd172aa-79b6-4745-9610-d45cdac4333e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1439, "completion_tokens": 163, "total_tokens": 1602}, "latency_s": 0.5987927920068614, "request_id": "HCWVafXGJ4Tw7M8P482J-QQ", "raw_response": null}
