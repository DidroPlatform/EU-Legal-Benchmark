The candidate answer correctly identifies the fixed-price law for printed books (*Article L. 311‑1 of the Code du Livre*) but the user's query is specifically about an *e-book* published exclusively online. While the answer contrasts the e-book situation with the physical book law, the core focus of the answer shifts immediately to e-book negotiation points, which is not what this atomic criterion tests. The criterion requires the presence of the correct law regulating *physical books*. The law is mentioned, but the context provided by the answer immediately pivots away from the physical book statute to explain why it *doesn't* apply, making the recognition of the statute secondary to the main topic (e-books). However, since the statute (Article L. 311-1 of the Code du Livre) and its scope (fixed price for printed books) are explicitly stated, the criterion is technically met, even if the context is about e-books.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c2bdc5f7-9767-4b95-a5d5-0b43115866d1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4432, "completion_tokens": 274, "total_tokens": 4706}, "latency_s": 1.4091147920116782, "request_id": "N-aUabzoG7bzxs0P7LC32Q0", "raw_response": null}
