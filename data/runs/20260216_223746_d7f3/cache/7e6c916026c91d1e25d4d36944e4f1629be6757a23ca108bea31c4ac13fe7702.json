The candidate answer discusses the primacy of the law of the seat (*lex arbitri*) and cites Jan Paulsson's work on 'Arbitration Unbound: Award Detached from the Law of Its Country of Origin,' which is closely related to delocalization. However, the candidate answer frames this primarily in the context of resisting enforcement against conflicting court orders (like the Indian injunction) by asserting the primacy of the seat's law (France) over other jurisdictions, rather than explicitly framing it as the 'delocalization theory' argument against *annulment-based challenges* (which is the specific context mentioned in the criterion). While the concept is touched upon via Paulsson's citation, the explicit term or clear articulation of the theory as a defense against annulment is missing. The focus is heavily on competence-competence and seat primacy against *enforcement* challenges.\", \"criterion_id\": \"0c47ba91-5906-42ff-bc80-b47de8fb0c4e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4042, "completion_tokens": 267, "total_tokens": 4309}, "latency_s": 1.832686666981317, "request_id": "Os2UaZr2JY3znsEPmfLf8QQ", "raw_response": null}
