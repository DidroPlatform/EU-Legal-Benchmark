This makes these statements impossible to verify as true.\n\nStatement iv claims that \"Ordnungsbussen\" (administrative fines) are excluded above the relevant threshold values. However, Art. 116 AIG actually provides for administrative fines (Ordnungsbussen) for violations, and there's no general exclusion above certain thresholds - rather, the law sets maximum amounts for such fines.\n\nGiven that:\n- Statements i, ii, iii, and v reference undefined \"behaviors\" and cannot be verified as true\n- Statement iv makes a claim about exclusion of fines that contradicts the actual provisions of Art. 116 AIG\n\nAll five statements (i, ii, iii, iv, and v) appear to be false.\n\n{\"answer\": \"U\", \"reasoning\": \"All statements i-v are false: i, ii, iii, and v reference undefined behaviors that cannot be verified, while iv incorrectly claims administrative fines are excluded above certain thresholds, contrary to Art. 116 AIG provisions.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 556, "completion_tokens": 319, "total_tokens": 875}, "latency_s": 6.831688166013919, "request_id": "chatcmpl-c3bed7d4-8d42-4d88-b605-5bf1bdf58096", "raw_response": null}
