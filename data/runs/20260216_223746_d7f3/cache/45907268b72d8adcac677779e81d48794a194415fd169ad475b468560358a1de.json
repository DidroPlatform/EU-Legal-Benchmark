It states that the company is liable for commissioning, publishing, and commercially exploiting the infringing image. It then cites Section 23 CDPA 1988 (secondary infringement) regarding dealing with infringing copies in the course of business. While it doesn't use the exact phrase \\\"communicating the work to the public\\\" (which relates to Section 20/24 CDPA 1988), it clearly identifies the fizzy drink company as liable for the commercial exploitation/publication of the infringing material, which satisfies the intent of the criterion by assigning primary liability for the final public-facing act of infringement to the company.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8f6d433b-a70f-49a9-8c12-1e412a5878ec\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3492, "completion_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 3724}, "latency_s": 0.9445841669803485, "request_id": "B8CUad_5Fty8nsEPjZySgAU", "raw_response": null}
