Option A directly continues this line of reasoning by addressing the absence of a plausible legal basis for conviction and the statute of limitations under domestic law, which aligns with the focus on retroactivity and Article 7 ECHR (no punishment without law). The other options either shift to unrelated tax offenses (B), introduce general Article 7 principles without tying them to the specific facts (C), or discuss abstract retroactivity without connecting to the 1944 context (D).\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 602, "completion_tokens": 159, "total_tokens": 761}, "latency_s": 3.13667441700818, "request_id": "09747003895644bca24a7cd164af5345", "raw_response": null}
