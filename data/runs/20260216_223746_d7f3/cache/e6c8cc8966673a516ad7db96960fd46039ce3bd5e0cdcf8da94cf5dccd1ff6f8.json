Therefore, the argument *does* focus on output similarity, meaning the criterion is satisfied by the candidate *failing* to adhere to the negative constraint (i.e., the candidate's argument *does* focus on output similarity, thus the statement that the argument *would not* focus on it is false, meaning the candidate's response does not align with the constraint described in the criterion). Since the criterion describes what the argument *should not* do, and the candidate *does* do it, the candidate answer fails to meet the negative constraint implied by the criterion's description.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ad06eeb9-2ef4-4c8b-9a18-0704812d1a6a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2669, "completion_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 2961}, "latency_s": 1.3565845409757458, "request_id": "ERyVaeS3DLW5kdUPzM_0sAM", "raw_response": null}
