While the candidate answer focuses heavily on the *seat* of arbitration (Singapore) and the *Arbitration Act 1996* powers (s.44), it explicitly addresses the role of the contract in Section 2.1: 'What the arbitration clause usually says' and notes that the clause creates a 'separate, autonomous proceeding.' Furthermore, Section 6 (Likely outcomes) discusses a scenario where the arbitration clause *expressly states* that Singapore courts have exclusive jurisdiction for interim relief, which directly relates to how the contractual terms influence the court's discretion. The entire analysis is framed around respecting the parties' agreement (the contract) regarding dispute resolution, which is the core mechanism through which governing law/jurisdiction clauses influence discretion in this context.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8b9ea1c1-5d76-4999-98af-31210a326714\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3895, "completion_tokens": 239, "total_tokens": 4134}, "latency_s": 1.1464510000078008, "request_id": "zOqUacq2C6Xu7M8P4P7CkQU", "raw_response": null}
