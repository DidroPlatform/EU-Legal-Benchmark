It lists 'Factors include: time of day, nature of the area, duration, and whether the defendant took precautions' under the 'Unreasonableness' heading. While it doesn't explicitly list 'physical vs sensible interference' or 'C's extraordinary sensitivity' as separate points, 'nature of the area' directly addresses the 'character of the neighbourhood' factor, and the overall context of noise interference implies sensible interference. The inclusion of time of day and nature of the area satisfies the core requirement of outlining multiple factors analyzed by the court.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d732e274-94d8-4fa0-8a0c-8ef5d4905abe\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 782, "completion_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 960}, "latency_s": 0.8012706669978797, "request_id": "b9yUaeEes9S90g_44vaRAQ", "raw_response": null}
