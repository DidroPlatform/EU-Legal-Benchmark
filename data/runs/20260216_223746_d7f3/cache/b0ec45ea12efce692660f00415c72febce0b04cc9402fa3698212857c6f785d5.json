Incorrect: In Swiss civil proceedings, res judicata (Rechtskraft) generally applies only between the parties involved, not erga omnes (against any interested person). iv. Incorrect: According to Niklas Luhmann, the political system's code is 'power' and 'not power' (Macht/Ohnmacht), but the precise formulation is 'government/opposition' (Regierung/Opposition) in his systems theory. Thus, both ii and iv are incorrect. The other statements are correct: i (capacity of judgment is context-dependent), iii (the magic formula is a Swiss political practice), and v (default marital property regime is separation of property unless otherwise agreed).\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 539, "completion_tokens": 168, "total_tokens": 707}, "latency_s": 3.4957880419970024, "request_id": "10f7a81e672c4361bee3c118c75def6b", "raw_response": null}
