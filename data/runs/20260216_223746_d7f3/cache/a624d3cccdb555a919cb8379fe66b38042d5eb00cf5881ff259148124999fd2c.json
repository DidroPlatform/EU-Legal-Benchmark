The candidate answer explicitly addresses the truck driver (D2) and notes that D2's failure to secure the chair (an omission contrary to RTA, s 40A and Construction and Use Regulations) establishes factual causation. Furthermore, the analysis of D2's liability hinges on the initial negligent act of the unsecured load, even if legal causation for the serious injury fails due to the intervening drunk driver. The premise that the truck driver's action (omission) was negligent due to the unsecured chair is clearly established in the analysis of D2's potential liability.\", \"criterion_id\": \"532a6a76-9fd8-45eb-abe1-16d13b1eeb0a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1704, "completion_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 1900}, "latency_s": 26.191225750022568, "request_id": "jzGVacajIpzw7M8Pu9TR-AQ", "raw_response": null}
