Introduction and Context**\nThe statement attributed to Milton Friedman posits that the sole social responsibility of a business is to increase its profits. This assertion must be evaluated in light of Swiss corporate law, particularly the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO), as well as contemporary legal and societal developments regarding corporate governance and sustainability.\n\n**II. Legal Framework under Swiss Law**\n1. **Primary Duty to Shareholders (Art. 716a CO)**\n   Under Swiss law, the board of directors (Verwaltungsrat) is primarily responsible for the management and representation of the company (Art. 716a para. 1 CO). The board’s duties are generally understood to include acting in the best long-term interests of the company, which traditionally aligns with profit maximization for shareholders. However, this does not preclude consideration of broader stakeholder interests where legally mandated or where such interests align with the company’s sustainability.\n\n2. **Duty of Care and Loyalty (Art. 717 CO)**\n   The board must exercise its duties with due care (Sorgfaltspflicht) and loyalty (Treuepflicht). While profit generation is a central objective, the duty of care may extend to risk management, including reputational, environmental, and social risks. Failure to address such risks could constitute a breach of fiduciary duties, particularly if they threaten long-term profitability.\n\n3. **Stakeholder Considerations and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**\n   - **Art. 964a–964c CO (Non-Financial Reporting)**\n     Since 2022, large Swiss companies are required to report on non-financial matters, including environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues (Art. 964a CO). This reflects a legal recognition that corporate activities have broader societal impacts, which must be disclosed to stakeholders.\n   - **Art. 716a para. 2 CO (Sustainability in Corporate Governance)**\n     The board must ensure the company’s long-term success, which may necessitate balancing profit motives with sustainability considerations. While not explicitly mandating CSR, this provision allows for a broader interpretation of corporate purpose.\n   - **Art. 2 Civil Code (Good Faith and Public Policy)**\n     Corporate actions must comply with principles of good faith (Treu und Glauben) and public policy (ordre public). Exploitative or environmentally harmful practices, even if profitable, may conflict with these principles.\n\n4. **Recent Developments: Responsible Business Initiative and Counter-Proposal**\n   The 2020 Responsible Business Initiative (RBI) sought to impose mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence on Swiss companies. While rejected by the Swiss electorate, the counter-proposal (now in force) introduces reporting and due diligence obligations for conflict minerals and child labor (Art. 964j–964l CO). This signals a shift toward greater corporate accountability beyond profit maximization.\n\n**III. Critical Evaluation of Friedman’s Statement**\n1. **Narrow Interpretation: Profit as Sole Objective**\n   If interpreted strictly, Friedman’s view aligns with a shareholder primacy model, where corporate activities are justified only insofar as they enhance shareholder value. Under Swiss law, this perspective is partially supported by the board’s duty to act in the company’s best interests (Art. 717 CO), which historically prioritized shareholder returns.\n\n2. **Broader Interpretation: Profit as One of Several Objectives**\n   However, Swiss law increasingly recognizes that corporate success is intertwined with stakeholder interests. The following arguments challenge Friedman’s absolutist stance:\n   - **Long-Term Value Creation**: Sustainable practices may enhance long-term profitability by mitigating risks (e.g., regulatory fines, reputational damage).\n   - **Legal Compliance**: Non-financial reporting (Art. 964a CO) and due diligence obligations (Art. 964j CO) require companies to consider ESG factors, even if not directly profitable.\n   - **Ethical and Societal Expectations**: Courts and regulators may interpret fiduciary duties (Art. 717 CO) to include ethical considerations, particularly where corporate actions harm public interests.\n\n3. **Uncertainty and Judicial Discretion**\n   Swiss law does not explicitly define the \"social responsibility\" of businesses. Courts have discretion in interpreting fiduciary duties, and case law on this issue remains limited. However, the trend toward ESG integration suggests that a purely profit-driven approach may no longer suffice in all contexts.\n\n**IV. Conclusion**\nWhile Friedman’s statement reflects a traditional view of corporate purpose, Swiss law increasingly requires companies to balance profit motives with broader societal and environmental considerations. The following qualified assessment applies:\n- **Agreement in Principle**: Profit generation remains a core legal and economic objective of businesses under Swiss law.\n- **Disagreement in Absolutism**: The sole focus on profit is legally insufficient. Swiss corporate law, particularly through recent reforms (Art. 964a–964l CO) and evolving judicial interpretations, mandates consideration of non-financial factors where they impact long-term corporate success or legal compliance.\n\n**V. Recommendation for Corporate Practice**\nBoards should adopt a **dual-purpose approach**, ensuring profitability while proactively addressing ESG risks and opportunities. Failure to do so may expose directors to liability under Art. 754 CO (personal liability for breach of duties) or reputational harm.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe statement that the sole social responsibility of business is to increase profits is **too narrow under Swiss law**. While profit maximization remains a central objective, Swiss corporate law—particularly through Art. 716a, 717, and 964a–964l CO—requires companies to consider broader stakeholder interests and sustainability risks. A purely profit-driven approach may conflict with legal duties and societal expectations. Thus, the statement is **legally untenable in its absolutism**.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 141, "completion_tokens": 1266, "total_tokens": 1407}, "latency_s": 23.59750645799795, "request_id": "241cd0e1581949828b35103a05a5a540", "raw_response": null}
