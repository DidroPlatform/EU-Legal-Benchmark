It focuses heavily on the competence-competence principle (the tribunal's authority to rule on its own jurisdiction, which is a jurisdictional matter) and cites precedents (*BG Group*, *Yusuf Ahmed Alghanim*) supporting deference to the tribunal's jurisdictional findings. It frames the defense against the Article V(1)(a) challenge (lack of jurisdiction) as requiring deference to the tribunal's prior ruling on that very issue, contrasting this with the merits of the underlying dispute, which are not subject to review. The entire structure revolves around defending the *validity of the tribunal's authority* (jurisdiction) rather than re-litigating the substantive claims (merits).\", \"criterion_id\": \"e92f1752-19b6-4afc-9ea1-4277c9bf6cc0\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4032, "completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 4234}, "latency_s": 2.0326837500033434, "request_id": "CM2UaYuHMPCMkdUPn6WNwAE", "raw_response": null}
