The candidate answer discusses Article V(1)(a) (jurisdiction) and Article V(1)(b) (due process) extensively, and mentions Article V(1)(e) only in the context of distinguishing the primary jurisdiction of the seat court regarding annulment/suspension (Section 3C). It does not explicitly state that V(1)(e) is the ground for refusal if the award is set aside at the seat. Since the prompt scenario involves resisting enforcement based on jurisdiction and due process objections (which map to V(1)(a) and V(1)(b)), the candidate focused on those, but failed to address the specific requirement of the criterion regarding V(1)(e).\", \"criterion_id\": \"4e27ec7e-c6c3-4702-94e3-c62fdc7b481d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3172, "completion_tokens": 237, "total_tokens": 3409}, "latency_s": 3.8571617910056375, "request_id": "RxqVaeL7HpjknsEPxt7C0AU", "raw_response": null}
