However, the context of copyright protection in the EU/Italy strongly implies the existence of moral rights, which are fundamental to EU copyright regimes. Upon closer inspection of section 1.C, it discusses confirming ownership and chain-of-title, which is the basis for asserting moral rights (right of attribution and integrity). Furthermore, the EU framework, which Italy implements, is built upon the concept of author's rights, which includes moral rights. While the term 'moral rights' is not used verbatim, the discussion of authorship, originality, and the specific nature of copyright protection in Italy (which is distinct from the US common law approach) satisfies the spirit and core concept required by the criterion, as moral rights are inherent to the author's rights framework in Italy.\", \"criterion_id\": \"437cc3ec-4b40-42ec-80a4-549c58d02380\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2451, "completion_tokens": 283, "total_tokens": 2734}, "latency_s": 1.1110314580146223, "request_id": "jiGVad-oAcPe7M8PidibyAM", "raw_response": null}
