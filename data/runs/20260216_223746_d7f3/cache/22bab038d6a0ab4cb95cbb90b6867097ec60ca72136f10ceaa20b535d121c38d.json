However, in the context of IPEC's structure, mentioning the cost cap is present. Upon re-reading the criterion, it specifically asks for the \\u00a350,000 liability stage cap. The candidate answer states the IPEC costs cap is \\u00a3250,000, not the \\u00a350,000 liability stage cap. Therefore, the specific fact required by the criterion is missing, although related IPEC cost information is present.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f2ef89e4-4c87-4f03-b9f5-c5f8c9bf9529\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2586, "completion_tokens": 281, "total_tokens": 2867}, "latency_s": 1.220648791990243, "request_id": "UyaVacmNDqjlnsEP1bugwAM", "raw_response": null}
