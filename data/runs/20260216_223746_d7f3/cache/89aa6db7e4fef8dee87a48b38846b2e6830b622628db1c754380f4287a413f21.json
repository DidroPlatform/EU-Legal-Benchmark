Instead, it uses §47 to describe the default majority voting structure that the SHA must override. The response fails to clearly cite §47 as the basis for *establishing* veto rights, which is the core requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"55f8f885-98e6-4441-8a5f-0a326e1daecf\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3472, "completion_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 3691}, "latency_s": 0.8912771249888465, "request_id": "0fuUabK-BIKN7M8Pn42j8Qg", "raw_response": null}
