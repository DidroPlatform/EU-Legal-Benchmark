Thus, the defendant\\u2019s actions were a **substantial and operating cause** of the harm.' While it doesn't use the exact phrasing 'not the sole or primary factor,' the context of legal causation analysis, which inherently contrasts substantial cause with sole cause (especially when discussing intervening acts), sufficiently covers the required concept that the cause must be significant but not necessarily the only cause.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8b490cf7-33da-490e-815d-5f9a91daf0dd\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2051, "completion_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 2257}, "latency_s": 0.8479068339802325, "request_id": "4v6UaevfLITensEP6bbt4Ac", "raw_response": null}
