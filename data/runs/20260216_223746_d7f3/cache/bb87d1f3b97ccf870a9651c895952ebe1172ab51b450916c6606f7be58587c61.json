The candidate answer mentions infringement proceedings (Article 258 TFEU) and challenging the law in national courts with a preliminary reference (Article 267 TFEU), which are mechanisms for enforcing EU law against a Member State. However, it does not explicitly mention or outline the 'state liability framework' (based on *Francovich* and subsequent case law), which is the specific legal mechanism where an individual can claim damages from a Member State for failure to implement or correctly apply EU law.
