The candidate answer discusses transparency, reporting, and various enforcement mechanisms like penalties, audits, and private rights of action (Section 2, Civil/Administrative Liability). While the mention of 'Civil/Administrative Liability' suggests employees can sue if a gap is revealed and the employer cannot justify it, this is a description of a potential legal outcome, not an explicit proposal for shifting the burden of proof standard (e.g., stating that once a prima facie case is established, the employer must prove non-discriminatory factors). The proposed blueprint (Section 3) focuses on data collection, disclosure, and external enforcement, but does not explicitly detail the legal standard for litigation regarding the burden of proof.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9345e752-06e4-47c4-a4ca-ecc719424519\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4497, "completion_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 4739}, "latency_s": 1.3521259170374833, "request_id": "pfGUaZOLMK2WkdUPiJ3nmQk", "raw_response": null}
