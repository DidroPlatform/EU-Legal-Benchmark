The candidate answer discusses tenancy rights, exclusive possession, and eviction procedures under UK housing law (Rent Act 1977, Housing Act 1988, Protection from Eviction Act 1977). It does not explicitly define or mention the legal concept of 'actual occupation' in the context of overriding interests upon the disposition (sale) of the property, which is a specific concept often related to unregistered land or overriding interests under the Land Registration Act 2002.
