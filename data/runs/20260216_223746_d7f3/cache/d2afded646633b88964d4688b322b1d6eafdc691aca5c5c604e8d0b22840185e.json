The candidate answer addresses commercial damage and the lack of a statutory exception for commercial AI training, which directly relates to the concept of 'normal exploitation'. Specifically, under section 4.3, the answer discusses remedies, including damages based on the commercial value of the infringement, and in section 6, it strongly emphasizes that the commercial purpose of the AI training defeats exceptions, implying that the use is outside normal, permitted exploitation. While it doesn't use the exact quoted phrase, the entire analysis hinges on the fact that commercial AI training is not a normal or permitted exploitation of copyrighted work under UK law, which is the core concept being tested by this criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"03e7daa7-9c1a-4107-ab25-a7c0a5db90cc\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4254, "completion_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 4466}, "latency_s": 1.1318970000138506, "request_id": "LO2UadmXKLyK7M8Ph5iNuAM", "raw_response": null}
