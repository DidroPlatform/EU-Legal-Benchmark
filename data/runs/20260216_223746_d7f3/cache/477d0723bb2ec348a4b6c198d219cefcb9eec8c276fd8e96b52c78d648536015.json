The candidate answer advises taking the money and then focuses heavily on negotiating specific clauses (neutral reference, non-disparagement, internal correction) and the client's post-settlement narrative. While it discusses reputation repair, it does not explicitly mention or leverage the concept of a short, defined window (like 30 days) immediately following the settlement announcement to execute a reputation rehabilitation strategy before the news cycle moves on. The advice is more focused on long-term narrative control and contractual protections.\", \"criterion_id\": \"aba6da4d-c621-403c-96ad-b8ebb7d7fc23\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2559, "completion_tokens": 173, "total_tokens": 2732}, "latency_s": 1.0189253750140779, "request_id": "4biUaefNOe6hnsEPsYODsAI", "raw_response": null}
