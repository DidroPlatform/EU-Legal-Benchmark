The response discusses the fixed retail price (Art. L.132-6 CPI) and the author's right to object to derisory pricing (Art. L.132-9 CPI), and mentions that there is no resale price maintenance (RPM) for e-books, allowing platforms to discount. However, it does not explicitly recommend adding a specific *promotional-pricing clause* for the author to negotiate, such as limiting discounts (e.g., 'Add a clause limiting discounts to 5% for up to 30 days with prior notice'). The advice focuses on setting the initial price and royalties, not on controlling subsequent promotional pricing mechanisms.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e4acc10a-713d-4d23-b03f-4292c71b020b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1794, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 2023}, "latency_s": 0.7963020000024699, "request_id": "EySVaYPQMvrhnsEP9oTP2Qk", "raw_response": null}
