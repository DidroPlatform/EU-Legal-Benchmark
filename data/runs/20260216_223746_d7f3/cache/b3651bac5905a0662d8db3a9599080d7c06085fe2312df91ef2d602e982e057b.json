The candidate answer focuses exclusively on the criminal liability of the drunk driver (B) and concludes that B is criminally liable. It does not discuss the potential criminal liability of the truck driver (A) or the concept of shared liability (which is more common in civil law, though joint liability for a single result can occur in criminal law, e.g., secondary participation or concurrent causation). Since the criterion specifically asks for the possibility of shared liability between the truck driver and the drunk driver, and the candidate answer omits this entirely, the criterion is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"dda864ac-b922-4cbc-89f6-414a89bd03ed\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3199, "completion_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 3406}, "latency_s": 1.0595192090258934, "request_id": "mu-UacDfOqnw7M8Pu5DvyAM", "raw_response": null}
