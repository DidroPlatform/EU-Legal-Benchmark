The candidate answer discusses Article 9(2)(i) under section 3.2, which corresponds to the public interest exception for public health, but it frames it as a *possible* basis that requires a legal act from a public authority, rather than stating it as an exception that *is* applicable or relevant in the context of the user's question (which is about whether they should have informed anyone). Crucially, the response heavily emphasizes 'Explicit consent' as the 'safest route' and does not clearly state that the 'public interest in the area of public health' is an exception that *could* apply to the user's situation, which is what the criterion asks for. It lists it, but doesn't assert it as a key exception relevant to the context.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d1ff6935-8610-4ef6-b4cf-711c3a1edebe\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4427, "completion_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 4669}, "latency_s": 5.6024580000084825, "request_id": "9eWUaZiEIpuxxN8Prb_-4Ao", "raw_response": null}
