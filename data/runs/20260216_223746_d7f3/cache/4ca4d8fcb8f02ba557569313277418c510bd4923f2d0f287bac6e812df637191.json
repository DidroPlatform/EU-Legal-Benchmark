{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"score\": 0.95, \"pass\": true, \"rationale\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the core issue: whether the *ex turpi causa* defense can defeat a liquidator's claim against an auditor for breach of duty of care, given that the company's director committed the underlying fraud. The reference answer focuses heavily on UK case law (Moore Stephens v. Stone & Rolls Ltd) and the concept of innocent shareholders/directors, which is appropriate for a common law context but less directly applicable if the candidate is applying Swiss law (as suggested by the candidate's citation of Art. 727a CO and Art. 2 ZGB).\\n\\nThe candidate answer correctly applies the principles derived from Swiss law (Art. 2 ZGB, BGE 4A_111/2009) to conclude that the defense fails because: 1) The liquidator (plaintiff) is not the wrongdoer (Achille Taloon is), and 2) The claim is based on the auditor's alleged breach of duty, not the director's fraud. This aligns perfectly with the conclusion reached in the reference answer, even though the legal framework cited is different (Swiss vs. Common Law). The reference answer's logic hinges on the presence of innocent parties (shareholders) preventing the defense, which mirrors the candidate's finding that the liquidator represents the innocent estate/creditors.\\n\\nThe candidate answer is superior because it provides a structured, legally grounded analysis based on the apparent jurisdiction (Swiss law, given the CO and ZGB citations), whereas the reference answer relies on UK precedent without explicitly stating the jurisdiction being applied. The candidate's conclusion is robust and directly addresses the prompt based on the facts provided.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.95}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1968, "completion_tokens": 379, "total_tokens": 2347}, "latency_s": 1.5575577089912258, "request_id": "IfSUacjfBdWbkdUPueCoyAM", "raw_response": null}
