The candidate answer focuses almost entirely on the possibility of recruiting *private law agents* for *delegated* tasks within a GIP (which is generally a public law entity). It mentions the GIP's status as a 'personne morale de droit public' (Section 1) and refers to the GIP's statutes, but it never explicitly states the condition that the GIP *itself* might be governed by public law due to its purpose or constitutive convention, as opposed to its default status or the status of its personnel. The answer addresses the personnel regime, not the governing law regime of the GIP itself based on its purpose.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4497b5d2-6bd3-4985-9d36-5802ba306a90\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4217, "completion_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 4428}, "latency_s": 1.3314485409646295, "request_id": "yOSUaYLHO7-ivdIPx_i58Qk", "raw_response": null}
