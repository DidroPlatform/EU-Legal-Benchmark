The candidate answer explicitly addresses this in Section 2.5 and the final summary, stating: 'The chain is broken only if an *independent, voluntary* act of a third party... occurs after the defendant\\u2019s act and becomes the *sole* cause of the result. No such act occurs... Consequently, there is **no novus actus**.' Furthermore, in the summary, it states: 'The chair\\u2019s fall is an *act of nature* and does **not** constitute a *novus actus interveniens*.' This directly addresses the concept required by the criterion, concluding that the prior act (the chair falling) does *not* break the chain, which is the correct analysis for this scenario under UK law, and thus satisfies the requirement to discuss the principle.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a9079b34-fa4a-4ba6-ab1d-a638762f1067\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3199, "completion_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 3457}, "latency_s": 1.0488132080063224, "request_id": "fO-UabDmOI65kdUPy9PImQM", "raw_response": null}
