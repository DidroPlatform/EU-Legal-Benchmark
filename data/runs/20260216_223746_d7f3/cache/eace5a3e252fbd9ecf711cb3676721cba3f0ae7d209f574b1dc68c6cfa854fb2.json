A structure *designed* to achieve a tax outcome while appearing to have business rationale is exactly what anti-avoidance rules target.\n\n2. **Triggers multiple modern anti-avoidance regimes**:\n   - GAAR (General Anti-Abuse Rule) - which explicitly catches arrangements where tax benefit is the main purpose\n   - Transfer pricing rules - which require arm's-length pricing regardless of structure\n   - Diverted profits tax - which catches profit-shifting arrangements\n   - Statutory overrides in specific areas (IP, financing, etc.)\n\n3. **Creates professional liability**: Recommending a structure I believe HMRC would successfully challenge exposes both of us.\n\n**What I can say pragmatically:**\n\nIf the client's goal is genuinely achievable, it would be through:\n- **Actual operational restructuring** (real functions, assets, risks genuinely located in Ireland)\n- **Accepting the 30-40% outcome** as the realistic tax-efficient maximum\n- **Legitimate IP migration** (with proper valuation, documentation, and genuine relocation of development)\n\n**The hard truth**: If a structure only \"works\" if HMRC doesn't scrutinize it closely, it doesn't work. And HMRC *will* scrutinize >50% profit shifts.\n\nWhat's the actual commercial driver here?
