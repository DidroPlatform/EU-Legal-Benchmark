The candidate answer proposes a 'Litigation Steering Committee (LSC) chaired by GC' in Section 3, and mentions a 'global litigation-management team (LMT) reporting to the General Counsel (GC)' in Assumption 5. However, the governance section (Section 4) details reporting to the Board's Risk & Compliance Committee (RCC) and Audit Committee, but does not explicitly detail the structure or mandate of the proposed LSC/LMT as the primary *oversight* committee chaired by the GC, which is the specific requirement of the criterion.
