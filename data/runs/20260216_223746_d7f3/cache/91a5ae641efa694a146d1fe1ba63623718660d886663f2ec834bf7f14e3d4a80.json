It only generally mentions that they must prove 'actual reputational harm occurred' and 'quantifiable damages,' which is insufficient to meet the specificity required by the criterion regarding Delaware law.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b891ecd1-29ed-48ab-b657-193a39d276ac\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2717, "completion_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 2904}, "latency_s": 1.1958973330038134, "request_id": "OdKUad_bHOLUkdUPgcXX-A4", "raw_response": null}
