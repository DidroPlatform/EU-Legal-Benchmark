The candidate answer explicitly lists the primary sources, stating: \\\"1. EU\\u2013UK Withdrawal Agreement (including the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland) - Signed: 24 Jan 2020 - Entered into force: 1 Feb 2020\\\". While the date of entry into force listed (1 Feb 2020) is the date the WA entered into force generally, the Protocol's *application* regarding the transition period ended on 31 December 2020, leading into the post-transition period governed by the Protocol. However, the candidate correctly identifies the Withdrawal Agreement and Protocol as the foundational documents and provides the date they entered into force (Feb 2020), which is the closest relevant date provided in the text for the initial legal establishment. Crucially, the answer later mentions Decision No 4/2020 adopted in Dec 2020, which set the initial 'at risk' criteria under the Protocol, confirming the operational start of the Protocol's key mechanisms post-transition. Given the context of the prompt asking for primary sources and dates, identifying the WA/Protocol and its entry into force date satisfies the spirit of noting the initial legal establishment.\", \"criterion_id\": \"478156e1-1f49-43cf-88bb-b4424f0454ba\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4099, "completion_tokens": 336, "total_tokens": 4435}, "latency_s": 1.3522482499829493, "request_id": "cSCVaezEEoqjkdUP8qvu2QQ", "raw_response": null}
