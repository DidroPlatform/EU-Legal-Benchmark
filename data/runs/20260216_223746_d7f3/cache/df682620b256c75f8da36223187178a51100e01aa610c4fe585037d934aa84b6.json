Choice C naturally follows such a heading by addressing the complaint under Article 8 (and implicitly Article 14) and explaining that, given a prior finding of a violation under another provision (Article 3 of Protocol No. 1), the Court does not need to examine this complaint separately. This is a standard ECHR approach where the Court declines to examine additional complaints after finding a violation on related grounds. The other options either deal with admissibility determinations or merits examinations that don't align with the transitional heading provided.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 570, "completion_tokens": 158, "total_tokens": 728}, "latency_s": 4.752703833015403, "request_id": "chatcmpl-95c55ca7-f43f-4fbd-a3e3-43bda4ce80be", "raw_response": null}
