The response addresses this directly in Section 2, under 'B. Your Company (Building Owner & Primary RP)', stating: 'Potential secondary liability: Failure to enforce PAT testing requirements (if you knew or should have known about the risk)' and 'Lack of coordination with the tenant company: Under FSO 2005 (Art. 22), you must cooperate and coordinate fire safety measures with other RPs.' Furthermore, the conclusion section implies shared liability despite the tenant introducing the fault. This demonstrates an understanding that the owner's primary responsibility as the RP for the building remains, even when sharing space.\", \"criterion_id\": \"61540037-65b5-4926-9628-43ec17bf3eec\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3464, "completion_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 3673}, "latency_s": 1.4684165840153582, "request_id": "XvuUaZKqJZnqkdUP3rjkuQo", "raw_response": null}
