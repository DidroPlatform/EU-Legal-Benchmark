{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 0, \"reasoning\": \"The rubric criterion explicitly requires the response to recommend a \\\"Cost Contribution Arrangement\\\" (CCA). The candidate answer recommends a \\\"Cost-Sharing Agreement\\\" (CSA) or a \\\"Profit-Split Mechanism\\\" (PSM). While CSAs and CCAs are related concepts in transfer pricing, they are distinct legal/operational structures under OECD guidelines. A CCA typically involves sharing the costs of developing an intangible asset, whereas a CSA (as described in the answer) often involves sharing the costs *and* the resulting profits/risks, which aligns more closely with the profit-split approach mentioned. Since the criterion specifically demands 'CCA' and the answer names 'CSA' (and PSM), it does not strictly meet the exact terminology required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"11c62b2c-2d60-4543-9079-6dc798b15e64\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2525, "completion_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 2729}, "latency_s": 0.8154567910241894, "request_id": "H_2Uaey5PNHMkdUPjY-7sAQ", "raw_response": null}
