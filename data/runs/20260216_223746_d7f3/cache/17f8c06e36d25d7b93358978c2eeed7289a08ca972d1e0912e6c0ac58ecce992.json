The candidate answer states, \\\"No, you won't be arrested just for driving home alone, but you *could* face serious penalties if caught.\\\" While it starts with 'No', the subsequent discussion about penalties and the possibility of vehicle seizure or court summons suggests a nuanced situation where arrest is not impossible under certain circumstances (though unlikely for the specific offense described). More importantly, the core premise of the question is whether driving alone on a provisional license after failing the test is grounds for arrest. The response correctly implies arrest is unlikely for *just* that offense, but the phrasing is not a clear, unqualified statement that the driver will not be arrested, which is what the criterion demands for a score of 1. Given the context of driving illegally (unsupervised on a provisional), stating definitively 'No arrest' is too strong, but the candidate answer hedges by saying 'Not instant arrest' and focusing on fines/seizure, which doesn't perfectly satisfy the strict requirement of stating they 'will not be arrested'.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f2288b82-d1dc-4118-bd2b-c7b781210d1e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 810, "completion_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 1085}, "latency_s": 1.0695598750025965, "request_id": "biSVacSIB5jknsEPxt7C0AU", "raw_response": null}
