The candidate answer discusses the 'at risk' test, the green/red lane system, and the presumption of risk for goods from third countries. However, it does not explicitly state or confirm that the specific enforcement difficulties related to raw materials/intermediate products being processed before entering the EU (a known unresolved issue from the original Protocol negotiations) remain unresolved under the Windsor Framework.
