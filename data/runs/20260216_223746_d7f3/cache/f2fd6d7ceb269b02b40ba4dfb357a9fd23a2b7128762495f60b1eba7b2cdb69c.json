To secure the planning, a planning zone (Planungszone) limited to two years is to be enacted. Under Swiss law (Art. 27 RPG), a planning zone can be established to secure planning when a nutzungsplan is being revised or created. The Gemeindevorstand is working on the plan change, and a 2-year planning zone is within the maximum duration allowed (typically up to 5 years under cantonal law, or 2 years under federal law with possible extension). This is a legitimate use of a planning zone to prevent developments that could undermine the planned rezoning. **Statement i is correct (zulässig).**\\n\\n**Statement ii:** T's building is in zone W5. The first attempt to raise the Wohnanteil to 90% was struck down by the Baurekursgericht due to noise issues, and that decision became legally binding. T then files a building permit on May 8, 2017, to expand his bakery into the first floor. On May 15, 2017, the city publishes a new draft revision raising the Wohnanteil to 80%. The building authority denies the permit.\\n\\nThe key question is whether the denial is lawful. The building permit was filed before the new BZO revision was publicly displayed. However, under Zurich law, a negative Vorwirkung (anticipatory effect) of pending planning can justify denying or suspending a building permit if the new plan is sufficiently concrete and the permit would contradict it. The public display (öffentliche Auflage) of the new revision happened just days after T's application. The city could potentially invoke the pending revision or enact a Planungszone. However, the previous attempt at 90% was struck down due to noise - the same noise concerns might apply to 80% as well. The Baurekursgericht found that even with technical measures, the noise situation prevented a high Wohnanteil. The new 80% requirement may face similar issues. Nevertheless, the building authority's denial based on the pending revision's anticipatory effect could be considered procedurally legitimate at this stage, even if the underlying plan might later be challenged. The question asks if the decision is \\\"rechtmässig\\\" (lawful). Given that the negative Vorwirkung doctrine applies and the new plan was being publicly displayed, the denial could be justified. **Statement ii appears correct (the denial is lawful).**\\n\\nActually, reconsidering: T currently has a lawful situation (the old 50% Wohnanteil applies since the 90% was struck down). His bakery expansion from 1/5 to 2/5 commercial use means 60% commercial, 40% residential - which violates even the current 50% Wohnanteil. Wait - actually with 4 floors residential and 1 commercial (bakery), that's 80% residential, 20% commercial. If he converts the first floor too, it becomes 3 floors residential, 2 floors commercial = 60% residential, 40% commercial. This still meets the current 50% Wohnanteil requirement. So under current law, the permit should be granted. The denial based on a not-yet-enacted revision could be problematic. But negative Vorwirkung is recognized in Swiss planning law. This is a borderline case - I'll consider statement ii as correct (denial is lawful) given the anticipatory effect doctrine.\\n\\n**Statement iii:** F claims no building permit is needed for the glass rooms. Despite being mobile and temporary (summer only), these structures are approximately 15 m² each, anchored with steel cables, used for commercial overnight stays, located outside building zones, and visible from afar. Under Swiss law, such structures constitute buildings/installations (Bauten und Anlagen) requiring a permit because they: have a fixed relationship to the ground (anchored with steel cables), are significant enough in size and impact, affect spatial planning interests (outside building zones, in untouched nature), and have environmental/landscape impacts. The fact that they can be removed doesn't eliminate the permit requirement. **Statement iii is false - F's view that no permit is needed is incorrect.**\\n\\nSo only statement iii is false.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1495, "completion_tokens": 994, "total_tokens": 2489}, "latency_s": 24.248150750005152, "request_id": "chatcmpl-2af2cc3d-2f56-4b41-bd30-fd07d5a7430e", "raw_response": null}
