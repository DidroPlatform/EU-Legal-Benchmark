The candidate answer focuses entirely on the jurisdictional admissibility of counterclaims (consent, connection, applicable law) and cites cases where environmental claims were raised (e.g., *Saluka*, *Vattenfall*, *Urbaser*). However, it never defines or discusses the *substance* of the host-state's regulatory space or the sovereign margin for legitimate regulation, which is a distinct concept from the procedural admissibility of a counterclaim based on that regulation.
