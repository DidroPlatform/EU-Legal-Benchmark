The candidate explicitly addresses this in Section 1.A, stating that the RP must 'coordinate fire safety measures' (Art. 22) and later discusses the potential liability of both the owner (primary RP) and the tenant (who may also be an RP under Art. 5) and the need for coordination (Section 3.C). This directly covers the required legal articles and the concept of shared control/cooperation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5a7e0773-5baa-4db9-ad30-8b52ad1d1305\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3476, "completion_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 3668}, "latency_s": 0.830006291042082, "request_id": "gPuUadD5PMjl7M8P9OOViAY", "raw_response": null}
