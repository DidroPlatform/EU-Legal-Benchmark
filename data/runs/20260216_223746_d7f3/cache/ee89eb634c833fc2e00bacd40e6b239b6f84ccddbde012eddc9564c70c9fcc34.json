The answer explicitly discusses 'Stronger Enforcement Models' and lists several mandatory mechanisms, including 'Proactive certification requirements' (like Iceland's model), 'Financial penalties and incentives' (fines, linking procurement eligibility), and 'Regulatory infrastructure' (dedicated agencies, regular auditing). Furthermore, under 'Evidence on Effectiveness,' it highlights that 'Salary range disclosure laws' (which is mandatory disclosure on job advertisements) show early evidence of compressing wage distributions. This directly satisfies the requirement for proposing mandatory enforcement mechanisms.\", \"criterion_id\": \"71239f09-3c08-4b68-ad2a-00016917f4aa\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1402, "completion_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 1582}, "latency_s": 0.9425412499986123, "request_id": "Z8SUaYqcOoqB7M8P4pHemAI", "raw_response": null}
