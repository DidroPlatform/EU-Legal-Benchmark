The candidate answer discusses environmental counterclaims (e.g., in *Perenco v. Ecuador* and *Urbaser v. Argentina*) and mentions the Policy government's counterclaim is based on environmental law, but it never explicitly discusses the broader trend of 'public policy integration' or the inclusion of 'sustainable development or ESG standards' as a general jurisprudential trend influencing admissibility, which is what the criterion targets.
