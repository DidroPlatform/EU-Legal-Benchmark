The optimal structure likely involves a **Brazilian holding company** as the primary seat, given Brazil's economic weight and the target's domicile, with subsidiaries in Chile and Mexico operating under a parent-subsidiary model rather than a direct statutory merger.\n\n---\n\n## I. PRIMARY SEAT DETERMINATION & CONFLICT-OF-LAW ANALYSIS\n\n### A. Jurisdictional Analysis for Primary Seat\n\n**Recommended Primary Seat: Brazil**\n\n**Rationale:**\n1. **Brazilian target company** already exists with established operations\n2. **Largest economy** in the transaction footprint (approximately 50% of Latin American GDP)\n3. **Most developed M&A legal framework** among the three jurisdictions\n4. **Regulatory familiarity** with complex cross-border structures\n5. **Treaty network** advantages (discussed below)\n\n**Alternative Considerations:**\n- **Mexico**: USMCA benefits if significant US parent involvement\n- **Chile**: Most business-friendly regulatory environment, but smallest market\n- **Luxembourg**: Holding company location, but creates additional complexity for operational headquarters\n\n### B. Conflict-of-Law Considerations\n\n#### 1. **Corporate Law Conflicts**\n\n**Incorporation Theory vs. Real Seat Doctrine:**\n\n- **Brazil**: Follows **incorporation theory** (Lei 6.404/1976, Art. 1º) - companies governed by law of incorporation jurisdiction\n- **Chile**: Primarily **incorporation theory** (Código Civil, Art. 14) with some real seat considerations\n- **Mexico**: **Incorporation theory** (Ley General de Sociedades Mercantiles, Art. 1º)\n\n**Implication**: All three jurisdictions respect foreign incorporation, facilitating parent-subsidiary structures but complicating direct statutory mergers.\n\n#### 2. **Cross-Border Merger Recognition**\n\n**Critical Issue**: None of these three jurisdictions have **bilateral merger treaties** with each other, and Latin American countries generally **do not recognize direct statutory cross-border mergers** between their domestic entities.\n\n**Practical Solution**: Structure as:\n- **Share acquisition** followed by corporate reorganization\n- **Parent-subsidiary holding structure** rather than statutory merger\n- **Asset transfers** where necessary (with attendant tax consequences)\n\n#### 3. **Applicable Legal Framework by Jurisdiction**\n\n| Aspect | Brazil | Chile | Mexico |\n|--------|--------|-------|--------|\n| **Corporate governance** | Law of incorporation | Law of incorporation | Law of incorporation |\n| **Asset transfers** | Lex rei sitae (location of assets) | Lex rei sitae | Lex rei sitae |\n| **Employment** | Local labor law (mandatory) | Local labor law (mandatory) | Local labor law (mandatory) |\n| **Contracts** | Party autonomy with limits | Party autonomy | Party autonomy |\n| **Tax** | Territorial + worldwide for residents | Territorial principle | Territorial principle |\n\n---\n\n## II.

RECOMMENDED TRANSACTION STRUCTURE\n\nGiven the legal frameworks above, a **direct statutory cross-border merger is not feasible**. Recommended structure:\n\n### Phase 1: Share Acquisition & Holding Company Formation\n\n```\nLuxembourg Investment Vehicle\n            ↓ (capital contribution)\nBrazilian NewCo (Holding Company)\n    ↓                    ↓                    ↓\nBrazilian Target    Chilean Subsidiary    Mexican Subsidiary\n(merger/acquisition)   (share purchase)    (share purchase)\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Asset and Business Integration\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Luxembourg vehicle** establishes or capitalizes **Brazilian holding company** (BrazilCo)\n\n2. **BrazilCo** acquires:\n   - Brazilian data analytics company (via statutory merger under Lei 6.404/1976)\n   - Chilean operations (via share purchase of Chilean entity)\n   - Mexican operations (via share purchase of Mexican entity)\n\n3. **Post-closing integration**:\n   - Service agreements among subsidiaries\n   - IP licensing from holding company\n   - Transfer pricing policies\n   - Shared services arrangements\n\n### Legal Mechanisms by Jurisdiction:\n\n**Brazil**: \n- Statutory merger (incorporação) under Arts. 223-227 of Lei 6.404/1976\n- Or share purchase followed by corporate reorganization\n\n**Chile**: \n- Share purchase agreement\n- Maintain Chilean SpA or SA as subsidiary\n- Possible subsequent merger with existing Chilean operations under Art. 94 of Ley 18.046\n\n**Mexico**: \n- Share purchase agreement (compraventa de acciones)\n- Maintain Mexican SA de CV as subsidiary\n- Possible subsequent merger under Arts. 222-226 LGSM (subject to 3-month waiting period)\n\n---\n\n## IV. TAX ANALYSIS\n\n### A. Profit Repatriation & Withholding Taxes\n\n#### 1. **Brazil → Luxembourg**\n\n**Domestic Law:**\n- **Dividends**: 0% WHT (Lei 9.249/1995, Art. 10) - Brazil eliminated dividend WHT in 1996\n- **Interest**: 15-25% WHT (Lei 9.779/1999); reduced rates under treaty\n- **Royalties**: 15-25% WHT; reduced under treaty\n- **Capital gains**: Generally 15-25% on gains realized by non-residents\n\n**Brazil-Luxembourg Tax Treaty** (in force since 1979):\n- **Dividends**: 15% WHT (Art. 10)\n- **Interest**: 10% WHT (Art. 11)\n- **Royalties**: 15% WHT (Art. 12)\n- **Capital gains**: Generally taxed in residence state (Art. 13)\n\n**Note**: While Brazilian domestic law imposes 0% on dividends, the **treaty rate of 15% may apply** depending on structure. However, **CVM Opinion 10/2014** and tax authority practice generally apply the **more favorable 0% domestic rate**.\n\n**Practical rate for dividends: 0%**\n\n#### 2. **Chile → Luxembourg**\n\n**Domestic Law:**\n- **Dividends**: 35% corporate tax, then additional WHT on distribution\n  - Under **Ley 20.780** (2014 reform) and **Ley 20.899** (2016):\n  - **Regime A (semi-integrated)**: 35% corporate + up to 44.45% total burden\n  - **Regime B (attributed income)**: Integrated system with credits\n- **Interest**: 35% WHT (reduced under treaties)\n- **Royalties**: 30% WHT (reduced under treaties)\n\n**Chile-Luxembourg Tax Treaty** (none exists):\n- **No bilateral treaty** between Chile and Luxembourg\n- Full domestic rates apply\n\n**Practical implications**:\n- Consider **intermediate holding** in treaty jurisdiction\n- **Spain** or **UK** (both have treaties with Chile and Luxembourg)\n- Chile-Spain treaty: 15% dividend WHT, 15% interest, 10% royalties\n- Chile-UK treaty: 15% dividend WHT, 15% interest, 10% royalties\n\n#### 3. **Mexico → Luxembourg**\n\n**Domestic Law (Ley del ISR)**:\n- **Dividends**: 10% WHT (Art. 140)\n- **Interest**: 10-40% WHT depending on type (Art. 166)\n- **Royalties**: 25-35% WHT (Art. 167)\n- **Capital gains**: 25% on certain gains (Art. 161)\n\n**Mexico-Luxembourg Tax Treaty** (in force since 2001):\n- **Dividends**: 5% WHT if beneficial owner holds ≥10%; otherwise 15% (Art. 10)\n- **Interest**: 10% WHT (Art. 11)\n- **Royalties**: 10% WHT (Art. 12)\n- **Capital gains**: Generally residence state taxation (Art. 13)\n\n**Practical rate for dividends: 5%** (assuming >10% holding)\n\n### B. Double Tax Treaty Network Summary\n\n| Route | Dividend WHT | Interest WHT | Royalty WHT | Treaty |\n|-------|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------|\n| **Brazil → Luxembourg** | 0% (domestic) | 10% | 15% | Yes (1979) |\n| **Chile → Luxembourg** | ~35%+ | 35% | 30% | **No treaty** |\n| **Mexico → Luxembourg** | 5% | 10% | 10% | Yes (2001) |\n\n### C. Luxembourg Holding Company Structure\n\n#### Advantages:\n\n1. **EU Directives** (though Latin America is outside EU):\n   - Parent-Subsidiary Directive: Not applicable\n   - Interest & Royalties Directive: Not applicable\n   \n2. **Luxembourg Domestic Benefits**:\n   - **Participation exemption**: 0% tax on dividends and capital gains if:\n     - ≥10% participation, or\n     - Acquisition cost ≥€1.2 million, AND\n     - Subsidiary subject to comparable tax (Chilean/Mexican/Brazilian entities qualify)\n   - **IP regime**: 80% exemption for qualifying IP income (post-BEPS compliant)\n   - **No WHT** on outbound dividends, interest (to non-residents), royalties\n\n3. **Treaty Network**:\n   - Luxembourg has treaties with Brazil and Mexico (not Chile)\n   - Access to EU treaty network for ultimate repatriation to US parent\n\n4. **Substance Requirements** (post-BEPS):\n   - Real office in Luxembourg\n   - Qualified directors (majority Luxembourg tax resident)\n   - Board meetings in Luxembourg\n   - Adequate staff and resources\n   - **Minimum substance**: 2-3 employees, office space, local bank accounts\n\n#### Risks & Challenges:\n\n1. **BEPS Action 6** - Treaty Shopping:\n   - Principal Purpose Test (PPT) in newer treaties\n   - Limitation on Benefits (LOB) clauses\n   - Must demonstrate **business substance** beyond tax benefits\n\n2. **ATAD Implementation** (EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive):\n   - Interest limitation rules\n   - Exit taxation\n   - GAAR (General Anti-Abuse Rule)\n   - CFC rules (may affect Luxembourg holding)\n\n3. **Chilean Route Problem**:\n   - No Chile-Luxembourg treaty creates **leakage**\n   - Consider restructuring Chilean holdings through Spain or UK\n\n4. **Transfer Pricing**:\n   - Luxembourg holding must charge **arm's length** fees for services\n   - Management fees, financing costs must be documented\n   - Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) if revenue >€750M\n\n### D. Optimal Tax Structure Recommendation\n\n```\nUS Technology Group\n        ↓\nLuxembourg HoldCo (substance required)\n        ↓\nBrazilian HoldCo (regional operational HQ)\n    ↓           ↓                    ↓\nBrazil Ops   Spanish HoldCo      Mexico Ops\n            (for Chile)\n                ↓\n            Chile Ops\n```\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Luxembourg**: Treaty benefits for Brazil/Mexico, participation exemption\n- **Brazilian HoldCo**: Regional operational headquarters, substance, local management\n- **Spanish intermediate**: Captures Chile-Spain treaty benefits (15% vs. 35%+)\n- **Substance in each**: Real operations, employees, avoid pure conduit characterization\n\n### E. Transfer Pricing Considerations\n\n**OECD Guidelines** apply (all three countries are OECD members):\n\n1. **Intercompany Agreements Required**:\n   - Management services agreements\n   - IP licensing", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 240, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 4336}, "latency_s": 67.8381781670032, "request_id": "chatcmpl-94a3ac83-4986-4d41-a214-8fbdcee6f5cf", "raw_response": null}
