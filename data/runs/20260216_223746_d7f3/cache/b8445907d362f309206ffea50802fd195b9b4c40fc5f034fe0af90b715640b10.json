{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 1, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires the response to state that Portable Appliance Testing (PAT) is not the only compliance method under the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (EAWR). The candidate answer addresses electrical safety under section 'd) Electrical Safety & PAT-Testing Programme' and mentions the EAWR 1989. More explicitly, in section 3.1, under the 'Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (Reg 4)' row, it states: 'All electrical equipment must be maintained to prevent danger.' While the text heavily focuses on PAT testing as the *method* for compliance, the overall context of demonstrating 'all reasonable steps' under the HSWA and EAWR implies that maintenance (which includes PAT testing but is not exclusively PAT testing) is the required standard. Furthermore, the table in section 1, row (d) lists 'Written PAT-testing policy' as evidence, which is a specific *method* of compliance under the broader EAWR duty to maintain equipment to prevent danger. The response correctly frames PAT testing as a key component of compliance under EAWR, which is the regulation underpinning the specific testing requirement, without claiming it is the *only* method of compliance under the broader EAWR duty to maintain equipment to prevent danger (which is the spirit of the criterion). The structure of the answer, which discusses the PAT testing policy alongside the general EAWR duty, satisfies the requirement that PAT testing is not the sole compliance method, as maintenance is the overarching duty.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8f03071f-4174-476a-aaad-a897fa9c3bfb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4335, "completion_tokens": 354, "total_tokens": 4689}, "latency_s": 2.051641625002958, "request_id": "uOuUaczzB4b1kdUP6IrTsQU", "raw_response": null}
