Tax liability (real, quantifiable)\n2. Civil wrongful death exposure (real, but contingent on proving negligence)\n3. A tax authority offering a deal that requires admitting negligence\n\nThe trap is treating these as a single optimization problem. They're not. They're governed by different legal regimes with different rules about what admissions mean.\n\n**Why this deal is more dangerous than it appears:**\n\n- A \"non-prosecution agreement\" with HMRC is not a liability shield. It's a prosecutorial discretion. It doesn't bind civil courts or create any estoppel against the wrongful death plaintiffs.\n- More critically: **an admission of knowledge of red flags isn't just evidence in civil court—it's potentially admissible in criminal proceedings against your client personally** if circumstances change or if individual executives are later targeted.\n- You're being asked to trade a financial problem (tax liability) for an evidentiary problem (a signed admission of negligence) that affects *multiple* legal proceedings you don't control.\n\n**The third way—and it's not actually hidden:**\n\n1. **Separate the tax problem from the negligence problem.** They don't have to be solved together.\n\n2. **On the tax side:** Negotiate with HMRC, but do NOT admit knowledge or negligence. Instead:\n   - Offer full cooperation on the carousel fraud network (you can do this without admitting your client knew)\n   - Offer to be a witness to what you *observed* (pricing, communications, red flags as facts, not as admissions of culpability)\n   - Negotiate the financial settlement on the basis of: \"We will pay unpaid duties and VAT, we will cooperate fully, but we will not make admissions about knowledge that create civil liability\"\n   - If HMRC won't move without the admission, that's useful information—it tells you they may not have a strong case anyway\n\n3. **On the civil side:** Your defense isn't weakened by refusing to admit negligence to tax authorities. It's strengthened. You can argue:\n   - The logistics company was sophisticated and deceptive\n   - Your client relied on their representations\n   - Industry practice didn't flag these prices as obviously fraudulent\n   - You took reasonable steps (which you should document now)\n\n4. **The leverage you actually have:** HMRC wants the carousel case. They want your client's cooperation. They don't actually need the negligence admission—they need the documents and testimony. Make them choose: do they want cooperation or an admission? Often they'll take cooperation.\n\n**The real question to ask your team:**\n\nBefore you negotiate further, you need to know:\n- What does your civil defense actually look like *without* this admission? (Is it weak? If so, the admission isn't the problem—your facts are.)\n- What's the actual range of civil exposure? (Is it truly \"bankruptcy\" or is that catastrophizing?)\n- Can you negotiate the tax settlement *separately* from the negligence question?\n\n**One more thing:**\n\nThe investigator's informal approach is a tell. If HMRC had you dead to rights on knowledge, they wouldn't need you to admit it—they'd prove it. The fact that they're asking you to hand them the admission suggests their case has gaps. Don't fill them.\n\nThe binary you're being presented with is: \"Admit negligence or face financial ruin.\" \n\nThe actual choice is: \"Negotiate separately on tax and civil liability, and don't let one proceeding dictate your admissions in another.\"\n\nWhat does your civil counsel say about your actual negligence exposure *on the facts*?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 427, "completion_tokens": 855, "total_tokens": 1282}, "latency_s": 10.70398550000391, "request_id": "chatcmpl-b1f757e6-e6c0-478e-85e7-ab4c160d0e9f", "raw_response": null}
