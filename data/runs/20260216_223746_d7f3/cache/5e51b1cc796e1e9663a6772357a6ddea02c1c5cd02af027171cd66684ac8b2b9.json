Applicable Law (Can the Tribunal Apply Domestic Environmental Law?)'. It explains that the tribunal must determine if the BIT incorporates domestic law obligations, either through an explicit reference in the applicable-law clause or through provisions referencing investor compliance with host-state law. It contrasts this with the difficulty of adjudicating a purely domestic-law counterclaim when the BIT is silent or limited to treaty obligations.

This directly satisfies the requirement of explaining the applicable law test.\", \"criterion_id\": \"47ddb755-e7f6-4ead-a8aa-80db8a87a3b9\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3335, "completion_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 3509}, "latency_s": 1.027102541003842, "request_id": "YMGUaaqXHpTlnsEP9NTwiQU", "raw_response": null}
