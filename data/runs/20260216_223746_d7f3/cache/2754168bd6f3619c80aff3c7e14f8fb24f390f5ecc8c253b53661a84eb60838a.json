The cost penalty is modest compared with the risk of a customs rejection, a possible anti‑dumping/anti‑subsidy investigation, or a VAT penalty.  \n3. If you *must* keep a single entry, you can only do it if you can prove a **single, uniform origin** under the UK‑EU “mixed‑consignment” rule (Article 9 of the UK Trade Preference Scheme). That will require a **substantial transformation** test that the Alpine’s R454B refrigerant does **not** break, plus a **single commodity‑code** for the whole container – which is unlikely.  \n4. **Liability insulation** – use a UK‑registered customs broker with a limited Power of Attorney (PoA) and a **“declaration‑only”** service agreement, backed by an indemnity clause and a “hold‑harmless” provision. Pair that with a **parent‑subsidiary “ring‑fencing”** structure (French parent → UK holding → UK import‑facilitator).  \n5. **Immediate action plan (48‑72 h)** – set up the UK entity (or register a UK branch), appoint a reputable UK customs broker, issue a PoA limited to “customs entry for PO‑XXXX”, and instruct the freight forwarder to **pre‑split** the cargo at the port (or at the warehouse) into two customs batches.  \n\nBelow is a step‑by‑step operational‑legal playbook, the customs‑technical rationale, and the contractual safeguards you need to put in place **today**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why a Single Customs Entry Is Extremely Risky\n\n| Issue | Impact if you file a single entry |\n|-------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Origin of the Alpine (R454B)** | R454B is a **controlled refrigerant** (EU/UK Regulation EU 517/2014). Its presence can trigger a **different commodity code** (e.g., 8421 90 90 vs 8421 90 10) and a **different preferential‑origin rule** because the refrigerant is not “originating” in the EU. |\n| **Mixed‑consignment rule** | The UK’s “mixed‑consignment” provision (UK Tariff Schedule, Part II, Chapter 9) allows a single origin declaration **only if** all goods are *substantially transformed* in the same country and **share the same HS‑6 code**. The Lyon and Alpine have **different HS‑6 codes** (Lyon = 8421 90 10, Alpine = 8421 90 90) and the refrigerant is a *non‑originating material* that is **added after the transformation**. |\n| **Customs rejection** | HMRC will likely reject the entry, issue a **“deemed non‑compliant”** notice, and levy **VAT penalties (up to 100 % of the VAT due)** plus possible **anti‑dumping duties** if the Alpine is deemed to be of non‑EU origin. |\n| **VAT accounting** | Under **reverse charge** the UK buyer would normally account for VAT. If you are the IOR, you must **pay UK VAT up‑front** and then reclaim it (or charge the buyer). A rejected entry means you cannot reclaim, leaving you with a cash‑flow hole. |\n| **Liability exposure** | As the IOR you become the **legal party responsible to HMRC** for classification, valuation, origin, and compliance. HMRC can pursue you for any shortfall, penalties, or customs duties – even if the UK buyer later refuses to pay. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The probability of a successful single entry is **< 10 %** given the divergent HS codes and the presence of a controlled refrigerant. The cost of a customs rejection (VAT penalties, possible customs seizure, reputational damage) far outweighs the extra freight‑forwarder fee for two entries.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Preferred Operational Structure – “UK Import‑Facilitator”\n\n### 2.1 What It Is\nA **UK‑registered limited company (or a UK branch of the French parent)** that:\n\n* Is named as the **Importer of Record** on the customs entry(s).  \n* Holds a **limited Power of Attorney (PoA)** for a **UK‑licensed customs broker** to file the entry on its behalf.  \n* Has **no commercial activity** other than receiving the goods, paying UK VAT, and passing them on to the US‑owned retailer (the “new owner”).  \n\n### 2.2 Why It Works\n| Benefit | How It Protects the French Parent |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Legal ring‑fencing** | The UK company is a separate legal person; any HMRC claim is enforceable only against that entity, not the French parent. |\n| **Limited PoA** | The broker can only act on the specific PO (e.g., “PO‑2026‑001”) and cannot bind the UK company to other customs matters. |\n| **VAT registration** | The UK entity registers for **VAT (GB #######)**, pays the import VAT, and can reclaim it on the same return (or pass it to the US buyer under a **reverse‑charge** arrangement). |\n| **No permanent staff needed** | You can use a **virtual office** and a **company formation agent**; the entity can be dormant after the import. |\n| **Contractual indemnity** | A short “Declaration‑Only Services Agreement” with the broker limits your exposure to **direct loss only** (i.e., the amount of duties/VAT actually paid). |\n\n### 2.3 How to Set It Up in 48 h\n1. **Choose a formation agent** (e.g., Companies Made Simple, Rapid Formations).  \n2. **Incorporate a UK Ltd** – name it “XYZ Imports Ltd”. Use a **registered office** in England (virtual address).  \n3. **Open a UK business bank account** (many fintechs open within 24 h – e.g., Wise Business, Revolut).  \n4. **Register for VAT** (online via HMRC – you can get a **VAT number in 2–3 days** if you provide the incorporation certificate and bank details).  \n5. **Draft a “Customs Broker Service Agreement”** (see template below) and sign a **limited PoA** (HMRC Form 28).  \n6. **Notify the US conglomerate’s legal team** that the UK entity will be the IOR; provide them with the UK VAT number and a copy of the registration certificate.  \n\n*If you already have a UK subsidiary or branch, you can skip steps 1‑4 and simply use that entity.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Customs‑Entry Options – Split vs. Single\n\n### 3.1 Option A – **Two Separate Entries** (Recommended)\n\n| Step | Action | Who Does It | Approx. Cost |\n|------|--------|-------------|--------------|\n| 1 | **Pre‑split the cargo** at the port/warehouse into two sealed pallets (70 Lyon, 30 Alpine). | Freight forwarder (request “split‑consignment” service). | £150‑£250 |\n| 2 | **Create two customs entries** (one per HS‑6 code). | UK customs broker (acting under PoA). | £120‑£180 per entry (incl. classification, origin, VAT). |\n| 3 | **Pay import VAT** on each entry (VAT = 20 % of customs value). | UK Import‑Facilitator (reclaims later). | Cash flow – reimbursed by US buyer under contract. |\n| 4 | **Issue two delivery orders** to the US buyer’s warehouse. | Freight forwarder. | No extra cost. |\n| 5 | **Close the entries** (HMRC automatically clears once duties/VAT paid). | Broker. | Included. |\n\n**Advantages**\n\n* **Clear origin proof** – each entry can be supported by its own **Certificate of Origin (CO)** (France for Lyon, France for Alpine).  \n* **No mixed‑origin risk** – HMRC treats them as distinct consignments.  \n* **VAT reclaim is straightforward** – each entry is a separate import transaction.  \n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n* **Higher freight‑forwarder fee** (splitting).  \n* **Two sets of paperwork** (but the broker handles it).  \n\n### 3.2 Option B – **Single Entry with Mixed‑Consignment Claim** (High‑Risk)\n\n| Requirement | Feasibility |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| Same HS‑6 code for both models | **No** – Lyon (8421 90 10) ≠ Alpine (8421 90 90). |\n| All goods “substantially transformed” in the EU | **Yes** for both, but the Alpine’s refrigerant is **added after transformation** (non‑originating). |\n| No controlled substances that trigger separate licensing | **No** – R454B is a **controlled refrigerant** (requires **UK REACH** registration, possible **CITES** if it were a wildlife product, but more importantly a **different duty rate**). |\n| Ability to prove a **single origin** for the whole container | **Very low** – you would need a **“single origin declaration”** supported by a **“combined certificate of origin”** signed by the French exporter covering both models, and you would have to convince HMRC that the refrigerant is “non‑essential” to the product’s essential character. HMRC case law (e.g., *HMRC v. Drax* 2020) shows they reject such mixed‑origin claims when the HS codes differ. |\n\n**Result:** *If HMRC challenges the entry, you face a possible customs refusal, a **VAT penalty of up to 100 %**, and a **potential anti‑dumping duty** on the Alpine.*  \n\n**Conclusion:** **Do not pursue Option B** unless you have a *very strong legal opinion* from a UK customs law firm that the mixed‑origin claim will be accepted – which is unlikely.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to Substantiate a Single Origin Claim (If You Must)\n\n> **Only follow this if you have a signed legal opinion from a UK customs counsel that the risk is acceptable.**\n\n1. **Obtain a **Combined Certificate of Origin** from the French exporter** that states:  \n   *“All goods described in PO‑2026‑001 (70 units of Model Lyon, 30 units of Model Alpine) are wholly obtained or substantially transformed in the EU, and the refrigerant R454B is a non‑originating material added post‑manufacture.”*  \n\n2. **Classify the entire container under the **most restrictive HS‑6 code** (the Alpine’s 8421 90 90).** This forces the customs duty to be calculated at the higher rate (if any) but avoids a “mixed‑code” rejection.  \n\n3. **Attach a **Statement of Non‑Originating Material** (SNOM) for the refrigerant** – a short declaration that the R454B is imported from a non‑EU source, its value is < 5 % of the total customs value, and it does not affect the essential character of the product.  \n\n4. **File a **“Mixed‑Consignment” declaration** (HMRC Form C88) with a **“single origin”** field ticked, and upload the combined CO, SNOM, and the **REACH registration proof** for R454B (if required).  \n\n5. **Prepare for a possible **“post‑clearance audit”** – keep all invoices, packing lists, and the refrigerant’s safety data sheet (SDS) for at least 5 years.  \n\n*Even with all this, the probability of a successful single entry is still low; the cost of a customs audit (legal fees, possible duties, VAT penalties) can easily exceed the £300‑£500 saved by not splitting.*\n\n---\n\n## 5. Insulating the French Parent from Direct Liability\n\n### 5.1 Corporate Ring‑Fencing\n\n| Layer | Entity | Role | Liability Shield |\n|-------|--------|------|-------------------|\n| **1** | **French Parent (SAS)** | Owns the IP, manufactures the goods. | No direct customs liability. |\n| **2** | **UK Import‑Facilitator Ltd** (or UK branch) | Named IOR, holds UK VAT registration, receives the goods. | Only this entity is liable to HMRC. |\n| **3** | **UK‑licensed Customs Broker** (e.g., Kuehne + Nagel, DHL Global Forwarding) | Files the customs entry under PoA. | Broker’s professional indemnity covers errors; limited PoA prevents them from acting beyond the specific PO. |\n| **4** | **Freight Forwarder** (e.g., DB Schenker) | Handles physical transport, splits the container. | No customs liability (unless they act as declarant). |\n\n### 5.2 Contractual Safeguards\n\n#### 5.2.1 “Declaration‑Only Services Agreement” (Broker)\n\n```text\nTHIS DECLARATION‑ONLY SERVICES AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is entered into as of\n[Date] between:\n\n(1) XYZ Imports Ltd, a company incorporated in England and Wales\n    (Company No. XXXXXXX), having its registered office at [Address]\n    (“Client”); and\n\n(2) [Broker Name], a customs broker authorised by HMRC\n    (Reference No. XXXXX), having its registered office at [Address]\n    (“Broker”).\n\n1. Scope of Services\n   1.1 Broker shall, solely and exclusively, prepare and lodge a customs\n        entry (C88) on behalf of Client for the shipment described in PO‑2026‑001\n        (“Goods”).  No other customs, tax, or regulatory services shall be\n        provided unless expressly agreed in writing.\n\n2. Power of Attorney\n   2.1 Client grants Broker a limited Power of Attorney (HMRC Form 28) to\n        act only for the preparation and submission of the customs entry\n        for PO‑2026‑001.  The PoA shall terminate automatically upon\n        successful clearance of the Goods.\n\n3. Indemnity & Hold‑Harmless\n   3.1 Broker shall maintain professional indemnity insurance of at least\n        £5 million covering customs‑declaration errors.\n   3.2 Broker shall indemnify and hold harmless Client from any\n        HMRC claim, penalty, or duty arising from Broker’s breach of this\n        Agreement, provided that such claim is not caused by Client’s\n        provision of false information.\n\n4. Limitation of Liability\n   4.1 Broker’s liability shall be limited to the amount of duties and VAT\n        actually paid to HMRC for the Goods, and shall not exceed the\n        insurance limit.\n\n5.
