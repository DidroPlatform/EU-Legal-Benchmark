The candidate answer lists the GAAR Defense controls under Section III. Control Point 7, 8, and 9. For Control Point 7 (Transaction Pre-Clearance), the cadence is 'Quarterly to Audit Committee'. For Control Point 8 (Commercial Rationale Testing), the cadence is 'Quarterly to Audit Committee'. For Control Point 9 (Scheme Disclosure Monitoring), the cadence is 'Quarterly to Audit Committee'. Since the GAAR Defense is composed of these three controls, and all specify a quarterly cadence to the Audit Committee, the requirement is met. However, the criterion refers to 'the GAAR Defense control' (singular), which might imply a single overarching control or the set of controls related to GAAR. Given that the structure provides three distinct controls under the GAAR Defense umbrella, and all three specify a quarterly cadence to the Audit Committee, the intent of the criterion is satisfied by the response.\", \"criterion_id\": \"31bc88c7-9bb4-4cb0-a9f5-8499628bdaf1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4020, "completion_tokens": 266, "total_tokens": 4286}, "latency_s": 1.2503478750004433, "request_id": "wNKUaePsJqXu7M8P4P7CkQU", "raw_response": null}
