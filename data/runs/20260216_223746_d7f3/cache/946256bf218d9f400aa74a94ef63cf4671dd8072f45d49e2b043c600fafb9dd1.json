The candidate answer states: 'Goods from third countries (China, etc.) arriving directly in NI are presumed at risk unless the importer can demonstrate they meet the conditions for the green lane. This means providing documentation showing the goods will stay in the NI/GB market. If you can't prove that, they go through the red lane (full checks).' This directly implies that if the importer *can* prove the goods are staying in NI (i.e., meeting the green lane conditions), they avoid the full EU checks associated with the red lane, which means they are subject only to the UK tariff/rules for internal movement, satisfying the core requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"31ba07bc-6e8b-4a21-b24c-b747c1641530\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1733, "completion_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 1961}, "latency_s": 0.9456557499943301, "request_id": "GOOUaZ2EEZiwxN8PlZ_qsQw", "raw_response": null}
