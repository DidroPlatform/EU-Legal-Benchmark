The candidate answer discusses factors like necessity, effectiveness of arbitration, connection to the UK, and comity, but it does not explicitly state or clearly imply that the fact the seat is in Singapore (outside England & Wales) is a specific ground for the English court to refuse to act (i.e., decline jurisdiction or discharge the injunction) because it is inappropriate. While factor 4 mentions 'respect for the arbitration process in Singapore,' it doesn't directly address the court's power to refuse jurisdiction based on the foreign seat being inappropriate under relevant statutory provisions (like those derived from the Arbitration Act 1996, particularly concerning support for foreign seats).\",\n\"criterion_id\": \"f319b040-3157-48dd-bb9f-24ca01953844\"\n}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 717, "completion_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 943}, "latency_s": 1.0811608340009116, "request_id": "KgqVaaSaDPnOnsEPkprNkQM", "raw_response": null}
