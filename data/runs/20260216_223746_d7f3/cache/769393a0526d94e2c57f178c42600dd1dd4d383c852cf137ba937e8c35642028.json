The analysis of the ad infringement inherently relies on this concept of conflicting with normal exploitation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"03e7daa7-9c1a-4107-ab25-a7c0a5db90cc\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2328, "completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 2530}, "latency_s": 1.0723194170277566, "request_id": "qCqVadLzNYqjkdUPl43u2QQ", "raw_response": null}
