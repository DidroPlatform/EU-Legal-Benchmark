The UK‑LP’s involvement can defeat both conditions.  \n\nBelow is the concise legal/ treaty analysis you can hand to the deal team.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Does the Dutch CV create a UK PE for the LP?\n\n| Question | Key rule | Application to the facts | Verdict |\n|----------|----------|--------------------------|---------|\n| **Is the LP a “person” of a Contracting State (UK) that can have a PE?** | Yes – a UK‑resident limited partnership is a “person” under the UK‑Netherlands and UK‑Singapore treaties. | The LP is UK‑resident (registered in England & Wales). | ✅ |\n| **Does the LP have a “fixed place of business” in the Netherlands?** | Art. 5(1) of the OECD Model (mirrored in most UK treaties) – a PE exists if the enterprise carries on business through a fixed place of business (e.g. office, workshop, factory). | The LP itself **does not** maintain an office or staff in NL. The Dutch CV is a separate legal form (commanditaire vennootschap). | ❌ (no PE *by itself*) |\n| **Is the LP a “dependent agent” of the Dutch CV in the Netherlands?** | Art. 5(5) – a PE exists if a person (other than an independent agent) habitually concludes contracts or has authority to bind the enterprise. | The LP is the **general partner** of the CV and typically has **full authority** to manage the partnership, sign licences, receive royalties, and make decisions. That authority is *not* independent – the LP acts on behalf of the CV. | ⚠️ **High risk** of a dependent‑agent PE in NL. |\n| **Is the Dutch CV a “transparent” entity for Dutch tax?** | Dutch “CV” is a *fiscally transparent* partnership – profits are allocated to partners and taxed in their hands. | The LP, as a partner, is taxed on its share of the CV’s profit in the UK. The CV itself is not a separate taxable entity. | ✅ (supports the argument that the CV is not a “separate” enterprise, but the LP’s authority still triggers PE). |\n| **Result** | The LP **does not automatically get a UK PE** just because it is a partner in a Dutch CV. However, **if the LP (as general partner) exercises management/decision‑making over the CV’s royalty‑receiving activities, the LP will be treated as a *dependent agent* of the CV in the Netherlands, creating a Dutch PE for the LP**. The UK‑Netherlands treaty would then treat the LP as having a Dutch PE, which may affect treaty benefits and UK‑SG withholding tax. |\n\n### Practical take‑aways\n- **If the LP is only a *silent* limited partner** (no management rights, no authority to bind the CV), the PE risk is negligible.  \n- **If the LP is the *general partner* with full control**, restructure: appoint a **Dutch‑resident corporate general partner** (e.g., a Dutch BV) or use a **Dutch “stichting”** as the general partner, leaving the UK‑LP as a *limited* partner only. This breaks the dependent‑agent link.  \n- Document any **management‑services agreements** that limit the LP’s authority to “advisory” only and expressly state that the LP does not conclude contracts on behalf of the CV.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Will the NL‑SG treaty benefit (reduced Singapore withholding tax on royalties) survive?\n\n### 2.1  Who is the “resident of the Netherlands” under the NL‑SG treaty?\n\n| Treaty provision (NL‑SG, Art. 4) | Requirement |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|\n| **(a) Resident of the Netherlands** – a person who is liable to tax in the Netherlands by reason of domicile, residence, place of management, or incorporation. | The Dutch CV is **incorporated** in the Netherlands and is **tax‑resident** (even if transparent, it is treated as a resident for treaty purposes). |\n| **(b) Not a resident of another Contracting State** – the same person must not be a resident of Singapore (or any other treaty partner) under that other state’s domestic law. | The CV is **not** a Singapore resident. The UK‑LP **is** a UK resident, but the treaty looks at the *entity* that receives the royalties – the CV. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The Dutch CV **qualifies as a resident of the Netherlands** for treaty purposes.\n\n### 2.2  Is the CV the **beneficial owner** of the royalties?\n\n- **Art. 14(1) (Royalties)** of the NL‑SG treaty gives a reduced rate (generally **0 %** if the beneficial owner is a resident of the Netherlands and the royalties are for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment).  \n- The CV must be the **beneficial owner** – i.e., it must have the right to receive the royalties and not be a conduit for a third party.  \n- Because the CV is a **transparent partnership**, the *beneficial ownership* is in the hands of the partners (the UK‑LP and any other partners). If the UK‑LP is the ultimate owner, the treaty still applies **provided the CV is the recipient of the payment** and the UK‑LP does not have a treaty‑benefit claim that supersedes the Dutch claim.\n\n**Result:** The CV can be treated as the beneficial owner, **provided the partnership agreement and payment instructions show the CV as the payee**.\n\n### 2.3  Anti‑abuse / Principal‑Purpose Test (PPT)\n\n- The NL‑SG treaty (signed 2005, in force 2006) contains a **PPT** (Art. 23) that denies treaty benefits if the main purpose of the arrangement is to obtain a tax advantage.  \n- Singapore’s domestic law (IRAS Circular 13/2015) also applies a **PPT** to treaty benefits.\n\n**Key factors that could trigger PPT:**\n1. **Conduit structure** – the Dutch CV exists solely to channel royalties from Singapore to the UK‑LP, with no substantive Dutch business activity.  \n2. **Lack of Dutch‑source risk** – the CV does not bear any economic risk (e.g., no R&D, no marketing, no local staff).  \n3. **The UK‑LP retains full ownership of the IP** – the CV merely holds the royalty receipt rights.  \n\nIf the Singapore tax authority (IRAS) or the Dutch tax authority (Belastingdienst) concludes that the **principal purpose** of the CV is to obtain a reduced withholding tax, the treaty benefit can be denied and the standard Singapore withholding tax (15 % on royalties) will apply.\n\n### 2.4  Interaction with the UK‑SG treaty\n\n- The UK also has a treaty with Singapore (Art. 14 provides a 0 % rate for royalties where the beneficial owner is a UK resident).  \n- If the UK‑LP were to receive the royalties directly, the UK‑SG treaty could be used instead of the NL‑SG treaty.  \n- However, the **UK‑SG treaty contains a “limitation on benefits” (LOB) clause** that may disallow the benefit if the UK‑LP is a “pass‑through” entity (i.e., a partnership) that does not have a “substantial business activity” in the UK. The LOB is less strict than the PPT but still relevant.\n\n**Bottom line:** The **NL‑SG treaty is the more attractive route** (0 % withholding) **only if** the Dutch CV is a genuine resident with real substance and the arrangement is not viewed as a pure tax‑avoidance conduit.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Overall PE & Treaty‑Benefit Risk Matrix\n\n| Scenario | UK‑LP role in CV | Dutch substance | PPT risk | Result |\n|----------|------------------|----------------|----------|--------|\n| **A. LP is *general partner* with full authority; CV has only a bank account in NL** | Dependent agent → Dutch PE for LP | Minimal (no office, staff) | **High** – conduit, no real activity | **Treaty benefit likely denied**; Singapore 15 % WHT; UK‑LP may face Dutch PE tax and UK‑NL treaty reporting. |\n| **B. LP is *limited partner* only; a Dutch BV is appointed as general partner; CV has a modest office & local accountant** | No dependent‑agent link; LP is passive | Moderate (office, staff, local management) | **Medium** – still a conduit but with substance | **Treaty benefit likely survives** (0 % SG WHT); Dutch PE risk limited to the BV (not the UK‑LP). |\n| **C. LP is *general partner* but a **service‑agreement** limits its authority to “advisory” and all contracts are signed by the Dutch BV** | Dependent‑agent risk mitigated if truly advisory; still possible PE | Moderate | **Medium‑Low** – depends on documentation | **Treaty benefit may survive** if PPT satisfied; still advisable to have Dutch GP. |\n| **D. Direct licence from UK‑LP to SG pubco (no CV)** | No NL involvement; UK‑LP directly receives royalties | N/A | **Low** – straightforward treaty claim under UK‑SG | **0 %** under UK‑SG treaty (subject to LOB). Simpler, but may expose UK‑LP to UK‑SG LOB scrutiny. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Recommendations (Actionable)\n\n1. **Re‑structure the partnership**  \n   - Appoint a **Dutch‑resident corporate general partner** (e.g., a Dutch BV) and keep the UK‑LP **only as a limited partner**.  \n   - Ensure the Dutch GP has **real substance**: a local office, at least one employee or a professional service provider, and a board that makes day‑to‑day decisions on royalty collection.  \n\n2. **Document the governance**  \n   - Draft a **Partnership Agreement** that expressly states:  \n     - The UK‑LP has *no authority* to conclude contracts or bind the CV.  \n     - All royalty‑related decisions are made by the Dutch GP.  \n   - Execute a **Management Services Agreement** between the Dutch GP and the UK‑LP that limits the UK‑LP to “advisory” services for a fee, with no authority over royalty receipt.  \n\n3. **Substance checklist for the Dutch CV** (to survive PPT):  \n   - Physical office (≥ 10 m²) in the Netherlands.  \n   - Local director(s) or manager(s) with decision‑making powers.  \n   - Local accounting/book‑keeping and a Dutch tax filing.  \n   - Evidence of **economic risk** (e.g., the CV bears the risk of non‑payment or currency fluctuation).  \n\n4. **Royalty payment flow**  \n   - Singapore licensor pays **gross royalties** to the **Dutch CV’s bank account** (clearly identified on the invoice).  \n   - The CV distributes the net amount to the UK‑LP (and any other partners) under the partnership agreement.  \n\n5. **Tax filings & reporting**  \n   - **Netherlands:** File a corporate income‑tax return for the CV (even if transparent) and a partnership return (Form IB).  \n   - **UK:** Include the LP’s share of CV profit on the UK partnership tax return (Form CT600 LP).  \n   - **Singapore:** Provide a **Form IRAS R** (or equivalent) showing the Dutch CV as the beneficial owner; retain the treaty‑benefit claim documentation.  \n\n6. **Contingency** – If the Dutch CV cannot be given sufficient substance, consider **licensing directly from the UK‑LP** and rely on the **UK‑SG treaty** (subject to its LOB). The LOB is less strict than the PPT, and the UK‑LP can claim the 0 % rate if it can demonstrate that the UK‑LP is a “resident of the United Kingdom” and the royalties are for the use of IP owned by the UK‑LP.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Quick “Yes/No” Summary for the Deal Team\n\n| Question | Answer (with caveats) |\n|----------|-----------------------|\n| **Does the Dutch CV automatically create a UK PE for the LP?** | **No**, *provided the LP is only a limited partner and does not act as a dependent agent.* If the LP is the general partner with authority, a Dutch PE is likely. |\n| **Will the NL‑SG treaty give a 0 % withholding tax on the royalties?** | **Possibly**, *if the Dutch CV is a genuine Dutch resident, is the beneficial owner of the royalties, and the arrangement passes the PPT.* A pure conduit structure will be rejected. |\n| **Is the structure safe from anti‑abuse challenges?** | **Only if** you add Dutch substance (local GP, office, staff) and limit the UK‑LP’s authority. Otherwise, high risk of treaty‑benefit denial and a Dutch PE for the LP. |\n| **Is there a simpler alternative?** | Yes – licence directly from the UK‑LP to the Singapore pubco and claim the UK‑SG treaty benefit (0 % WHT), subject to the UK‑SG LOB. This avoids the Dutch PE and PPT issues. |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom‑line for the deal team:**  \n- **Do not let the UK‑LP be the active general partner** of the Dutch CV.  \n- **Add Dutch substance** (local GP, office, staff) to survive the PPT.  \n- **Document the flow** clearly to prove the Dutch CV is the beneficial owner.  \n- If you cannot meet the substance threshold, **skip the Dutch CV** and rely on the UK‑SG treaty instead.  \n\nThat should give you the core risk assessment you need to decide whether to proceed, re‑structure, or abandon the Dutch conduit. Let me know if you need a template partnership agreement or a PPT‑risk checklist.
