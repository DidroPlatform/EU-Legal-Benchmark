RAKTA**, 508 F.2d 969 (2d Cir. 1974) (Article V defenses are to be read narrowly; strong pro‑enforcement policy).\n- **Corporación Mexicana de Mantenimiento Integral v. Pemex**, 832 F.3d 92 (2d Cir. 2016) (enforcement favored; limited review; comity and Convention policy).\n- **CBF Indústria de Gusa S/A v. AMCI Holdings, Inc.**, 850 F.3d 58 (2d Cir. 2017) (recognition/confirmation standards; limited defenses).\n\n**How to use it:** Start your brief with the Second Circuit’s “narrow defenses/heavy burden” theme and position the supplier’s arguments as disguised merits appeals.\n\n## 2) Article V(1)(a) (jurisdiction/validity): use separability + competence‑competence + delegation principles\n### A. The tribunal’s jurisdiction determination is entitled to deference when parties delegated arbitrability\nUS courts distinguish between:\n- **“Did we agree to arbitrate at all?”** (often for courts), and\n- **“Does this dispute fall within the clause / what is the clause’s scope?”** (often for arbitrators, if clearly delegated).\n\nIf the arbitration agreement (or institutional rules incorporated into it) is treated as **clear and unmistakable evidence of delegation**, US courts defer to the tribunal’s jurisdiction ruling.\n\n**Key US Supreme Court / Second Circuit building blocks:**\n- **First Options of Chicago v. Kaplan**, 514 U.S. 938 (1995) (who decides arbitrability; “clear and unmistakable” standard).\n- **Rent‑A‑Center v. Jackson**, 561 U.S. 63 (2010) (delegation clauses enforceable; separability).\n- **Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White**, 586 U.S. 63 (2019) (no “wholly groundless” exception; enforce delegation).\n- In the Second Circuit, incorporation of major institutional rules is commonly accepted as delegation (numerous district/2d Cir. decisions treat AAA/ICC/LCIA rules this way; if your clause adopts ICC Rules, emphasize ICC Art. 6 competence‑competence).\n\n**Argument structure:**\n1. The parties agreed to a clause selecting Paris seat + ICC (or similar) rules.\n2. Incorporation of those rules delegated jurisdiction questions to the tribunal.\n3. The supplier participated (even if under protest) and raised jurisdictional objections there.\n4. Under US arbitrability doctrine and Convention policy, the court should not redo the tribunal’s analysis absent a genuinely missing agreement.\n\n### B. Separability: attack on contract ≠ attack on arbitration agreement\nIf the supplier argues the broader contract was void or terminated, you can isolate the arbitration agreement.\n\n**Authorities:**\n- **Prima Paint v. Flood & Conklin**, 388 U.S. 395 (1967) (separability).\n- **Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna**, 546 U.S. 440 (2006) (validity of contract generally for arbitrator; arbitration clause survives).\n- **BG Group v. Argentina**, 572 U.S. 25 (2014) (procedural preconditions and similar issues often for arbitrators; deference to arbitral determinations).\n\n### C. “Article V(1)(a) looks to applicable law” — you can lean on the seat/selected law\nArticle V(1)(a) asks whether the parties were “under the law applicable to them” **incapable**, or the agreement invalid under the chosen law, failing which under **law of the seat**. With a Paris seat, you can argue validity under **French arbitration law’s pro‑arbitration approach**, and that the tribunal’s competence‑competence ruling aligns with the seat’s legal framework.\n\n**Tactical point:** US courts won’t conduct a full French‑law trial, but they will accept expert declarations and may treat the seat’s framework as reinforcing enforcement and limiting re‑litigation.\n\n## 3) The foreign anti‑arbitration injunction should not become an Article V defense\nIf the supplier’s story is “a foreign court enjoined the arbitration; therefore tribunal lacked jurisdiction / process was unfair,” there are several US‑friendly counterpoints:\n\n### A. No standalone “violation of a foreign injunction” defense under Article V\nArticle V lists specific defenses; **a foreign anti‑suit/anti‑arbitration injunction is not itself an Article V ground**. Attempting to shoehorn it into V(1)(a) or V(1)(b) should be resisted as inconsistent with the Convention’s narrow exceptions.\n\n### B. Comity is limited where it would undermine the arbitration agreement and Convention policy\nUS courts frequently say comity is discretionary and yields where it conflicts with strong federal policy favoring arbitration/enforcement.\n\nYou can argue: recognizing the injunction’s effect at the enforcement stage would allow an end‑run around the Convention by obtaining an order from a non‑seat court and then re‑litigating jurisdiction in New York.\n\n### C. The seat’s supervisory court is the primary “control” court\nA central Convention premise is the **seat court’s primary jurisdiction** and other courts’ **secondary jurisdiction** (enforcement courts). Even though Article V(1)(e) focuses on set‑aside/suspension at the seat, the broader structure supports an argument that **non‑seat injunctions should not control** enforcement in the US.\n\n**Helpful authority on primary vs secondary jurisdiction (US cases):**\n- **Yusuf Ahmed Alghanim & Sons v. Toys “R” Us**, 126 F.3d 15 (2d Cir. 1997) (primary vs secondary jurisdiction; enforcement courts apply Article V; seat has annulment authority under its law).\n- **Karaha Bodas Co. v. Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara (Pertamina)**, 335 F.3d 357 (5th Cir. 2003) (same concept; comity and the seat’s central role).\n\n## 4) Article V(1)(b) (due process): show notice, opportunity to be heard, and procedural fairness\nUS courts interpret Article V(1)(b) as requiring **fundamental fairness**, not perfect procedure.\n\n**Core points to establish factually:**\n- Supplier received **proper notice** of the arbitration and key filings.\n- Supplier had a **meaningful opportunity** to present its case (including jurisdiction objections).\n- Any limitations were **self‑inflicted** (they chose not to participate fully, or participated only to challenge jurisdiction).\n- The tribunal followed agreed procedures / institutional rules.\n\n**Authorities:**\n- **Iran Aircraft Indus. v. Avco**, 980 F.2d 141 (2d Cir. 1992) (due process under Convention is “notice and opportunity to be heard”; fundamental fairness).\n- **Parsons & Whittemore**, 508 F.2d 969 (2d Cir. 1974) (procedural objections narrowly viewed).\n- District court cases routinely hold that a party cannot manufacture a V(1)(b) defense by strategic non‑participation after notice.\n\n**Specific rebuttal to “injunction = due process violation”:**\n- Due process under V(1)(b) is about the **arbitration proceeding itself**, not whether a party faced conflicting legal risk elsewhere.\n- If the supplier chose not to present merits because of its own litigation posture, US courts typically treat that as a **voluntary waiver** of the opportunity to be heard, not a denial.\n\n## 5) If there was a jurisdiction fight in arbitration, argue issue‑preclusion‑like deference (not strict estoppel)\nEven if the court nominally reviews arbitrability, you can argue practical deference where:\n- The supplier **appeared** and argued jurisdiction in the ICC proceeding;\n- The tribunal issued a **reasoned decision**;\n- The supplier then tries to relitigate in New York.\n\nUS courts are cautious about strict “issue preclusion” from arbitral rulings on arbitrability, but they are receptive to:\n- waiver/forfeiture arguments,\n- the federal policy of respecting party autonomy and the tribunal’s role,\n- and the “clear delegation” doctrine.\n\n## 6) “Overlapping jurisdictions” and scholarly/comparative positions supporting deference\n### A. Competence‑competence as a widely accepted transnational norm\nMainstream international arbitration scholarship treats competence‑competence (and separability) as essential to prevent dilatory court interference.\n\n**Commonly relied texts (for citations and framing):**\n- **Gary Born**, *International Commercial Arbitration* (treats competence‑competence, separability, and pro‑enforcement policy as core; discusses court deference and parallel proceedings).\n- **Emmanuel Gaillard & John Savage (eds.)**, *Fouchard Gaillard Goldman on International Commercial Arbitration* (strong on autonomy of arbitration; French approach; limits on court interference).\n- **Redfern & Hunter on International Arbitration** (procedural autonomy, competence‑competence, interaction with national courts).\n- **Van den Berg**, *The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958* (Article V defenses narrowly construed; pro‑enforcement bias).\n\n### B. The “primary/secondary jurisdiction” framework as a comity guidepost\nScholarly commentary often frames the Convention as assigning:\n- primary control to the seat (annulment/suspension),\n- secondary enforcement to other states (recognition with limited defenses).\n\nThat structure supports resisting a non‑seat injunction’s attempt to dictate the arbitration’s legitimacy in the enforcement court.\n\n## 7) Practical enforcement strategy in SDNY/EDNY: what to build into your record\n1. **Put in the arbitration clause and rules** (highlight delegation language via ICC Rules, etc.).\n2. **Chronology** showing notice, participation opportunities, jurisdiction objections raised and decided.\n3. **Tribunal’s procedural orders** showing equal treatment and chance to be heard.\n4. **French law expert declaration** (if helpful) explaining competence‑competence and why the tribunal could proceed notwithstanding foreign injunction, and/or why the injunction doesn’t affect validity under the seat’s law.\n5. **Explain why the foreign injunction is not a Convention defense** and why comity shouldn’t override the arbitration agreement.\n\n## 8) Likely counterarguments you should be ready for\n- Supplier will argue **Article V(1)(a)** requires the US court to independently decide whether any arbitration agreement existed with respect to them (especially if they claim they never signed / wrong party / no assent). Your response: focus on evidence of assent, course of dealing, incorporation by reference, or agency/affiliate doctrines as applicable.\n- Supplier will argue **coercion/impossibility**: they couldn’t participate fully because of contempt risk abroad. Response: US due process concerns are satisfied if they had notice and opportunity; also, they could have sought relief at the seat or participated under reservation.\n\n---\n\n### If you share three specifics, I can tailor the best “deference” route and citations:\n1) What rules were incorporated (ICC/LCIA/UNCITRAL?) and exact arbitration clause text;  \n2) Did the supplier participate in the arbitration (jurisdiction phase only vs full merits) and did they appoint an arbitrator;  \n3) Where did the injunction come from (US court? supplier’s home court? a third state) and did the Paris court say anything about it.\n\n(Usual note: this is general information, not legal advice; you’ll want local counsel to validate the most on‑point SDNY/2d Cir. authorities for your fact pattern.)", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 2619, "total_tokens": 2734}, "latency_s": 59.26341354098986, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJ1PXXBR6J2BKVWAA0ZA7G", "raw_response": null}
