The response suggests calling the DVSA helpline (0300 790 6801) to confirm licence validity, which satisfies the 'visits the DVSA website or contacts' part of the criterion, although it suggests calling the helpline rather than visiting the website directly. However, the primary advice given is to call a friend/taxi/public transport, not to seek official advice first. Since it does suggest contacting the DVSA helpline, it partially meets the requirement, but the instruction implies seeking advice *instead* of driving, which is not the primary focus here. Given the strictness, I will check if it explicitly suggests visiting the website or contacting a legal professional. It suggests calling the DVSA helpline, which is contacting DVSA, thus satisfying the spirit of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"6963677d-fd0b-479e-84ba-5e6d7cce1914\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 807, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 1041}, "latency_s": 1.0277043750393204, "request_id": "mySVaaWnAb-fkdUPtcm3yAQ", "raw_response": null}
