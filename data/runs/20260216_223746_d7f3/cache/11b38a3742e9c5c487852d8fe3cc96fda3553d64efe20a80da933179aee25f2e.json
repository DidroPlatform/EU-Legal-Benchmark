It implies police action happens *if* they stop the driver, but doesn't address the threshold for the stop itself.\", \"criterion_id\": \"63f578da-4fd4-4103-bbd8-7b0446692a5b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2807, "completion_tokens": 168, "total_tokens": 2975}, "latency_s": 2.050317917019129, "request_id": "0uaUaeuEPMfxvdIPiqGnqQM", "raw_response": null}
