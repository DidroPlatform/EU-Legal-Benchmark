The candidate answer explicitly discusses this under section 3, stating: 'This is the key issue for the truck driver\\u2019s liability for the eventual serious injury.' It then outlines the argument that the drunk driver's conduct *could* be regarded as a novus actus, which would break the chain of causation, thereby preventing the truck driver from being liable for the resulting injury. Although the candidate ultimately suggests the chain might *not* break, it clearly explains the scenario where the chain *is* broken by the drunk driver's actions, which satisfies the requirement of stating what happens if the actions are considered an intervening act.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1f01980d-6a77-455d-a337-952c9912c668\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1794, "completion_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 2026}, "latency_s": 0.9501452920376323, "request_id": "mh6VafuyMduxnsEPg_7zyAU", "raw_response": null}
