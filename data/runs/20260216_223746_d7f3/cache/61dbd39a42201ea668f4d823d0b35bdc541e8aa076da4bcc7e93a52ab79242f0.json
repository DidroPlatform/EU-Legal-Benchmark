The candidate answer explicitly addresses shared premises and coordination duties, stating: 'In shared premises, RPs must coordinate (FSO Art.23). As owner, you're likely RP for the building fabric/common areas; the lessee for their area/equipment. HSE/CPS consider \\\"control\\\" and foreseeability.' Furthermore, under the 'Requirement' table, the point 'Identify RP & Scope (FSO Art.5/9; HSWA s.2)' mentions 'Named RP(s) in writing (you as owner; lessee for their space). Lease clauses requiring lessee's compliance... Joint FRA or liaison records.' While Article 5(3) (which deals with shared responsibility for premises) and Article 22 (cooperation) are not quoted verbatim, the core concept—that liability hinges on the division of control and the necessity for cooperation between dutyholders in shared premises—is clearly explained and linked to the relevant FSO articles (Art.23 is mentioned, which covers cooperation, and the discussion centers on control allocation inherent in Art.5(3)). This satisfies the intent of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5a7e0773-5baa-4db9-ad30-8b52ad1d1305\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2468, "completion_tokens": 327, "total_tokens": 2795}, "latency_s": 1.3762531249667518, "request_id": "gimVacKeGYyD7M8PobrS-Ag", "raw_response": null}
