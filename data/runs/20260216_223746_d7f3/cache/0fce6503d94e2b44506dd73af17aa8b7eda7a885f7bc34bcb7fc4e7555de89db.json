The candidate answer focuses almost entirely on the 'but for' test (factual causation) and the 'operating and substantial cause' test (legal causation), concluding that the truck driver's action (D2) is *not* a cause because the drunk driver's (D1) action breaks the chain (Novus Actus Interveniens). This analysis centers on whether the contribution was sufficient to be legally recognized, rather than explicitly discussing the concept of 'material contribution' as a distinct standard where multiple factors contribute significantly but none is the sole cause. While the analysis implies a discussion of contribution levels (substantial vs. de minimis), it fails to articulate the specific concept of 'material contribution' as requested by the rubric.\", \"criterion_id\": \"583fead6-cd77-40c7-83db-e7d8b69b2709\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1704, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 1927}, "latency_s": 40.19458474998828, "request_id": "UDGVaa-sNPTgxs0P7eGMyAU", "raw_response": null}
