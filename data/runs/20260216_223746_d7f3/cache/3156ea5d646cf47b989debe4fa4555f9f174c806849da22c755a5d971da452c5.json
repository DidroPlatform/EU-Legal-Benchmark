The candidate answer discusses the conflict between US discovery rules (FRCP 26) and EU/UK data protection laws (GDPR, DPA 2018) and notes that US courts may compel production of documents located abroad. However, it frames this as a *conflict* or *risk* (e.g., data protection breach risk, privilege waiver risk) rather than explicitly stating the uncertainty is the *enforceability of US discovery orders in the EU* (i.e., whether a German or UK court would compel compliance with a US subpoena/order, or whether the US court's order itself is enforceable abroad). While the underlying issue is present, the specific phrasing required by the criterion is not explicitly identified as the 'key uncertainty'.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3e986a45-fd40-4d19-9122-1432a8a5e47d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4287, "completion_tokens": 237, "total_tokens": 4524}, "latency_s": 1.133235249988502, "request_id": "qkqUaaXzI4O2xN8P9c6FqA8", "raw_response": null}
