Switzerland's neutrality and Peace of Westphalia (1648)**\n- INCORRECT. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) ended the Thirty Years' War but did NOT formally recognize Swiss neutrality. Switzerland's permanent neutrality was recognized at the Congress of Vienna in 1815.\n\n**ii. Swiss res judicata concept**\n- INCORRECT. Swiss civil procedure does NOT apply such a broad concept of res judicata. The binding effect is generally limited to the specific claim decided (claim preclusion), not all findings of fact and legal assessments for all subsequent disputes between parties.\n\n**iii. Arbitral tribunal jurisdiction decisions**\n- INCORRECT. In Swiss law, while arbitral tribunals can rule on their own jurisdiction (kompetenz-kompetenz), this decision is NOT immune from state court scrutiny. Parties can challenge jurisdictional decisions before state courts.\n\n**iv. Legal sociology methodology**\n- INCORRECT. Legal sociology is an empirical social science that observes law from an external, sociological perspective - not from the perspective of legal doctrine. The statement reverses the proper methodology.\n\n**v. Limited liability in Swiss companies**\n- CORRECT. This accurately describes the principle of limited liability in Swiss commercial law for shareholders in limited liability companies (GmbH) and corporations (AG).\n\nThe incorrect statements are: i, ii, iii, and iv\n\nLooking at the options, this corresponds to choice G.\n\n{\"answer\": \"G\", \"reasoning\": \"Statements i (Westphalia/neutrality), ii (broad res judicata), iii (unreviewable arbitral jurisdiction), and iv (legal sociology methodology) are all incorrect. Only statement v about limited liability is correct.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 552, "completion_tokens": 392, "total_tokens": 944}, "latency_s": 7.627264250011649, "request_id": "chatcmpl-731861b5-5044-4c9d-9e01-868d174f29fc", "raw_response": null}
