Specifically, it states regarding the second shirt: 'Potentially infringement, but parody defense possible' and mentions the criteria for parody under EU law (Case C-201/13, *Deckmyn*). Regarding the third shirt, it states: 'Strongest parody defense' and notes that it 'Directly comments on the original work.' This clearly satisfies the requirement that the response states that parody is a work that comments on the original work.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b07ae9a2-e64c-4687-a3c3-40377ca89fd4\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1731, "completion_tokens": 160, "total_tokens": 1891}, "latency_s": 0.9982476669829339, "request_id": "0tSUaazoFIb1kdUP8IrTsQU", "raw_response": null}
