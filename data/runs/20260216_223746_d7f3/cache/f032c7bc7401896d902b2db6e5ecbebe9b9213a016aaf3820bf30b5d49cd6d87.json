The candidate answer discusses the German reputation damages claim and lists counter-arguments, including the need for the Germans to prove 'quantifiable damages' and causation. However, it does not explicitly state that the German distributor (the claimant in arbitration) faces a *high burden of proof threshold* specifically regarding their *breach of contract* damages claim (which would be the client's counterclaim or the basis for the client's defense against termination). While it addresses damages generally, it fails to specifically address the high burden of proof threshold for the claimant's damages in the context of the breach claim, which is the focus of this criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d00808cb-d679-4896-825b-ae9319778964\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2711, "completion_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 2922}, "latency_s": 0.9118889580131508, "request_id": "PtKUaZeqEominsEP87S6kAU", "raw_response": null}
