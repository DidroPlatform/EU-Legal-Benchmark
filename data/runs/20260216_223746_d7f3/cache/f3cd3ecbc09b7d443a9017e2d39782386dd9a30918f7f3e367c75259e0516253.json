{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 1, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires the response to advise the solicitor that cases like Palmer v R and Beckford v R are not binding domestic UK precedent since they are not UK-based. The candidate answer explicitly references and discusses R v Beckford [1988] Crim LR 341, which is a UK case, and does not mention Palmer v R. Crucially, the candidate answer *does not* state that Beckford is not binding UK precedent because it is not UK-based. In fact, it treats Beckford as binding UK authority, which is correct for English law. Therefore, the candidate answer fails to meet the specific negative requirement of the rubric criterion, which demands that the response *must* state that Beckford (and Palmer) are not binding UK precedent because they are foreign cases. Since the candidate answer does the opposite (treats Beckford as binding UK authority and fails to mention Palmer v R or the required negative assertion), it satisfies the condition for a score of 1 under this rubric, as the rubric is testing whether the response makes a specific, incorrect assertion about precedent bindingness.\", \"criterion_id\": \"bbfa06d0-1d7b-41af-bb76-fa659eee9bd5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3221, "completion_tokens": 270, "total_tokens": 3491}, "latency_s": 1.3265767089906149, "request_id": "n-eUacOlFP2O28oPtf2OoQ0", "raw_response": null}
