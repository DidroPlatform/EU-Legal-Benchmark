The candidate answer explicitly addresses this in Section III.B and Section IV. Specifically, Section IV.C states: 'The jury must assess whether the force used was reasonable in the circumstances as the Defendant believed them to be — that is, in a situation where the complainant was armed and posing a lethal threat.' It further clarifies the question for the jury: 'The question for the jury is not: \\\"Was it reasonable to use broken glass against an unarmed man?\\\" but rather: \\\"Was it reasonable to use broken glass against a man the Defendant honestly believed to be armed and posing a lethal threat?\\\"' This directly covers the entitlement to consider the mistaken belief regarding the need for force (the weapon use) in the heat of the moment.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3638b3ae-0c64-4892-b3cc-fc12739096a1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4305, "completion_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 4551}, "latency_s": 0.9647790000017267, "request_id": "8UmUae_fGN_evdIPi9bMuAs", "raw_response": null}
