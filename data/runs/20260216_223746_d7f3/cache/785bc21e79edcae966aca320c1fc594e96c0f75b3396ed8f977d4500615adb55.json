The candidate answer explicitly addresses the owner's liability in relation to the deficient fire report, stating: 'The fire risk assessment you commissioned was deficient in that it failed to address electrical safety and PAT testing. While you engaged a third party, the statutory duty remained yours.' Furthermore, under Section 2.2, it details the need to demonstrate formal arrangements for cooperation and coordination (communication) with the co-occupier regarding fire safety, which directly addresses the burden of demonstrating communication and required steps to ensure compliance in a shared setting. While the premise of the criterion ('if the fire report *did* mention maintaining electrical equipment') is slightly different from the facts (the report *failed* to mention it), the response correctly identifies that the owner's liability stems from the deficient report and the failure to coordinate/monitor the shared space, placing the burden of proof on the owner to demonstrate compliance steps, which aligns with the spirit and core requirement of the criterion regarding shared responsibility and the owner's burden.\", \"criterion_id\": \"182b94af-8003-4587-b1f7-70b8f5270bf1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4454, "completion_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 4757}, "latency_s": 1.1801886660105083, "request_id": "Jb-Uac2oAemekdUPoPLrcQ", "raw_response": null}
