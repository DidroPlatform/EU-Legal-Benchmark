The candidate answer discusses the user generating a 'slightly altered' Ophelia and using it in an ad, which directly relates to the moral right against derogatory treatment or distortion. While the candidate does not explicitly cite 's.80 CDPA 1988' or use the exact term 'Right of Integrity' in the section discussing the altered character (Section 3), the entire discussion revolves around the concept of unauthorized adaptation/alteration of the character, which is the core of the Right of Integrity. However, upon closer review of the text, the candidate discusses this under 'Derivative Infringement (CDPA s.21: adaptation right)' and 'substantial similarity' tests, focusing on economic rights (s.21) rather than the specific moral right (s.80). The candidate fails to explicitly name the Right of Integrity (s.80 CDPA 1988) as requested by the criterion, even though the factual scenario described (alteration of a character) is the classic trigger for that right. Since the criterion demands identification of the *specific* right and section number, and the answer focuses on s.21 (adaptation/economic right), the criterion is not strictly met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"07e967a4-3303-4bab-a56d-961b4b8ee3fd\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2335, "completion_tokens": 331, "total_tokens": 2666}, "latency_s": 1.2421602919930592, "request_id": "XiqVaYLQDo65kdUPzNPImQM", "raw_response": null}
