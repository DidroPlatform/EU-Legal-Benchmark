The candidate answer discusses Moral Rights (Paternity/Integrity) in Section 1, noting the 'Right to be identified as the author' (paternity) and the 'Right to object to derogatory treatment' (integrity). However, the answer does not explicitly state or confirm the specific legal requirement that a breach of these rights, particularly in relation to a literary work, necessitates the copying of dialogue or plot.
