The candidate answer explicitly discusses shared liability, stating: 'As owner/RP for premises (FSO/HSWA s.4), duty to ensure common safety (e.g., inspect shared space). If lease didn't enforce PAT/FRA from lessee, or no audits, partial blame (e.g., contributory negligence in civil claims).' It further notes that the lessee is primarily to blame but assigns the owner secondary liability based on shared control and potential failure to enforce cooperation, which aligns with the concept of shared/apportioned liability in joint control situations.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e230acad-079d-4755-a895-6b8e56fa4390\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2457, "completion_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 2654}, "latency_s": 0.9025886249728501, "request_id": "kCmVabXxMsyynsEPyd_uiAQ", "raw_response": null}
