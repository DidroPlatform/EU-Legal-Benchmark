The candidate answer explicitly states that while injunctions often target assets within the jurisdiction (UK assets), 'worldwide orders are possible against foreign defendants with sufficient UK connections.' Furthermore, it discusses the inherent jurisdiction under CPR 25, which allows for worldwide freezing orders, and cites a case where a worldwide freezing order was upheld despite an arbitration clause. This directly contradicts the premise of the criterion, as the answer confirms the jurisdiction extends beyond just assets connected to England, provided there are sufficient UK connections to justify the order.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1ecca6f8-3c08-4562-8fa2-0491fea32bb3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1694, "completion_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 1866}, "latency_s": 0.716222207993269, "request_id": "giiVabjZLNqgkdUPg_fLkAM", "raw_response": null}
