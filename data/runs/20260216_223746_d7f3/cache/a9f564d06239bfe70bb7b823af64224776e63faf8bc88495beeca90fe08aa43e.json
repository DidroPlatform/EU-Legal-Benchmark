Specifically, it mentions: 1. Paying rent on time (under 'Rent Payments' evidence section and in the introduction). 2. Taking reasonable care of the property (implied by the need to counter damage claims using property condition evidence). 3. Allowing access for repairs with proper notice (implied by the need to show records of issues reported and duties under Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, which covers landlord repair duties, but the context of tenant obligations implies allowing access for those repairs). The answer also mentions complying with the tenancy agreement, which encompasses all obligations. The mention of paying rent on time is direct, and the others are strongly implied as necessary obligations to prove compliance in court.\", \"criterion_id\": \"6488c186-efa8-4d9d-84a7-e426c86d5f92\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1718, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 1932}, "latency_s": 4.701216290995944, "request_id": "LyyVaZ-uDazu7M8P7_W9-AQ", "raw_response": null}
