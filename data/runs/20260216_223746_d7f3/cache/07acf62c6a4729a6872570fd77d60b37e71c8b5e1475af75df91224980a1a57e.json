The candidate answer explicitly addresses this in Section 4, referencing case law like R v Martin and R v Beckford, which establish that an honest but mistaken belief (including the belief that a weapon was required) justifies the use of force proportionate to that perceived threat. The final assessment section confirms this by stating: 'If the Defendant can credibly demonstrate that, at the moment of the attack, he honestly believed the victim was armed and that his life was in immediate danger, the defence of self-defence is available... The crucial question will be whether a reasonable person in his shoes would have considered the use of a broken-glass weapon proportionate to the perceived threat.' This directly covers the required direction regarding mistaken belief and the use of a weapon in the heat of the moment.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3638b3ae-0c64-4892-b3cc-fc12739096a1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3248, "completion_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 3499}, "latency_s": 1.4325672499835491, "request_id": "pOeUaZTkHOf0xN8P-Yq-8AQ", "raw_response": null}
