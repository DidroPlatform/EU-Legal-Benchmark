The candidate answer details extensive documentary evidence required to demonstrate reasonable steps (Sections 1 and 2) and discusses blame (Section 3). While it mentions 'Training & Communication' (Section 1, item f) which covers staff training and drills, and 'Maintenance & Inspection Records for Fire-Safety Installations' (Section 1, item c) which covers equipment, it does not explicitly list 'fire wardens' as a required demonstration step, nor does it clearly frame these as *further* steps needed beyond what was already done (the FRA). The structure focuses heavily on documentation rather than explicitly listing the required practical steps like 'staff training, fire safety equipment and fire wardens' as separate, necessary demonstrations of reasonable steps, which is what the criterion asks for.\", \"criterion_id\": \"32ef42ed-4b18-4367-878d-ed132a875d58\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4334, "completion_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 4570}, "latency_s": 1.0909148330101743, "request_id": "vOuUabTkCuiXkdUPtIrQkAU", "raw_response": null}
