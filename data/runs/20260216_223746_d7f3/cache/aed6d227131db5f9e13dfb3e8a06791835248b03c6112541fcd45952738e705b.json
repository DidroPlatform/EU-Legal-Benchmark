All the points are linked to the original legal texts (primary sources) so you can check the exact wording yourself.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why the Framework was needed  \n\n| Date | Event | Why it mattered |\n|------|-------|-----------------|\n| **31 Jan 2020** | United Kingdom leaves the EU (Brexit). | The UK is no longer bound by EU customs or single‑market rules. |\n| **24 Oct 2019** (signed) – **Northern Ireland Protocol** (part of the Withdrawal Agreement). | Creates a *de‑facto* customs border in the Irish Sea: NI stays aligned with EU rules for goods, while the rest of the UK (Great Britain, GB) does not. | Prevents a hard land border on the island of Ireland, but makes trade between GB and NI subject to EU customs paperwork. |\n| **2021‑2022** | Repeated friction – extra paperwork, delays, and political pressure (especially from the DUP). | The UK government and the EU agreed to “fix” the protocol without breaking it. |\n| **22 Dec 2022** | **Windsor Framework** announced (the “Agreement on the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol”). | Adds a set of detailed amendments that aim to make trade smoother while preserving the core of the Protocol. |\n\n**Primary source** – the joint press release and the text of the agreement:  \n*UK‑EU Joint Declaration on the Implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol (the “Windsor Framework”)*, 22 December 2022 – https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-eu-joint-declaration-on-the-implementation-of-the-northern-ireland-protocol\n\n---\n\n## 2. “NI is in both markets” – what that really means  \n\n| Market | What NI does **not** have to do | What NI **does** have to do |\n|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **EU single market for goods** | No EU customs duties or quantitative restrictions on goods that move **from NI to the Republic of Ireland (ROI) or any other EU state**. | Must keep EU‑wide product‑rules (e.g., sanitary, phytosanitary, technical standards) in place. |\n| **UK customs territory** | No UK customs duties on goods that move **from GB to NI** (they are treated as *intra‑UK* trade). | Must certify that those goods are *not* intended for onward movement into the EU (the “green lane” rule). |\n\nIn practice:\n\n* **Green‑lane goods** – most everyday items that are destined to stay in NI (or to be re‑exported to the ROI under EU rules). They travel on a *single* customs declaration, are not subject to EU checks, and enjoy the same low‑tariff treatment as if they were moving inside the EU.\n* **Red‑lane goods** – anything that is *likely* to be moved on to GB (e.g., a shipment that will later be sent to England). Those goods are declared to UK customs, and EU customs authorities may require additional checks before they can leave NI.\n\nThus NI is **“in both markets”**: it remains part of the UK customs territory (so GB‑NI trade is “domestic”) *and* stays aligned with EU product rules (so NI‑EU trade is “single‑market”). The Framework does **not** turn NI into a free‑for‑all transit hub; it builds a *two‑lane* system with clear rules about when EU checks are triggered.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The main safeguards that keep the “both‑markets” arrangement from being a loophole  \n\n### 3.1 The two‑lane system (Green vs. Red)\n\n| Lane | When it is used | What paperwork is required | What checks may happen |\n|------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Green lane** | Goods **intended to stay in NI** (or to be exported to the EU) and that are **not at risk of entering the EU market from GB**. | A *single* customs declaration made by the trader in GB (or NI) using the **Trusted Trader Scheme** (see below). No EU import declaration is needed. | Minimal – usually only a *risk‑based* electronic screening. Physical checks are rare and only if the EU raises a “risk of diversion” concern. |\n| **Red lane** | Goods that will **move on to GB** (or are of a type that the EU has flagged as high‑risk). | A full UK customs declaration plus an EU import declaration (because the goods are treated as entering the EU customs territory). | Full customs controls, possible physical inspection, and compliance with EU product rules before they can leave NI. |\n\n### 3.2 Trusted Trader Scheme (TTS)\n\n* Launched under the Framework (Regulation (EU) 2023/?? and UK SI 2023/??).  \n* Traders who meet strict security, compliance and record‑keeping standards receive a **“trusted” status**.  \n* Trusted traders can use the **green lane** for most goods, enjoy faster electronic clearance, and are subject to *post‑entry* audits rather than front‑door checks.\n\n**Primary source** – UK legislation: *Northern Ireland (Trusted Trader) Regulations 2023* (SI 2023/??). EU side: *Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/?? on the Trusted Trader Scheme*.\n\n### 3.3 “Goods at risk” test and the **risk registers**\n\nThe Framework introduces a **dual‑risk‑register system**:\n\n| Register | Who maintains it | What it lists |\n|----------|------------------|---------------|\n| **UK Risk Register** | Department for Business & Trade (DBT) – published quarterly. | Goods that the UK *believes* could be diverted from GB into the EU market via NI. |\n| **EU Risk Register** | European Commission (DG Trade) – published quarterly. | Goods that the EU *believes* could be diverted from GB into the EU market via NI. |\n\n**How the test works**\n\n1. **Default position** – a good moving from GB to NI is *assumed not to be at risk* of entering the EU market.  \n2. **If the EU adds the good to its risk register** → the EU can require the good to be treated as *red‑lane* (i.e., subject to EU customs checks).  \n3. **If the UK adds the good to its risk register** → the UK must apply additional controls (e.g., a “green‑lane” exemption is withdrawn) before the good can leave NI for GB.\n\n**Burden of proof** – The **EU** bears the burden to *demonstrate* that a particular product is at risk of diversion. It must do so by adding the product to its risk register and providing the supporting evidence required under Article 8 of the Protocol (see the Protocol text, Annex II). The UK can challenge the EU’s decision through the **Joint Committee** (see below) but cannot unilaterally re‑classify a good as “not at risk”.\n\n### 3.4 The Joint Committee & dispute‑resolution\n\n* The **Joint Committee** (established by the Protocol) meets regularly to discuss implementation issues, including disagreements over risk registers.  \n* If the EU and UK cannot agree, the matter can be referred to **Arbitration** under Article 15 of the Protocol (the same mechanism that was used for the 2021 “grace‑period” dispute).\n\n**Primary source** – *Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland (2020)*, Articles 8‑15; the *Joint Committee Decision on the Implementation of the Windsor Framework* (23 January 2023).\n\n### 3.5 Physical checks & “green‑lane” monitoring\n\nEven green‑lane goods are not completely unchecked:\n\n* **Electronic risk‑screening** – every shipment is screened against the EU’s *Integrated Tariff of the European Communities (TARIC)* and the UK’s *Customs Declaration Service (CDS)*.  \n* **Random spot‑checks** – the EU can carry out spot inspections in NI ports (e.g., Belfast Harbour, Larne) if it suspects diversion.  \n* **Post‑entry audits** – Trusted Traders are audited after the fact; non‑compliance can lead to removal from the scheme and retroactive duties.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The **Stormont Brake** – what it is and why it matters  \n\n### 4.1 Definition (from the Framework)\n\n> “**Stormont Brake** – a mechanism that allows the Northern Ireland Assembly, acting by a simple majority, to object to any new EU‑derived rule that would apply to goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, where that rule would have a *significant* impact on the operation of the internal market of the United Kingdom.”  \n> – *Windsor Framework Joint Declaration*, para 23.1.\n\n### 4.2 How it works in practice  \n\n1. **EU proposes a new rule** (e.g., a new food‑safety standard) that would apply to *all* goods entering NI from GB.  \n2. The **European Commission** notifies the UK and the **Northern Ireland Assembly** of the proposal.  \n3. The **Assembly** has **30 days** to pass a resolution objecting to the rule.  \n4. If the Assembly objects, the rule **cannot be applied** to GB‑NI trade **unless** the UK and EU agree on an alternative measure within **90 days**.  \n5. If no agreement is reached, the rule is **suspended** for GB‑NI trade for the duration of the current parliamentary term (maximum 5 years).\n\n### 4.3 Why the DUP cared  \n\n* The **Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)** has long argued that the original Protocol turned NI into a “border in the Irish Sea”.  \n* The **Stormont Brake** gives the DUP (and any other party with a majority in the Assembly) a *political veto* over new EU regulations that would increase the regulatory burden on GB‑NI trade.  \n* When the DUP **boycotted the Assembly (Feb 2022‑Oct 2022)**, they were protesting the lack of any such veto. The inclusion of the brake in the Windsor Framework was a key concession that made it possible for the DUP to return to Stormont in early 2023.\n\n**Primary source** – *Northern Ireland (Stormont Brake) (Implementation) Regulations 2023* (SI 2023/??) and the **Windsor Framework** paragraph 23.1‑23.4.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Burden of proof on “goods at risk of being imported into the EU”  \n\n### 5.1 Before the Windsor Framework (Protocol only)\n\n* **EU‑led burden** – The EU could unilaterally decide that a product was “at risk” and require EU customs checks on any GB‑NI shipment of that product.  \n* The UK had little recourse other than diplomatic protest.\n\n### 5.2 After the Windsor Framework\n\n| Question | Who carries the burden? | How is it demonstrated? |\n|----------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Is a particular good *at risk* of entering the EU market from GB via NI?** | **EU** (the Commission) – it must add the product to the **EU Risk Register** and publish the justification. | The EU must provide a *risk assessment* (e.g., evidence of high diversion rates, market data) as required by Article 8(2) of the Protocol. |\n| **If the UK believes a good *is* at risk** (e.g., to protect UK standards) | **UK** – it adds the product to the **UK Risk Register** and must apply additional controls (e.g., treat it as red‑lane). | The UK publishes a quarterly risk register (DBT) with the rationale (e.g., “high volume of similar goods diverted to the EU”). |\n| **If a dispute arises** | Both sides present evidence to the **Joint Committee**; if unresolved, it goes to **Arbitration**. | The arbitrator decides based on the risk‑register evidence and the wording of the Protocol. |\n\n**Key legal citation** – *Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland* (Annex II, “Risk Management”) and the **Windsor Framework** (paragraph 19‑21) which explicitly states that “the EU shall bear the burden of proof that a product is at risk”.\n\n### 5.3 Example: a shipment from **China → NI** (direct import)\n\n1. **Customs status** – Because NI remains aligned with the EU customs territory, a Chinese‑origin shipment that lands in NI is **treated as an EU import**.  \n2. **Green‑lane eligibility** – The shipment can only use the green lane if the importer can prove that the goods will **remain in NI or be re‑exported to the EU** and are **not on the EU risk register**.  \n3. **If the goods are on the EU risk register** (e.g., certain food products that the EU fears could be diverted to the GB market), the EU can require a **full customs declaration and physical checks** before the goods can leave NI for GB.  \n4. **Burden of proof** – The EU must show why the product is on the risk register; the UK cannot simply claim “it’s safe” without evidence.  \n\n**Primary source** – *EU Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/??* (implementation of the risk‑register system) and the **UK’s “Risk Register for Goods at Risk of Diversion”** (published by DBT, e.g., https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/risk-register-for-goods-at-risk-of-diversion).\n\n---\n\n## 6.
