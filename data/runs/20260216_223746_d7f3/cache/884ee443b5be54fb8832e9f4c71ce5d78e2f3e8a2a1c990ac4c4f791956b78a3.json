I will address each element systematically, beginning with the legislative framework, then the duty-holder analysis, the adequacy of your steps, and finally the question of primary liability.\n\n---\n\n## 1. APPLICABLE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK\n\n### 1.1 The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (FSO/RRO)\n\nThis is the **primary legislation** governing fire safety in non-domestic premises in England and Wales. Key provisions relevant to your situation include:\n\n**Article 3 – Meaning of \"responsible person\"**\nThe responsible person is defined as:\n- **(a)** The employer, in relation to a workplace under their control\n- **(b)** The person who has control of the premises in connection with carrying on a trade, business, or undertaking\n- **(c)** The owner, where the person in control of the premises does not have control in connection with a trade, business, or undertaking\n\n**This is critical to your case.** As the building owner, you are a responsible person under Article 3. However, the neighbouring company, as a leaseholder using the premises for their trade, is **also** a responsible person. Article 5(3) explicitly states that where there is more than one responsible person, each must cooperate and coordinate with the other.\n\n**Article 5(3) and (4) – Duties of responsible persons and duty to cooperate**\nWhere multiple responsible persons share premises, they must coordinate fire safety measures. This imposes a **mutual obligation** that is directly relevant to your shared outbuilding arrangement.\n\n**Article 9 – Risk Assessment**\nEvery responsible person must carry out a suitable and sufficient fire risk assessment, focusing on identifying risks to relevant persons. This assessment must be reviewed regularly and whenever there is reason to suspect it is no longer valid.\n\n**Article 17 – Maintenance**\nThe responsible person must ensure that premises, facilities, equipment, and devices are maintained in an efficient state, in efficient working order, and in good repair. This extends to electrical installations and equipment that could constitute an ignition source.\n\n**Article 14 – Emergency routes and exits** and **Article 8 – Duty to take general fire precautions** are also engaged but are secondary to the core issues here.\n\n### 1.2 The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HSWA)\n\n**Section 2 – General duties of employers to their employees**\nRequires every employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety, and welfare at work of all employees. This includes maintaining safe systems of work and safe premises.\n\n**Section 3 – General duties of employers to persons other than employees**\nRequires every employer to conduct their undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in their employment are not exposed to risks to their health or safety. The deceased individual's status (employee of your company, employee of the neighbouring company, or a third party) will significantly affect which duty under this section is engaged and against whom.\n\n**Section 4 – General duties of persons concerned with premises**\nThis is **particularly relevant** to you as the building owner. Section 4 imposes a duty on any person who has control of non-domestic premises (or the means of access/egress, or any plant or substance in such premises) to take such measures as are reasonably practicable to ensure that the premises, access, and any plant or substance are safe and without risks to health. As the owner of the outbuilding who has leased part of it, you retain duties under Section 4 even in respect of the leased portion.\n\n**Section 7 – General duties of employees**\nEmployees themselves have a duty to take reasonable care and to cooperate with their employer on safety matters.\n\n**Section 36 and Section 37 – Offences due to fault of another person and offences by bodies corporate**\nSection 37 is particularly significant given the CPS involvement. If an offence is committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been committed with the consent, connivance, or neglect of a director, manager, secretary, or similar officer, that individual as well as the body corporate is guilty of the offence. As the factory owner, you face **personal criminal liability** under this provision.\n\n### 1.3 The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999\n\n**Regulation 3** requires a suitable and sufficient risk assessment. **Regulation 11** imposes a duty of cooperation and coordination where two or more employers share a workplace, which directly mirrors the FSO Article 5(3) obligation and reinforces the shared duty in your outbuilding scenario.\n\n### 1.4 The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989\n\n**Regulation 4** imposes a general duty to ensure that all electrical systems are constructed, maintained, and used so as to prevent danger so far as is reasonably practicable. While PAT testing is not itself a specific statutory requirement (it is a means of compliance rather than a legal obligation in its own right), the duty to maintain electrical equipment safely is absolute in terms of the obligation, qualified only by reasonable practicability. The failure to PAT test the equipment brought in by the neighbouring company represents a failure under these regulations.\n\n### 1.5 Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007\n\nGiven that a death has occurred, the CPS will be considering whether the **organisation** (your company and/or the neighbouring company) caused the death through a gross breach of a relevant duty of care, and whether the way in which the organisation's activities were managed or organised by senior management was a substantial element of that breach. This Act does not impose individual liability (it targets organisations), but it operates alongside the HSWA provisions that do target individuals.\n\n### 1.6 The Building Act 1984 and Building Regulations 2010 (Part B – Fire Safety)\n\nDepending on the age and modification history of the outbuilding, compliance with Part B of the Building Regulations may be relevant, particularly regarding fire detection, compartmentation, and means of escape.\n\n---\n\n## 2. WHAT YOU NEED TO DEMONSTRATE: REASONABLE STEPS\n\nTo demonstrate that you had taken all reasonable steps, you would need to evidence the following, with advantages and disadvantages of your current position assessed against each:\n\n### 2.1 Fire Risk Assessment (Article 9, FSO)\n\n**What you did:** Commissioned a third-party company to carry out a fire risk assessment.\n\n**Advantages:**\n- You took **proactive steps** by engaging a specialist third-party assessor, which demonstrates you took the obligation seriously\n- You **paid for professional expertise**, which shows you did not simply attempt a cursory self-assessment\n- This demonstrates awareness of your duties under Article 9 and a willingness to invest resources in compliance\n- Courts and tribunals generally view the engagement of competent external assessors favourably as evidence of a responsible approach\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- **Delegation does not absolve responsibility.** Under Article 9(1), the duty to carry out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment rests on the *responsible person*, not on any third party they engage. You cannot transfer your statutory duty by outsourcing the assessment. The case law is clear on this: *R v. Porter [2008]* and subsequent cases establish that the responsible person retains ultimate accountability\n- The fire risk assessment **failed to identify the need for PAT testing or electrical safety checks on equipment within the premises.** A \"suitable and sufficient\" assessment under Article 9 must identify all significant fire hazards, including ignition sources. Electrical equipment is one of the most common ignition sources in commercial and industrial premises, and any competent fire risk assessment should address electrical safety, including the condition and testing of portable electrical equipment\n- The omission of PAT testing from the report raises serious questions about the **competence of the assessor** you engaged. Under Article 18(7), the responsible person must appoint one or more *competent persons* to assist in undertaking preventive and protective measures. If the assessor was not competent, you may be criticised for failing to verify their competence\n- You have a **potential claim against the third-party assessor** for professional negligence (which I address below), but this does not protect you from criminal liability\n- The assessment appears not to have adequately addressed the **shared-use nature of the premises**, including risks introduced by the other occupier's equipment and activities\n\n### 2.2 Cooperation and Coordination with the Co-Occupier (Article 5(3) FSO; Regulation 11, MHSWR 1999)\n\n**What you need to demonstrate:** That you had established formal arrangements for cooperation and coordination with the neighbouring company regarding fire safety in the shared outbuilding.\n\n**Advantages (if you can demonstrate this):**\n- Evidence of formal lease terms requiring the tenant to comply with fire safety obligations, maintain their equipment, and carry out PAT testing would significantly strengthen your position\n- Evidence of regular communication, joint fire safety reviews, or shared fire safety protocols would demonstrate compliance with Article 5(3)\n- If you had written into the lease agreement specific fire safety obligations and the neighbouring company breached those terms, this shifts a degree of culpability\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- If there were **no formal arrangements** for cooperation and coordination, this represents a direct breach of Article 5(3) and Regulation 11\n- As the **building owner and lessor**, you were in the stronger position to impose conditions and requirements, and a failure to do so will be viewed critically\n- The courts will likely take the view that as the owner of the building, you had a **greater degree of control** and therefore a greater responsibility to establish the framework for shared fire safety management\n- Even if you had lease terms, you would need to demonstrate that you **monitored and enforced** compliance, not merely that the terms existed on paper\n\n### 2.3 Control of Ignition Sources and Electrical Safety (Article 17 FSO; Regulation 4, Electricity at Work Regulations 1989)\n\n**What you need to demonstrate:** That you had systems in place to ensure all electrical equipment in the outbuilding was safe, including equipment brought in by the co-occupier.\n\n**Advantages:**\n- If you can show that your own equipment was properly maintained and PAT tested, this demonstrates your general approach to electrical safety\n- If you had policies requiring PAT testing and the neighbouring company failed to comply, this helps your position\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- As the building owner, you have duties under **Section 4 of HSWA** regarding the safety of the premises, which arguably extends to ensuring that equipment used within the premises does not create risks\n- The failure to have any system for verifying the safety of equipment brought into your building by a co-occupier is a significant gap\n- The fire risk assessment's failure to address this issue means you lacked a documented basis for identifying and controlling this risk\n- **Article 17** requires maintenance of equipment and devices provided for fire safety, but the broader duty under Article 8 to take general fire precautions includes eliminating or reducing risks from dangerous substances and ignition sources\n\n### 2.4 General Fire Precautions and Emergency Planning (Articles 8, 11, 13, 14, 15 FSO)\n\n**What you need to demonstrate:** Adequate fire detection and warning systems, firefighting equipment, emergency routes and exits, emergency procedures, and training.\n\n**Advantages:**\n- If you can demonstrate that the outbuilding had appropriate fire detection (smoke/heat detectors), fire alarm systems, fire extinguishers, clear emergency exits, and that personnel had been trained, this shows a comprehensive approach\n- Evidence of fire drills, training records, and maintenance records for fire safety equipment would be strongly supportive\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- If any of these elements were absent or inadequate, each represents a separate potential breach\n- The fact that a death occurred will inevitably lead investigators to scrutinise whether adequate detection and warning systems might have prevented the fatality\n- The shared nature of the premises means you needed to ensure that the neighbouring company's employees were also covered by emergency procedures\n\n### 2.5 Record Keeping and Review (Article 9(6) and (7) FSO)\n\n**What you need to demonstrate:** That the fire risk assessment was recorded (mandatory if you employ five or more persons), kept under review, and updated when circumstances changed.\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Having a documented, professionally prepared fire risk assessment is a significant advantage over having no assessment at all\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- If the assessment was not reviewed when the neighbouring company brought in new equipment, or if there was no system for triggering reviews when circumstances changed, this is a weakness\n- The introduction of new electrical equipment by the co-occupier should have triggered a review of the risk assessment\n\n---\n\n## 3. PRIMARY LIABILITY ANALYSIS\n\nThis is the most complex question and requires careful analysis of the multiple parties involved.\n\n### 3.1 The Neighbouring Company (Co-Occupier/Leaseholder)\n\n**Strong case for significant liability:**\n\n- They introduced the equipment that caused the fire\n- They failed to ensure the equipment was electrically safe (breach of Regulation 4, Electricity at Work Regulations 1989)\n- They failed to PAT test the equipment, which, while not a standalone legal requirement, is the recognised means of demonstrating compliance with the duty to maintain portable electrical equipment safely\n- As a responsible person under Article 3 of the FSO (being in control of part of the premises in connection with their trade), they had their own independent duty to carry out a fire risk assessment and take general fire precautions\n- Under Section 3 of HSWA, they had a duty to conduct their undertaking so as not to expose others to risk\n- They are likely the **most directly culpable party** in terms of the immediate cause of the fire\n\n**Potential defences:**\n- They may argue that as tenants, they relied on the building owner (you) to establish fire safety standards and that no requirements regarding PAT testing were communicated to them\n- They may argue that the fire risk assessment (which you commissioned and which covered the shared premises) did not identify PAT testing as a requirement, and they relied on this\n\n### 3.2 Your Company (Building Owner and Co-Occupier)\n\n**Exposure to liability:**\n\n- As building owner, you have duties under **Section 4 of HSWA** that cannot be fully delegated to a tenant\n- As a responsible person under the FSO, you had a duty to cooperate and coordinate with the co-occupier (Article 5(3)) and to ensure that the fire risk assessment was suitable and sufficient (Article 9)\n- The fire risk assessment you commissioned was **deficient** in that it failed to address electrical safety and PAT testing. While you engaged a third party, the statutory duty remained yours\n- You may be found to have failed to exercise adequate oversight of the shared premises\n- Under the **Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007**, if the way your organisation's activities were managed by senior management constituted a gross breach of the duty of care owed to the deceased, your company could face prosecution\n- Under **Section 37 of HSWA**, you personally as the owner/director could face prosecution if the offence was committed with your consent, connivance, or neglect\n\n**Mitigating factors:**\n- You took the step of commissioning a professional fire risk assessment\n- The immediate cause of the fire was equipment introduced by the other party\n- You did not have direct control over the other company's equipment maintenance practices\n- You relied on professional advice that turned out to be inadequate\n\n### 3.3 The Third-Party Fire Risk Assessor\n\n**Exposure to liability:**\n\n- If they held themselves out as competent to carry out fire risk assessments and produced a report that failed to address a fundamental and foreseeable ignition source (electrical equipment), they may be liable for **professional negligence** in civil law\n- Their report should have identified electrical equipment as a potential ignition source and recommended appropriate controls, including PAT testing or equivalent electrical safety checks\n- Under **Article 18(7)** of the FSO, the responsible person must appoint competent persons. If this assessor was not competent, this reflects on both the assessor and on you for selecting them\n- You would have a potential **civil claim for contribution or indemnity** against the assessor under the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978, and potentially a standalone negligence claim\n\n**However:**\n- The assessor's failure does **not** absolve you of criminal liability. Criminal responsibility under the FSO and HSWA cannot be transferred to a third-party consultant\n- The assessor is unlikely to face criminal prosecution under the FSO directly (unless they could be considered a responsible person, which is unlikely), but their negligence is relevant to the overall picture\n\n### 3.4 The Deceased Individual\n\nThe status of the deceased is highly relevant:\n- If they were an **employee of the neighbouring company**, the neighbouring company's liability under Section 2 of HSWA is directly engaged, and your liability under Sections 3 and 4 is also engaged\n- If they were an **employee of your company**, your liability under Section 2 is directly engaged, and the neighbouring company's liability under Section 3 is engaged\n- If they were a **visitor or other third party**, both companies' duties under Section 3 are engaged, and your duty under Section 4 as building owner is engaged\n\n---\n\n## 4. CONCLUSION ON PRIMARY BLAME\n\n**The neighbouring company bears the most direct and immediate responsibility** for the fire itself, as they introduced the defective equipment that was the direct cause. Their failure to ensure electrical safety of their own equipment is a clear breach of the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 and their duties as a responsible person under the FSO.\n\n**However, you and your company carry significant secondary liability** on the following grounds:\n\n1. **As building owner**, you retained duties under Section 4 of HSWA that you did not adequately discharge\n2. **The fire risk assessment you commissioned was deficient**, and while you relied on professional advice,", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 282, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 4378}, "latency_s": 89.32038283301517, "request_id": "chatcmpl-d1f10178-7797-44c7-8734-4ec7e6d06b8c", "raw_response": null}
