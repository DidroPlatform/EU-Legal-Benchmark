{"provider": "mistral_api", "model": "mistral/mistral-large-latest", "text": "In Italy, the process of appointing a **legal guardian** (specifically under the *amministrazione di sostegno*—\"support administration\") for an elderly person who can no longer manage their affairs is governed by **Articles 404–413 of the Italian Civil Code**. This measure is designed to be **flexible and less restrictive** than full interdiction (*interdizione*) or incapacitation (*inabilitazione*), focusing on protecting the person’s rights while allowing them to retain as much autonomy as possible.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of how the court decides, the required documents, and the guardian’s responsibilities:\n\n---\n\n### **1. How the Court Decides to Grant *Amministrazione di Sostegno***\nThe court (the **Tribunale**—specifically the *Giudice Tutelare*, the guardianship judge) evaluates whether the elderly person (**beneficiario**) needs support due to:\n- **Physical or mental impairment** (e.g., dementia, Alzheimer’s, severe illness) that prevents them from managing their affairs independently.\n- **Partial incapacity** (unlike full interdiction, which requires total incapacity).\n- **Risk of harm** (e.g., financial exploitation, neglect of health/safety).\n\n#### **Key Criteria for Approval:**\n- **Medical evidence**: A **psychiatric or neurological evaluation** (often from a court-appointed expert) confirming the person’s inability to manage their affairs.\n- **Social assessment**: Reports from social workers or caregivers about the person’s daily struggles.\n- **Proportionality**: The court tailors the guardian’s powers to the person’s **specific needs** (e.g., managing finances but not medical decisions).\n- **Least restrictive measure**: The court prefers *amministrazione di sostegno* over harsher measures like interdiction unless absolutely necessary.\n\n#### **The Process:**\n1. **Petition**: Your friend (or a family member, social worker, or public prosecutor) files a request with the *Giudice Tutelare* in the elderly person’s place of residence.\n2. **Hearing**: The judge may interview the elderly person, the proposed guardian, and family members.\n3. **Expert evaluation**: A court-appointed doctor assesses the person’s capacity.\n4. **Decision**: The judge issues a **decree** (*decreto*) outlining:\n   - The **scope of the guardian’s powers** (e.g., managing bank accounts, paying bills, consenting to medical treatment).\n   - **Duration** (can be temporary or indefinite).\n   - **Obligations** (e.g., annual reporting to the court).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Required Documents**\nTo file the petition, your friend will typically need:\n#### **For the Elderly Person (*Beneficiario*):**\n- **Medical certificate** (from a neurologist, psychiatrist, or geriatrician) detailing:\n  - Diagnosis (e.g., dementia, Alzheimer’s).\n  - Degree of incapacity (e.g., \"unable to manage finances but can make personal care decisions\").\n  - Prognosis (temporary or permanent condition).\n- **Identity documents** (ID card, *codice fiscale*).\n- **Proof of residence** (e.g., *certificato di residenza*).\n\n#### **For the Proposed Guardian (*Amministratore di Sostegno*):**\n- **Criminal record certificate** (*certificato penale*) showing no convictions for crimes against property or persons.\n- **Declaration of no conflicts of interest** (e.g., not a creditor of the elderly person).\n- **Consent to act as guardian** (signed statement).\n- **Identity documents** (ID, *codice fiscale*).\n\n#### **Additional Documents:**\n- **Family consent** (if other close relatives agree, it strengthens the case).\n- **List of the elderly person’s assets** (bank accounts, property, pensions) to define the guardian’s scope.\n- **Social worker report** (if the person is in a care facility or receiving social services).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Responsibilities of the Guardian (*Amministratore di Sostegno*)**\nThe guardian’s duties are **defined by the court decree** but typically include:\n\n#### **Financial Management:**\n- **Paying bills** (utilities, rent, medical expenses).\n- **Managing bank accounts** (withdrawals, transfers, investments).\n- **Filing taxes** on behalf of the elderly person.\n- **Selling/renting property** (only if authorized by the court).\n- **Keeping detailed records** of all transactions (receipts, bank statements) for annual reporting to the court.\n\n#### **Personal Care:**\n- **Consenting to medical treatment** (if authorized by the court).\n- **Arranging care services** (home help, nursing homes).\n- **Ensuring the person’s well-being** (visits, monitoring living conditions).\n\n#### **Legal Obligations:**\n- **Annual report to the court** (*rendiconto*): A detailed account of income, expenses, and actions taken.\n- **Acting in the person’s best interest**: Decisions must prioritize the elderly person’s well-being, not the guardian’s convenience.\n- **Avoiding conflicts of interest**: The guardian cannot use the person’s assets for personal gain.\n- **Respecting the person’s autonomy**: The guardian must involve the elderly person in decisions as much as possible.\n\n#### **Limitations:**\n- The guardian **cannot** make decisions outside the court’s decree (e.g., if only authorized to manage finances, they cannot consent to surgery).\n- The elderly person retains the right to **challenge the guardian’s decisions** in court.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Duration and Termination**\n- **Temporary**: If the person’s condition improves (e.g., after recovery from an illness), the court can revoke the guardianship.\n- **Permanent**: If the incapacity is irreversible (e.g., advanced dementia), the guardianship continues until the person’s death or a court order terminates it.\n- **Termination**: The court can end the guardianship if:\n  - The elderly person regains capacity.\n  - The guardian fails to fulfill duties (e.g., mismanagement, neglect).\n  - The person dies.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Practical Tips for Your Friend**\n1. **Consult a lawyer**: While not mandatory, a lawyer specializing in *diritto di famiglia* can help navigate the process, especially if family members disagree.\n2. **Gather medical evidence early**: A detailed report from a specialist (not just a GP) strengthens the case.\n3. **Keep records**: The guardian must document all financial transactions for the court.\n4. **Involve the elderly person**: Even if they have cognitive decline, their input should be considered where possible.\n5. **Check for alternatives**: If the person only needs help with finances, a **power of attorney** (*procura*) might suffice (though it requires the person to be fully capable when signing).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Costs**\n- **Court fees**: Minimal (around €50–€200 for filing).\n- **Lawyer fees**: If hired, typically €500–€2,000 depending on complexity.\n- **Medical evaluation**: May cost €100–€300 (some public hospitals offer free assessments).\n- **Guardian’s compensation**: The court may allow a small fee (e.g., 2–5% of the person’s income) if the guardian is not a family member.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences from Other Measures**\n| **Measure**               | **Amministrazione di Sostegno** | **Interdizione** (Full Incapacitation) | **Inabilitazione** (Partial Incapacitation) |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Purpose**               | Flexible support for partial incapacity | Total incapacity (e.g., severe dementia) | Limited incapacity (e.g., spendthrifts) |\n| **Autonomy retained**     | Yes (as much as possible) | No (person is declared legally incapable) | Partial (can make some decisions) |\n| **Guardian’s powers**     | Tailored by the court | Full control over all decisions | Limited (e.g., no major financial transactions) |\n| **Reversibility**         | Yes (if condition improves) | Difficult to reverse | Possible |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Advice**\nYour friend should:\n1. **Start the process early**—delays can lead to financial or medical crises.\n2. **Ensure all documents are complete**—missing paperwork can cause delays.\n3. **Consider mediation** if family members disagree on who should be guardian.\n4. **Stay organized**—the guardian’s role requires meticulous record-keeping.\n\nFor official guidance, your friend can refer to:\n- [Italian Civil Code (Art. 404–413)](https://www.brocardi.it/codice-civile/)\n- [Ministry of Justice – Guardianship Procedures](https://www.giustizia.it/)\n\nWould you like help finding a template for the petition or a sample medical certificate?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 66, "completion_tokens": 1937, "total_tokens": 2003}, "latency_s": 31.977411749976454, "request_id": "d20f2f9625a14625957ff119f951d870", "raw_response": null}
