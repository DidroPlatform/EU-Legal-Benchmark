The candidate answer correctly states that goods arriving directly from third countries (like China) are subject to full EU customs procedures and EU-rate tariffs, as they are not covered by the Green Lane. However, it does not explicitly state that these goods must meet *all EU product safety standards* (SPS/Product rules), only that they face 'full EU customs procedures' and 'EU-rate tariffs'. While this is implied by the fact that NI applies EU single market rules for goods that may enter the single market, the specific assertion regarding *product safety standards* for direct third-country imports is not explicitly confirmed in the text, unlike the Green Lane goods which are explicitly stated to apply EU rules.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e4a1ae1b-a58e-4d31-bec4-4cf261c4a1c4\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4147, "completion_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 4371}, "latency_s": 0.9598282499937341, "request_id": "L8WUaYu8OMSzkdUP4ZaoqQU", "raw_response": null}
