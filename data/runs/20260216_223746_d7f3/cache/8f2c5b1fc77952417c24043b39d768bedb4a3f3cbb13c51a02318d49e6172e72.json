The candidate answer discusses Section 163(j) in the context of the U.S. parent's receipt of interest income, stating it limits deductibility to 30 percent of 'adjusted taxable income,' but it does not explicitly mention the transition from the current measure (EBIT) to the post-2024 measure (EBITDA) or the inclusion of depreciation and amortization add-backs relevant to the post-2024 calculation under the TCJA phase-in rules. Therefore, the specific detail required by the criterion is missing.\", \"criterion_id\": \"673e06d5-0a56-4fe3-85c5-a5b905cce4fc\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4381, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 4610}, "latency_s": 1.0207762079953682, "request_id": "o8WUafCDBLnu7M8P587SoAI", "raw_response": null}
