Expert appointment in Swiss civil proceedings**\nIn Swiss civil proceedings, parties can propose experts, but the court typically appoints experts. Parties don't generally have the right to unilaterally appoint experts for evidence purposes. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**ii. Legal sociology and legal doctrine formality**\nLegal sociology is an empirical, descriptive discipline studying law as a social phenomenon, while legal doctrine is normative and prescriptive. They follow different logical approaches - sociology uses empirical methods, not the same formal logic as legal doctrine. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**iii. Responsible Business Initiative and Swiss commercial law**\nThe Responsible Business Initiative (rejected in 2020) would have created liability for Swiss companies regarding human rights and environmental violations by subsidiaries abroad. This statement correctly describes what the initiative could have changed. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**iv. Legal sociology and incompatible theories**\nLegal sociology, as a scientific discipline, should maintain the distinction between \"is\" (descriptive) and \"ought\" (normative). Using incompatible theories that blur this distinction is not recommended methodology. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**v. Recognition of foreign judgments in Switzerland**\nSwiss law generally requires reciprocity for recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments and insolvency decrees. Without reciprocity, recognition is typically not granted. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\nIncorrect statements: i, ii, iv, and v\n\n{\"answer\": \"L\", \"reasoning\": \"Statements i, ii, iv, and v are incorrect. Statement i mischaracterizes expert appointment (courts appoint, not parties unilaterally); ii wrongly equates legal sociology's logic with legal doctrine; iv incorrectly suggests using incompatible theories without is/ought distinction; v ignores the reciprocity requirement for foreign judgment recognition in Switzerland.\"} ", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 423, "completion_tokens": 416, "total_tokens": 839}, "latency_s": 7.68676295800833, "request_id": "chatcmpl-15497fa9-ead1-4aa7-b067-8f57354a1810", "raw_response": null}
