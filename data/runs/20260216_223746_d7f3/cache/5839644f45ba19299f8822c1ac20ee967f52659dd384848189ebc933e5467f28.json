The candidate answer states: 'Under the Windsor Framework, goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are presumed to be at risk of entering the EU's single market unless they are specifically designated as not at risk.' It further addresses third-country goods: 'For goods coming from third countries (like China), they would be subject to the same rules as goods coming from Great Britain. If they are imported into Northern Ireland and are at risk of entering the EU's single market, they would be subject to checks and controls to ensure they comply with EU rules.' While the answer focuses primarily on GB to NI movements for the presumption, it correctly identifies that goods are presumed 'at risk' unless designated otherwise, which aligns with the core requirement of the criterion regarding the presumption for goods not explicitly covered by 'green lane' arrangements (which are the specific arrangements under the WF). The statement about third-country goods being subject to the same rules implies they fall under the general risk assessment framework.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2f0e047c-09d7-40ee-a04e-af21eca6630e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1298, "completion_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 1584}, "latency_s": 1.2032132919994183, "request_id": "2hGVadf-DpXIvdIP-oyG2AU", "raw_response": null}
