The candidate answer discusses the financial risks of litigation (costing £500K-£1M+ and the risk of losing entirely) and suggests taking the money as the 'Default Advice' if the client can rebuild their reputation organically. However, it never explicitly compares the potential *net* award from a successful defamation suit against the guaranteed £1.4 million, which is the core requirement of the criterion (i.e., the risk that the final award will be less than the guaranteed settlement). It focuses more on the non-financial factors and the risk of losing entirely, rather than the risk of winning less than the settlement amount.\", \"criterion_id\": \"725d5b85-42c5-4769-857e-bffae403cdcb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2576, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 2805}, "latency_s": 1.3137392500066198, "request_id": "_fmUafTzLIyD7M8PobrS-Ag", "raw_response": null}
