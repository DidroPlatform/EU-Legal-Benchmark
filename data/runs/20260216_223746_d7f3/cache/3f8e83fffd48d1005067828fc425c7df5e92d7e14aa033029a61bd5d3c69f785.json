The candidate answer strongly asserts that the user MUST inform people and obtain explicit consent because the data collected is 'special-category data' (health data). It then details the legal bases, explicitly stating that the 'Public interest in the area of public health' basis requires a legal act mandated by a public authority, and that 'Vital interests' and 'Legitimate interests' are very narrow or unlikely to apply for a simple questionnaire. This effectively communicates that the standard exceptions are unlikely to apply, making explicit consent the 'safest route,' which aligns with the criterion's requirement to state that exceptions are unlikely.\", \"criterion_id\": \"677ea83d-dbd3-4733-a995-63c750903e31\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4435, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 4651}, "latency_s": 0.9405427080346271, "request_id": "-uWUacOPPLe8xN8P6NCnoQ8", "raw_response": null}
