This is a significant period and might be relevant for establishing certain rights.\n\n2. **Adverse Possession**: In the UK, adverse possession can be established if you have been in continuous and exclusive possession of the property without the owner's consent for at least 10 years (for registered land) or 12 years (for unregistered land). However, if the landlord was aware of your presence and did not take action to remove you, this could be seen as implied permission, which might prevent adverse possession.\n\n3. **Tolerated Trespasser**: If the landlord was aware of your presence and did not take action to remove you, you might be considered a \"tolerated trespasser.\" This status can provide some protection, but it is not as strong as a formal tenancy.\n\n4. **New Owner**: The new owner has bought the property and is asking you to leave. The new owner might not be bound by any previous arrangements or tolerations by the old landlord.\n\n5. **Absence**: Your absence for a few months might be seen as interrupting the continuous occupation required for adverse possession.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is advisable to seek legal advice to understand your rights and options. You might want to gather evidence of your continuous occupation, such as utility bills, mail, or witness statements. Additionally, any documentation or communication with the previous landlord that might support your case could be helpful.\n\nIn summary, while you might have some legal protection due to your long-term occupation, the specifics of your situation and the applicable laws will determine the strength of your case. Consulting with a legal professional is recommended to get a clear understanding of your rights and the best course of action.\n\n```markdown\nI have been occupying a room (not paying rent) in a 4-bedroom flat in central London for the past 10 years; however, 6 months ago, I got the opportunity to teach abroad for a few months in Asia. I have recently been informed by my landlord that a purchaser will come to take a look at the house, and I gave them my number for any questions. A few weeks ago, the potential buyer texted me to ask if I was still living in the house, because he had noticed most of my belongings were still there, and I ignored the message. Now, the buyer has bought the house and has told me that I need to leave. Do I have legal protection in this instance?\n\n```\n\nTo determine your legal protection in this situation, consider the following points:\n\n1. **Continuous Occupation**: You have been living in the room for 10 years without paying rent.
