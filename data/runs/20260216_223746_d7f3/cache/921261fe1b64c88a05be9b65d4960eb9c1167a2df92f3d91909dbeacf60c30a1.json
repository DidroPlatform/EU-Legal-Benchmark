The candidate answer provides a 'Roles & Responsibilities Matrix' (Section VIII) which lists a 'Primary Owner' and a 'Secondary Owner', but it does not explicitly label or assign an 'Assurance Owner' for independent verification for each control point. The 'Audit Committee Liaison' column seems to indicate who reports to the AC, not necessarily the independent assurance provider (which is typically Internal Audit or an external party). Since the required roles (Accountable Owner AND Assurance Owner) are not explicitly mapped to every control point as stipulated by the criterion, the requirement is not fully met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"7114fc44-7a89-4d14-850e-1791b7474fa4\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4037, "completion_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 4242}, "latency_s": 1.3284408749896102, "request_id": "7dKUaYbvLL3ukdUPjeSHsAM", "raw_response": null}
