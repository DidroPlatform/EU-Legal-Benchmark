The response addresses goods from third countries (China) under the 'Burden of Proof' section, stating: 'From Third Countries (e.g., China to NI): ... Red lane mandatory, full EU entry summary declaration.' The red lane applies to goods destined for the EU, which necessitates meeting EU standards. Furthermore, the background section notes that the WF keeps NI aligned with 'some EU rules (e.g., goods standards)' to protect the EU single market. While the response details the green lane (UK rules) vs. red lane (full EU rules) distinction based on destination, the requirement for goods *entering* NI from third countries to meet EU standards if they are destined for the EU (the red lane) is clearly implied and covered by the explanation of the dual system protecting the EU market.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e4a1ae1b-a58e-4d31-bec4-4cf261c4a1c4\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2700, "completion_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 2946}, "latency_s": 4.130587583989836, "request_id": "JjSVaY_0Hf7MkdUP7NXHmAk", "raw_response": null}
