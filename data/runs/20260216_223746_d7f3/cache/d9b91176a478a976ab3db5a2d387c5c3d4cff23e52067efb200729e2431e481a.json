The candidate answer mentions risks related to Italian employment (high SS, visa hassle, potential PE risk) and mentions fines in the context of illegal work/visa violation (Section 3: \\\"Fines \\u20ac5k-10k if non-compliant; deportation\\\"). However, it does not explicitly mention or cite Italian Law 109/2012 regarding wrongful employment (which typically relates to undeclared work or misclassification, distinct from visa violations, although related). Since the specific legal reference and context required by the criterion are missing, the criterion is not strictly met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"57b66a40-22b0-4e57-bc5a-b69ecfb4a5ec\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2430, "completion_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 2657}, "latency_s": 0.9189108340069652, "request_id": "uyaVad2MOPDm7M8Po7vO6QU", "raw_response": null}
