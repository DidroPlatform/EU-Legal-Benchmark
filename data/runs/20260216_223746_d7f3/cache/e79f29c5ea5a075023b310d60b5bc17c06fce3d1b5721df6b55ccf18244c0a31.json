The candidate answer explicitly addresses this by stating that if the Singapore arbitration is already underway, the English court will 'defer to the tribunal' unless there are 'exceptional circumstances' (Section 1). Furthermore, in the conclusion, it states the court will 'likely refuse the injunction' if the Singapore tribunal can grant equivalent relief, thereby demonstrating the court's willingness to refuse jurisdiction based on the foreign seat/arbitration (Section 7 and Final Answer). This directly satisfies the requirement to note that the court can refuse to act based on the foreign seat.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f319b040-3157-48dd-bb9f-24ca01953844\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2800, "completion_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 2994}, "latency_s": 1.035696416045539, "request_id": "IPqUaYCWHf7MkdUPkdfHmAk", "raw_response": null}
