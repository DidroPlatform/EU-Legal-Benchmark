The candidate answer explicitly argues the opposite: that a foreign anti-arbitration injunction (which could include one from a New York court, though the prompt implies the injunction came from a court other than the enforcement court) should *not* be a standalone Article V defense and that comity yields to the strong federal policy favoring arbitration. The candidate answer argues that the seat court has primary jurisdiction and that non-seat injunctions should not control enforcement.
