The response strongly advises against a single customs entry (which would be the path requiring complex WTO/UK-EU origin substantiation under mixed-consignment rules) and details several severe negative consequences (cons) of attempting this unified approach. Specifically, it lists: 'Customs rejection,' 'VAT penalties (up to 100% of the VAT due),' 'possible anti-dumping duties,' and the high probability of a 'post-clearance audit' with associated legal fees and duties. These clearly satisfy the requirement to list cons of the complex/risky path.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b976584c-b8f2-4985-992d-3bb9247d1e3b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4583, "completion_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 4769}, "latency_s": 1.211854624969419, "request_id": "mOmUaezfD-f0xN8P-Yq-8AQ", "raw_response": null}
