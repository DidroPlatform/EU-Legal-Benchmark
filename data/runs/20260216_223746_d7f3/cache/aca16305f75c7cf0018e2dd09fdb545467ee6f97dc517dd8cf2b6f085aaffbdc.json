The candidate answer mentions the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 in Section 4.3 and Section 5, stating that unlawful eviction or harassment is a civil claim for damages and an injunction, and that regulatory action can occur for serious breaches like illegal eviction. However, it does not explicitly list two *criminal charges* the landlord could face. It focuses primarily on civil consequences (damages, costs, injunctions) and regulatory action, not specific criminal offenses under English law.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ea1a9a8b-7d7c-44c1-8ced-c217d5f70a0c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4064, "completion_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 4257}, "latency_s": 1.4136151249986142, "request_id": "tO6UabnZHO6H-8YPt6OmmQU", "raw_response": null}
