Most effective as part of comprehensive strategies including bias training, promotion equity reviews, and addressing caregiving penalties.\n\nWhat aspect interests you most—design features, international comparisons, or complementary policies?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 34, "completion_tokens": 342, "total_tokens": 376}, "latency_s": 10.07746029199916, "request_id": "chatcmpl-5a205ea8-3a5d-4d87-b2a0-d4a7aec0c57e", "raw_response": null}
