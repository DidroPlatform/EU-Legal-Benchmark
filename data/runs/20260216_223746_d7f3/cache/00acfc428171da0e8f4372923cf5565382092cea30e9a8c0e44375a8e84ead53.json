It references specific paragraph numbers and cites relevant case law (Heino and Elberte), which is consistent with typical ECHR judgment style. The complaint appears to be under Article 13 (right to an effective remedy), which is commonly examined alongside Article 8 and frequently absorbed into the Article 8 analysis. Options A and C also follow similar logic but are less polished in their formulation. Option D doesn't reach a conclusion about whether separate examination is needed, making it an incomplete continuation.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 592, "completion_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 785}, "latency_s": 5.342300375021296, "request_id": "chatcmpl-3cd085a9-5bc2-4fb5-9308-f82aedf4dd59", "raw_response": null}
