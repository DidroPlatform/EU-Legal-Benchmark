The candidate answer analyzes the *German distributor's* claim (that the US client breached by having security vulnerabilities) and develops a strategy to *defend* against that claim (e.g., arguing 'No Material Breach' under Delaware law). The response does not explicitly state that the facts presented *do not indicate* the client breached; rather, it assumes the client needs to defend against the allegation of breach made by the German firm. The analysis focuses on how to *contest* the breach allegation, not on confirming the absence of facts supporting the breach.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d5afc437-3642-4325-9116-f62d2335c899\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4285, "completion_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 4473}, "latency_s": 1.411019082996063, "request_id": "HfCUaaHwFcP2-8YP_JODwAc", "raw_response": null}
