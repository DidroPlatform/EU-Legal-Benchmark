The response states: \\\"The more significant constraint on intercompany debt, however, arises under Section 385 and the economic substance doctrines... Even if the per se rules do not technically apply, the IRS retains the ability to recharacterize debt as equity under general federal tax principles articulated in cases like Laidlaw Transportation and the multi-factor test from the case law lineage of Fin Hay Realty, examining factors such as debt-to-equity ratios, fixed maturity dates, unconditional obligations to pay, subordination, and the reasonable expectation of repayment from cash flows rather than from further equity infusions.\\\"\", \"criterion_id\": \"76d5d222-3305-4444-bc4e-537beeca267c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4340, "completion_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 4575}, "latency_s": 0.9845291250094306, "request_id": "lMWUad4f6Z6R1Q-g8utx", "raw_response": null}
