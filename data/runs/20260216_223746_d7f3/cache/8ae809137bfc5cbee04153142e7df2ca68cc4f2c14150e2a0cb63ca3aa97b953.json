The candidate answer proposes two main options: Option A (UK Subsidiary as IOR) and Option B (Fiscal Representative + Indirect Representation). Option A establishes a direct UK entity, which is not a 'Third-Party IOR' in the sense of an external service provider taking on the IOR role, but rather a captive subsidiary. The VAT mechanics discussed under Option A focus on the UK subsidiary using Postponed VAT Accounting (PVA) and charging output VAT to the retailer, which is standard for a UK established business acting as IOR. The answer does not explicitly discuss the VAT implications of using a *true* third-party IOR (where the French parent sells to the third party, who then sells to the retailer, requiring a back-to-back contract to manage VAT correctly between the three parties). While the structure proposed (Option A) correctly handles VAT for a subsidiary IOR, it fails to address the specific requirement related to the VAT implications of a *Third-Party IOR* solution, which typically involves a specific back-to-back contract structure to prevent double VAT charges or incorrect liability assignment when the original exporter (French parent) is selling through an intermediary IOR to the final buyer.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2941285f-f638-4e87-9944-0cebd24bc52b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4370, "completion_tokens": 329, "total_tokens": 4699}, "latency_s": 1.4284997500071768, "request_id": "UMuUacbZDLGqnsEPso7fsQU", "raw_response": null}
