The response discusses the foreign tax credit limitation specifically in the context of GILTI, stating: \\\"Instead, the foreign tax credit is limited to the U.S. tax on GILTI, which is calculated at the reduced rate of 21% (or the applicable U.S. rate) minus the DTIR deduction. This limitation can result in excess foreign tax credits that cannot be used to offset U.S. tax on GILTI, effectively increasing the U.S. tax burden on the acquisition.\\\" While this describes the *effect* of the limitation (i.e., excess credits cannot offset other income), it does not explicitly state the general *purpose* of the FTC limitation as described in the criterion (i.e., segregating foreign income baskets to prevent cross-crediting between different types of income). Therefore, the criterion is not clearly satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9620eeef-a685-4f67-8c7e-caaed3794617\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3298, "completion_tokens": 262, "total_tokens": 3560}, "latency_s": 0.8934097500168718, "request_id": "kOOUabvYC4bvxN8P8LLRkA8", "raw_response": null}
