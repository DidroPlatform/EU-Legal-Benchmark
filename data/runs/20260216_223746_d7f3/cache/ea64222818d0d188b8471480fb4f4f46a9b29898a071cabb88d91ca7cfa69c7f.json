The candidate answer does not make this claim. Instead, it correctly implies that the court determines the scope of the guardian's role by stating the court evaluates the parent's condition and the guardian's ability, and the responsibilities listed are general (managing finances, ensuring well-being, acting in the best interest), which aligns with the tailored nature of 'amministrazione di sostegno' where the judge specifies the necessary support measures.
