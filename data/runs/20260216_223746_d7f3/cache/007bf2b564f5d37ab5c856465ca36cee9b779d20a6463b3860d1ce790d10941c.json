It does not discuss the possibility of shared liability or apportionment of fault, which is a concept primarily relevant in civil negligence claims, but the criterion specifically asks for this possibility within the context of the analysis.\", \"criterion_id\": \"dda864ac-b922-4cbc-89f6-414a89bd03ed\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1716, "completion_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 1899}, "latency_s": 0.8716182089992799, "request_id": "YjGVaaqXDNqfnsEPvPyNyAM", "raw_response": null}
