The candidate answer does not focus on identifying specific breaches or warranties. Instead, it analyzes the *grounds for termination* under Delaware law (material breach, notice/cure, implied covenant of good faith) and develops a *strategy* around proving the termination was pretextual. It discusses the need to analyze specific warranties but never limits the potential breaches to the two specified in the criterion. Therefore, the criterion is not satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1bce5a9e-0f4a-4efc-907a-29da83e99438\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4225, "completion_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 4410}, "latency_s": 0.8896483749849722, "request_id": "IsOUaYj3E7iMkdUP6OakcA", "raw_response": null}
