{"provider": "nim", "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", "text": " Buying property in Italy involves a unique legal framework and potential pitfalls that differ significantly from Anglo-Saxon or other systems. Before signing the **compromesso** (preliminary contract), you need to treat this as a due diligence phase, not just a formality. Here is what you must verify:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Legal Checks (Do These *Before* Signing)\n**Hire a commercialista or lawyer** to review these, even if the notary will eventually handle the deed. Do not rely solely on the real estate agent.\n\n*   **Title & Encumbrances (Visura Ipotecaria):** Obtain a fresh *visura ipotecaria* (within 15 days of signing). Check for:\n    *   **Ipoteche (Mortgages):** Must be cleared before or at the final deed (*rogito*).\n    *   **Pignoramenti (Seizures/Foreclosures):** If the seller has creditors, the house could be seized.\n    *   **Vincoli (Liens):** Such as *diritto di abitazione* (usufruct) for an ex-spouse or elderly relative.\n    *   **Successione issues:** If the seller inherited the property, ensure all heirs have signed off and inheritance taxes (*imposta di successione*) were paid.\n\n*   **Urban Planning Compliance (Conformità Urbanistica/Edilizia):** This is the biggest risk for foreign buyers.\n    *   **Abusivismo Edilizio:** Any structural changes (even a converted attic or added bathroom) without a *Permesso di Costruire*, *DIA*, *SCIA*, or *CILA* are illegal. You could be forced to demolish them or unable to get utilities connected.\n    *   **Agibilità vs. Abitabilità:** Verify the *certificato di agibilità* (habitability certificate) exists, especially for rural buildings (*case rurali*) converted to residential use.\n    *   **Catasto Alignment:** Ensure the floor plans at the *Catasto* (land registry) match reality. Mismatches mean future capital gains (*plusvalenza*) issues and tax penalties.\n\n*   **Preemption Rights (Diritto di Prelazione):**\n    *   If buying agricultural land (*terreno agricolo*), tenants or neighbors may have first right of refusal.\n    *   Historical/artistic properties may require Ministry approval (*Nulla Osta*).\n\n*   **Condominium Debts (Spese Condominiali):** If buying an apartment, request a *certificato di regolarità condominiale*. Unpaid debts pass to the buyer pro-rata from the date of sale. Check for ongoing litigation (*atti in giudizio*).\n\n---\n\n### 2. The \"Hidden\" Costs (Budget 10-15% Extra)\nMany buyers calculate only the purchase price. Here is the reality:\n\n| Cost | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Taxes** | • **Resident/Prima Casa:** ~2% of *rendita catastale* (registration) + fixed fees (~€300-500).<br>• **Non-Resident/Second Home:** ~9% of *rendita catastale* (or purchase price if higher) + ~€600-1,000 fixed.<br>• **New Build (from developer):** 4% VAT (prima casa) or 10% VAT (seconda casa). |\n| **Notary (Notaio)** | €1,500–€4,000+ depending on complexity and property value. You pay this at the *rogito*, but discuss fees upfront. |\n| **Agency Fees** | **3-5% + VAT (22%)** each from buyer and seller, often payable at the **compromesso**, not at closing. This is negotiable but culturally expected. |\n| **Technical Due Diligence** | Geometra/surveyor (€500–€1,500) to check structural integrity, boundary lines, and seismic compliance (Zone 1-3). |\n| **Bank/Mortgage Fees** | Appraisal (*perizia*), tax on mortgage (0.25% or 2% of loan amount), and mutuo setup fees. |\n| **IMU Adjustment** | Property tax is paid in advance; you'll reimburse the seller for the portion of the year post-sale. |\n| **Utilities** | Connection fees if the house has been uninhabited (*voltura* costs). |\n\n---\n\n### 3. The Compromesso Itself: Critical Clauses\nThe *compromesso* is legally binding. Breaking it has consequences.\n\n*   **Deposit (Caparra):** \n    *   **Caparra Confirmatoria:** Standard. If you back out, you lose it; if the seller backs out, they pay double.\n    *   **Caparra Penitenziale:** Rare. Either party can walk away by paying the agreed penalty.\n    *   *Amount:* Typically 10-20% of price. Do not pay this to the agent; use a bank check (*assegno circolare*) or escrow.\n\n*   **Suspensive Conditions (Condizioni Sospensive):** Essential protections:\n    *   *\"Subordinato all'ottenimento del mutuo\"* (Subject to mortgage approval) – specify the interest rate cap and deadline.\n    *   *\"Subordinato alla verifica della conformità urbanistica\"* (Subject to planning compliance verification).\n    *   *\"Subordinato alla liberazione da ipoteche\"* (Subject to mortgage clearance).\n\n*   **Timeline:** Set a realistic date for the *rogito* (final deed). Delays incur penalties.\n\n*   **Penalty for Delay:** Clarify who pays if the seller hasn't vacated by the *rogito* date.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Special Red Flags\n*   **\"Prima Casa\" Benefits:** To get the reduced 2% tax rate, you must move residency (*residenza*) to the comune within 18 months. If you don't, you owe the difference plus a 30% penalty.\n*   **Rural Buildings (*Fabbricati Rurali*):** Often lack *agibilità* or have *concessione edilizia* issues. Cannot be sold as \"luxury villas\" without proper conversion.\n*   **Historical Centers:** Check for *vincoli storico-artistici* (heritage restrictions) that limit renovations.\n*   **\"Rent to Buy\" (*Affitto con Riscatto*):** Complex and risky; ensure the contract is registered and the future sale price is fixed against inflation.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Your Action Checklist\n**Before you sign anything:**\n1.  Visit the *Catasto* office with the seller's *codice fiscale* to compare plans with reality.\n2.  Hire a *geometra* to inspect the property (not just a surveyor from your home country).\n3.  Request the seller's *visura ipotecaria* and *visura catastale* (or have your notary request it).\n4.  Verify the seller actually owns the property (*proprietà*) and is of sound legal mind.\n5.  Check condominium minutes (*verbali assemblee*) for the last 2 years if applicable.\n6.  Ensure your *codice fiscale* (Italian tax ID) is ready.\n\n**Final Advice:** The Italian notary (*notaio*) is a public official who ensures the deed is valid, but they are **neutral**, not your lawyer. If your Italian is imperfect or the property has any complexity (old, rural, inherited), hire an independent *avvocato* (lawyer) to review the *compromesso* before you sign. The few thousand euros spent now save tens of thousands later.\n\nDo you have a specific type of property in mind (city apartment, countryside villa, or rustic farmhouse)?
