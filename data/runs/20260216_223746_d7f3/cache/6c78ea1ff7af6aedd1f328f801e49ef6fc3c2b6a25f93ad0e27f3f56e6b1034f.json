While it does not explicitly name 'Article 42 of the ICSID Convention,' the discussion of incorporating domestic law into the treaty framework to provide a substantive basis for the state's claim (which is the core concept behind using Article 42 or analogous custom in ICSID cases) is clearly present and central to the analysis of the applicable law for state counterclaims.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b21bb6a4-a9dd-4787-83a9-afdb78d12f8e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3274, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 3488}, "latency_s": 1.0847552920458838, "request_id": "9u2UafmRC_fonsEPuaungAQ", "raw_response": null}
