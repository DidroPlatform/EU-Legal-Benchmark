The candidate response lists several critical provisions (Veto Rights, Tag-Along, Drag-Along, Information Rights, Exit Rights) but fails to explicitly state or advise that provisions affecting share rights (like veto rights or transfer restrictions, which are often key minority protections) must be formalized in the *Satzung* (Articles of Association) to be fully enforceable against the company or third parties, as opposed to just being contractual obligations in the SHA. The justification provided focuses on market practice and general consistency with German law flexibility, not the specific requirement for inclusion in the *Satzung* for enforceability of share rights.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f462ad42-2453-401c-bc17-67772f6a802f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1070, "completion_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 1295}, "latency_s": 1.1511462919879705, "request_id": "YAyVacnJAbaIvdIPwq3e4Qo", "raw_response": null}
