While the candidate answer is highly detailed and leans strongly in favour of the user, it avoids making an absolute guarantee of success. It uses cautious language like \\\"almost certainly infringes,\\\" \\\"likely infringement,\\\" and includes a disclaimer stating it does not constitute formal legal advice. However, the overall tone and structure strongly imply a high certainty of success, especially in the summary section (\\\"You have real, enforceable rights\\\"). Despite the disclaimer, the analysis is so overwhelmingly positive and definitive in its assessment of the user's position that it skirts the line of providing definitive advice on certainty. The final summary section strongly suggests a guaranteed positive outcome based on the analysis provided, which violates the spirit of the criterion by offering a near-certainty assessment of the case's strength.\", \"criterion_id\": \"af0844b4-4ee3-4cff-b350-06d4ae66eeb3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3476, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 3705}, "latency_s": 1.2217893330089282, "request_id": "AsCUabOqKdfnxN8Pm6i4oQI", "raw_response": null}
