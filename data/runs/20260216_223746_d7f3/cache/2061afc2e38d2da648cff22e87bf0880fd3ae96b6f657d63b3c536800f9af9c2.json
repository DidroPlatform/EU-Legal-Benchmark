{"provider": "bedrock", "model": "bedrock/converse/openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0", "text": "Below is a **“lean‑but‑tough”** roadmap for the Shareholders’ Agreement (SHA) that focuses on the handful of clauses that give you the strongest protection as a 25 % minority investor while keeping the document short enough not to scare the founders.  I’ve grouped the provisions into three buckets – **(A) Core minority‑protective rights, (B) Exit‑enabling rights, (C) Governance & “deal‑breaker” rights** – and then explain **why each is critical, how it is usually drafted under German law, and how you can frame the ask so that the founders see it as a value‑add rather than a restriction**.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What the founders already have under German law (so you don’t ask for the same thing twice)\n\n| Statutory rule | What it already gives the minority shareholder | Why you can reference it in the negotiation |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **§ 15 GmbHG – Pre‑emptive rights on new capital contributions** | Any existing shareholder has a statutory right to subscribe to new shares in proportion to his current shareholding (unless the shareholders expressly waive it). | You can say “we will rely on the statutory pre‑emptive right, but we want it spelled out in the SHA for certainty and to define the waiver‑procedure for future rounds.” |\n| **§ 51a GmbHG – Inspection rights** | Shareholders may inspect the books, minutes, and accounting records. | Use this as a baseline for a more detailed “information rights” schedule (quarterly financials, KPI dashboards, etc.). |\n| **§ 46 GmbHG – Right to call a shareholders’ meeting** | Any shareholder owning at least 5 % of the share capital may convene a meeting. | Good to remind founders that you already have a procedural lever; the SHA can simply tighten the notice periods and agenda items. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  The **critical, high‑impact provisions** you should keep in the SHA\n\n### A.  Minority‑Protective Rights (the “safety net”)\n\n| # | Provision | Why it matters for a 25 % stake | Typical German‑market wording (concise) | How to justify it to founders |\n|---|-----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **A1** | **Information & Reporting Rights** (quarterly P&L, balance sheet, cap‑table, KPI dashboard, and a copy of the annual accounts within 30 days of filing). | Gives you early warning of cash‑burn, dilution, or strategic drift. | “The Company shall deliver to the Investor within 30 days after the end of each fiscal quarter: (i) unaudited financial statements, (ii) a KPI report, (iii) an updated cap‑table, and (iv) any material contracts entered into during the quarter.” | Position it as “transparent governance that helps all shareholders understand the business and plan follow‑on financing together.” |\n| **A2** | **Statutory Pre‑emptive Rights – Confirmation & Waiver Procedure** | Guarantees you can maintain your 25 % (or a higher % if you choose) in future rounds. | “Any issuance of Shares shall be subject to the pre‑emptive rights of existing shareholders under § 15 GmbHG. The Company shall provide the Investor with a notice of the proposed issuance, the price, and the terms at least 14 days before the shareholders’ meeting. The Investor may waive its right in writing within 7 days.” | Emphasise that this is **standard practice** for any VC round in Germany; it protects the founders from unwanted “founder‑dilution” by third parties as well. |\n| **A3** | **Tag‑along (Co‑sale) Rights** – “If any shareholder (including founders) sells > 10 % of the Company, the Investor may elect to sell its shares on the same terms.” | Prevents you from being left behind in a partial exit that could de‑value the remaining shares. | “In the event that one or more Shareholders (the “Selling Shareholders”) propose to transfer Shares to a third party (the “Transferee”) constituting more than 10 % of the share capital, the Investor shall have the right, exercisable within 10 business days of receipt of the notice, to sell all (or a pro‑rata portion of) its Shares on the same price and terms.” | Explain that tag‑along is **the norm** in German VC deals and actually protects founders because it forces any buyer to purchase the whole cap‑table, avoiding a “minority‑drag‑down” scenario. |\n| **A4** | **Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on Founder Transfers** | Gives you a first shot at any founder‑initiated sale, limiting the risk of a “strategic outsider” gaining a foothold. | “Before any Founder may transfer Shares to a third party, the Investor shall have a right of first refusal to purchase such Shares on the same terms, exercisable within 10 business days of receipt of the transfer notice.” | Frame it as “protecting the company’s strategic continuity – we all want to keep the founding team aligned, and a ROFR simply gives us a chance to step in if a founder wants to cash out early.” |\n| **A5** | **Founder Vesting / Reverse Vesting** (e.g., 4‑year vesting with 1‑year cliff on the existing founder shares). | Aligns founders’ incentives with the long‑term exit horizon and prevents a founder from walking away with a large block of shares after the round. | “Each Founder shall be subject to a reverse‑vesting schedule of 4 years (25 % per year) on the Shares held at Closing. In the event of a Founder’s termination for cause, any unvested Shares shall be repurchased by the Company at fair market value.” | Stress that reverse‑vesting is **industry‑standard** for early‑stage German startups and is already built into most term‑sheets; it simply formalises an informal expectation that founders stay for the next 3‑4 years. |\n\n### B.  Exit‑Enabling Rights (the “exit engine”)\n\n| # | Provision | Why it matters for a 25 % minority | Typical German‑market wording | Founder‑friendly justification |\n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **B1** | **Drag‑along (Compulsory Sale) Rights** – limited to “qualified sale” (≥ 50 % of the share capital) and with a **minimum price floor** (e.g., 3‑year‑average of the last financing round). | Guarantees you can exit if a strategic buyer wants the whole company; the price floor protects you from being forced into a low‑ball deal. | “If Shareholders holding at least 50 % of the share capital (the “Majority Shareholders”) approve a Sale Transaction (sale of > 50 % of the Company), the Investor shall be obligated to sell its Shares on the same terms, provided that the purchase price per Share is not less than the higher of (i) the price paid in the most recent financing round, or (ii) the average price of the last three financing rounds multiplied by 0.85.” | Explain that drag‑along is **the only realistic way** to achieve a clean exit in Germany (where minority dissent can block a sale). The price‑floor clause is a **fair compromise** that protects both parties. |\n| **B2** | **Registration / “Put” Rights** – Investor may require the Company to register its Shares for a public offering or to sell its Shares back to the Company after a 5‑year lock‑up. | Gives you a fallback exit if a strategic sale never materialises. | “After the fifth anniversary of the Closing, the Investor may request that the Company repurchase up to 25 % of its Shares at the fair market value determined by an independent valuation (or at the price of the most recent financing round, whichever is higher).” | Position as “a safety‑net for both sides – if the market doesn’t present a buyer, we can still unwind the investment without harming the company’s cash flow.” |\n| **B3** | **Right to Participate in Future Rounds (Pro‑Rata Participation)** – essentially a reiteration of the statutory pre‑emptive right but with a **clear procedural timetable**. | Guarantees you can keep your ownership percentage (or increase it) in Series B, C, etc. | “For any future capital increase, the Investor shall be entitled to subscribe for Shares on a pro‑rata basis, calculated on the basis of its shareholding immediately prior to the increase, on the same terms as offered to the new investors.” | Reinforce that this is **standard** and protects the company from “over‑dilution” of existing shareholders, which is in the founders’ interest as well. |\n\n### C.  Governance & Deal‑Breaker Rights (the “control levers”)\n\n| # | Provision | Why it matters for a minority | Typical German‑market wording | Founder‑friendly spin |\n|---|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **C1** | **Board / Observer Seat** – Investor gets one board observer (or a full board seat if the company adopts a supervisory board). | Gives you a voice in strategic decisions without creating a formal veto that could stall the founders. | “The Investor shall be entitled to appoint one observer to attend all meetings of the Management Board and receive all board materials. The observer shall have no voting rights but may ask questions and request clarification.” | Emphasise that an observer helps the investor add value (network, follow‑on funding) and does **not** interfere with day‑to‑day management. |\n| **C2** | **Veto Rights on “Key Decisions”** – limited to a short, well‑defined list (e.g., amendment of articles, issuance of senior debt > €1 m, change of business line, sale of > 30 % of assets). | Provides a “minority protection” against actions that could materially affect your exit value. | “Without the prior written consent of the Investor, the Company shall not (i) amend its Articles of Association in a way that changes the voting rights attached to any class of shares, (ii) incur senior indebtedness exceeding €1 million, (iii) sell, lease or otherwise dispose of assets representing more than 30 % of the Company’s total assets, or (iv) change the Company’s core business.” | Explain that these vetoes are **narrow** and protect the company from “big‑ticket” decisions that could jeopardise the round’s valuation. |\n| **C3** | **Deadlock‑Resolution Mechanism** – e.g., “Russian‑Roulette” or “Buy‑Sell” clause triggered after a 30‑day impasse on a key decision. | Prevents a stalemate that could paralyse the company (especially important when the founders hold 60 %). | “If the Shareholders cannot reach agreement on a Key Decision within 30 days after the decision is first proposed, either party may trigger a buy‑sell mechanism whereby the initiating party offers to sell its Shares to the other at a price determined by an independent expert.” | Stress that a deadlock clause is **protective for everyone** – it forces a resolution rather than letting the company languish. |\n| **C4** | **Confidentiality & Non‑Compete** – limited to the business area and a 12‑month period post‑departure. | Standard, but worth spelling out to avoid future disputes. | “Each Founder and key employee shall not, for a period of twelve (12) months after termination, engage in any business that competes directly with the Company within Germany and the EU.” | Mention that this is **industry‑standard** and helps protect the IP and market position the founders have built. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  How to **keep the SHA lean** while covering the above\n\n1. **Use a “Schedule‑Based” approach** – put the detailed lists (e.g., KPI definitions, notice periods, list of “Key Decisions”) in annexes that can be updated by mutual written agreement.  \n2. **Combine related clauses** – e.g., merge “Tag‑along” and “ROFR” into a single “Transfer Rights” section with sub‑paragraphs.  \n3. **Avoid over‑specifying valuation methods** – use “fair market value as determined by an independent valuation firm (e.g., PwC, EY) selected by mutual agreement.”  \n4. **Limit the number of vetoes** – stick to the four‑point list in C2; any additional vetoes can be added later if the company raises a larger round.  \n5. **Use plain‑English/ German bilingual headings** – makes the document easier to read for founders who are not legal experts.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  **Pitch script** – how to present each ask to the founders\n\n| Clause | Founder‑focused benefit | Quick line you can say |\n|--------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Information & Reporting** | Gives founders a “dashboard” they can also use for future investors and banks. | “We’ll get quarterly numbers – that’s the same data you already prepare for your bank, just formalised so we’re all on the same page.” |\n| **Pre‑emptive Rights** | Protects founders from being diluted by a third‑party that could come in at a lower price. | “If we all keep our pro‑rata rights, nobody gets surprised by a later round that shrinks anyone’s slice.” |\n| **Tag‑along / ROFR** | Guarantees any buyer will have to take the whole team, which usually yields a higher price. | “Tag‑along means a buyer can’t cherry‑pick just the founders – they have to buy the whole company, which is better for everyone.” |\n| **Founder Vesting** | Aligns the team for the next 3‑4 years and is a signal to later investors that the founders are still “in it.” | “Reverse‑vesting is just a formal way to show the market that you’re committed for the next growth phase – it’s expected by most VCs.” |\n| **Drag‑along with price floor** | Enables a clean exit without a minority hold‑out that could block a strategic sale. | “The drag‑along only kicks in for a qualified sale, and we’ve built in a price floor so you’re never forced into a low‑ball deal.” |\n| **Board observer** | Gives you the ability to add value (network, follow‑on funding) without taking day‑to‑day control. | “Our observer will be a sounding board, not a decision‑maker – think of it as an extra set of eyes that can open doors for you.” |\n| **Veto on big‑ticket items** | Protects the company from taking on debt or selling assets that could jeopardise the business you built. | “We only ask for vetoes on truly material moves – things that could change the company’s risk profile dramatically.” |\n| **Deadlock clause** | Provides a clear, fair way out if the founders and investors ever disagree on a strategic pivot. | “A buy‑sell clause is a safety valve for both sides – it forces a resolution rather than leaving the company stuck.” |\n\n**Key framing points:**\n\n* **“Standard in German VC deals”** – cite recent German Series A term‑sheets (e.g., from German VC Association (VCDE) 2023‑24) that include the same clauses.  \n* **“Protects the founders as much as the investor”** – each right is paired with a founder‑friendly counterpart (e.g., price floor on drag‑along, limited veto list).  \n* **“Facilitates future fundraising”** – investors and banks look for clear, enforceable shareholder agreements; a clean SHA makes the next round smoother.  \n* **“Aligns incentives”** – vesting, information rights, and board observer all push the company toward a higher exit valuation, which is the founders’ ultimate goal.  \n\n---\n\n## 5.
