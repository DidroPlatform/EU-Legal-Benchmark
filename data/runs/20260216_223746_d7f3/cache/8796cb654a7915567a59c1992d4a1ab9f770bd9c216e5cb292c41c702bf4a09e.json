The lower the statutory burden, the higher the net salary you can offer or the lower the cash out‑lay. | Effective marginal tax rate on the gross salary (employer side). |\n| **Avoid double‑taxation / compliance gaps** | The employee will be tax‑resident in one country, the employer may be in another.  The group must respect the Italy‑UK Double Tax Treaty (DTT) and the EU‑UK Trade & Cooperation Agreement (TCA). | No un‑reclaimed withholding, no exposure to penalties, correct reporting on Form 730/770 (Italy) and P45/P60 (UK). |\n| **Maintain a “managerial” status** (i.e. a senior, decision‑making role) | In many jurisdictions a “manager” can be treated as a *key employee* or *executive* and may trigger additional reporting (e.g., Italian “dirigente” regime, UK “off‑payroll” (IR35) rules). | Whether the contract is classified as *dirigente* (Italy) or *executive* (UK) and the related statutory obligations. |\n| **Legal right to work in Italy** | Post‑Brexit, UK nationals are no longer EU free‑movers.  A work‑permit (or equivalent) is required unless the employee already holds an Italian/EU passport or a residence permit. | Visa / permit type (e.g., **“Lavoro subordinato”** or **“Blue Card”**). |\n\nBelow you will find a **step‑by‑step comparison** of the two main structures you can use, the **tax and social‑security consequences**, the **managerial‑status implications**, and the **immigration requirements** if the employee works in Italy.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Two possible structures\n\n| # | Structure | Where the employee is *contractually* employed | Where the salary is *paid* | Where the employee physically works | Typical legal vehicle |\n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **A** | **Direct Italian employment** (parent company) | Italy (Italian *Società per Azioni* or *SRL*) | Italy (Italian payroll) | Italy (office, remote, etc.) | *Contratto di lavoro subordinato* – can be *tempo indeterminato* or *determinato*; optionally *dirigente* (executive) |\n| **B** | **UK‑subsidiary employment** (seconded/posted) | United Kingdom (UK Ltd.) | UK (PAYE) – then *cost‑reimbursement* to Italy | Italy (working location) | *Employment contract* under UK law; secondment/posting arrangement with the Italian parent |\n\nBoth structures can be made to work, but the **tax‑efficiency** and **administrative burden** differ dramatically.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Tax & Social‑Security Impact – Employer Side  \n\n### 3.1 Option A – Direct Italian employment  \n\n| Item | What you pay in Italy | How it is calculated | Approx. rate (2024) | Comments |\n|------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------|\n| **Employer‑social‑security (INPS)** | *Contributi a carico del datore di lavoro* | 33 % of gross salary (general regime) – reduced to 30 % for “art. 13” (young workers) or 27 % for “art. 14” (small firms) – plus *addizionali* (regional & municipal) | 30‑33 % (plus 0.5‑2 % local) | If the employee is classified as **dirigente**, the contribution base is capped at € 101 427 (2024) and the rate is 24 % (plus 0.5‑2 % addizionali). |\n| **Employer‑unemployment (Cassa Integrazione)** | Not mandatory for *dirigenti*; optional for other staff | – | – | *Dirigenti* are exempt from many “Cassa Integrazione” rules. |\n| **Work‑related insurance (INAIL)** | 0.5‑1 % of gross (depends on risk class) | – | ~0.5 % | Mandatory for all employees. |\n| **Corporate‑tax deductibility** | Salary + contributions are fully deductible | – | – | Reduces Italian corporate tax (IRES 24 % + IRAP 3.9 % in most regions). |\n| **Withholding tax (IRPEF)** | Employer must withhold and remit to *Agenzia delle Entrate* | Progressive rates 23‑43 % (based on employee’s total taxable income) | – | Not a cost to the employer, but a compliance step. |\n| **Reporting** | *CU* (Certificazione Unica), *Modello 770*, *INPS* quarterly filings | – | – | Must be filed in Italian language, electronic via *Entratel* or *Fisconline*. |\n\n**Key take‑away:**  \n- The **gross‑to‑net cost** for the employer is roughly **+30‑35 %** on top of the agreed gross salary (higher if the employee is not a *dirigente*).  \n- The **deductibility** of the whole amount is straightforward.  \n- No cross‑border social‑security coordination is needed – the employee will be covered by the Italian system (INPS).  \n\n---\n\n### 3.2 Option B – UK‑subsidiary employment (seconded to Italy)\n\n| Item | What you pay in the UK | What you pay in Italy (if any) | How it is calculated | Approx. rate (2024) | Comments |\n|------|------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------|\n| **UK PAYE & National Insurance (NI)** | Income‑tax (PAYE) + Employer NI (Class 1) | – | PAYE on gross salary (20‑45 % bands) + 13.8 % NI on earnings > £ 9 568 | 13.8 % NI + tax | Employer NI is **non‑recoverable** for the group (cannot be deducted in the UK corporation tax return). |\n| **UK employer NI** | 13.8 % on gross (no ceiling) | – | – | – | This is a **real cost** that stays in the UK. |\n| **Italian social‑security (INPS)** | **None** if the employee obtains an **A1 certificate** (see below) | **None** (A1 certifies coverage under UK scheme) | – | – | If the employee is *posted* for ≤ 24 months, the UK can remain the “home” system. |\n| **Italian “posting” contributions** | – | **Employer‑social‑security “posting” surcharge** (if the employee is *posted* under the EU‑UK TCA) | 0 % (no contribution) – but a **“posting” declaration** must be filed with INPS within 7 days of start. | – | No INPS contributions are due, but you must register the posting (Form *Modello 770* “Dichiarazione di lavoro in trasferta”). |\n| **Corporate‑tax deductibility** | Salary + UK NI are deductible in the UK subsidiary (corporate tax 19 % → 25 % from 2024) | The cost is *reimbursed* to the parent – the parent can deduct the reimbursement as a **service‑fee expense** (subject to arm’s‑length pricing). | – | – | The group must respect **transfer‑pricing** (OECD Article 9) – the fee must be at “arm’s‑length”. |\n| **Withholding tax on the reimbursement** | – | Potential **Italian withholding tax (30 %)** on the service fee if the UK subsidiary is not a “permanent establishment” (PE) in Italy. | – | – | Usually avoided if the UK entity is considered a **non‑resident** for Italian tax purposes and the service fee is covered by a **double‑taxation treaty** (Italy‑UK DTT, Art. 12 – Business profits). |\n| **Reporting** | PAYE & NI filings (RTI), P45/P60, annual employer return (CT600) | Posting declaration to INPS, quarterly “Modello 770” for any Italian‑source income, possible “Modello Unico” for the UK subsidiary if it has an Italian PE. | – | – | Complex – you need a **tax adviser** in both jurisdictions. |\n\n#### 3.2.1 Posting vs. Secondment  \n\n| Concept | Duration | Social‑security | Tax residence | Administrative steps |\n|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|\n| **Posting (EU‑UK TCA)** | Up to **24 months** (extendable to 36 months in some cases) | **A1 certificate** – employee stays under UK NI/ pension | Remains UK tax‑resident (unless he spends > 183 days in Italy) | Register posting with **INPS** (Form *Modello 770* “Dichiarazione di lavoro in trasferta”) and obtain **A1** from UK HMRC. |\n| **Secondment (non‑posting)** | Unlimited | Must **pay INPS** (Italian) + possibly UK NI (dual) | May become Italian tax‑resident after 183 days | Need a **bilateral agreement** (often a “secondment agreement”) and possibly a **double‑social‑security contribution**. |\n\n**Bottom line:** If you can keep the arrangement within the **posting** regime (≤ 24 months), you **avoid Italian INPS contributions** and the only extra cost is the **UK employer NI (13.8 %)**. If you exceed that period, you will have to start paying INPS (≈ 30 % of gross) – at which point the Italian‑employment route becomes cheaper.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Managerial / “Dirigente” Status – Does it change the tax picture?\n\n| Jurisdiction | Legal definition of “manager” | Tax / social‑security impact | Additional employer duties |\n|--------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Italy** | *Dirigente* (executive) – a person with **autonomous decision‑making powers**, usually a member of the board or senior management, and **not subject to the ordinary hierarchy**. | - **Lower INPS contribution base** (capped at € 101 427). <br>- **Employer NI rate** drops from 33 % to **24 %** (plus 0.5‑2 % local). <br>- No obligation to pay *Cassa Integrazione* or *TFR* (severance) in the same way as rank‑and‑file (though *TFR* still accrues). | Must provide a **written contract** stating *dirigente* status, and the employee must be **registered in the “Registro dei Dirigenti”** (if the company has > 50 employees). |\n| **UK** | *Executive* – not a specific legal category, but **IR35** (off‑payroll) rules apply if the employee is effectively a “personal service company” or contractor. | No special NI rate – **standard employer NI 13.8 %** applies. | Must ensure the contract is **“inside IR35”** (i.e., genuine employment) to avoid the “deemed employer” liability. |\n| **Cross‑border** | If the employee is a *dirigente* in Italy but employed by the UK subsidiary, the *dirigente* label **does not apply** for Italian INPS purposes (because he is not under Italian payroll). | You **lose** the reduced INPS rate; you would have to pay the full 33 % (or the posting‑exempt 0 %). | You would need a **local Italian contract** to claim *dirigente* status – which defeats the purpose of using the UK subsidiary. |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **If you want the “dirigente” tax advantage**, you must **employ the person directly in Italy** (Option A).  \n- The *dirigente* status also gives the employee **higher statutory severance (TFR)** and **more generous pension accrual**, which can be a selling point for recruitment.  \n- The UK route **cannot** replicate the *dirigente* regime; you would pay the standard UK NI plus any posting surcharge.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Immigration / Work‑Permit Requirements for a UK Citizen in Italy  \n\n| Situation | Visa / permit needed? | How to obtain it | Approx. processing time | Cost (2024) |\n|----------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| **UK national with no Italian/EU citizenship** | **Yes** – a **“subordinate work permit”** (permesso di soggiorno per lavoro subordinato) or a **EU Blue Card** if the salary meets the threshold (€ 43 000 gross/yr in 2024). | 1. Obtain a **job offer** and a **“nulla osta”** (work‑authorization) from the **Italian Ministry of Labour (Sportello Unico per l’Immigrazione)**. <br>2. Apply for a **national visa (type D)** at the Italian consulate in the UK. <br>3. Once in Italy, convert to a **permesso di soggiorno** (usually 30 days after arrival). | 4‑8 weeks for the nulla osta + 2‑4 weeks for the visa. | € 116 (visa) + € 80 (permesso) + possible legal fees. |\n| **UK national with an Italian/EU passport** | **No** – free movement still applies for EU citizens; UK citizens **do not** enjoy this after Brexit. | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| **UK national with a “Family‑reunification” or “Highly‑Skilled Worker” (Blue Card)** | **Yes**, but the Blue Card is a **EU‑wide permit** and is accepted in Italy. | Must meet salary threshold and have a **higher‑education degree**. | 2‑3 months | € 140 (application). |\n| **Short‑term (≤ 90 days) business trips** | **No** – can enter visa‑free for tourism/business, but **cannot perform subordinate work**. | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n\n**Key points for your case**\n\n1. **If you choose Option A (Italian employment)** you **must secure a work permit** for the UK citizen unless he already holds an Italian/EU passport or a valid residence permit.  \n2. **If you choose Option B (UK subsidiary employment)** and the employee works **physically in Italy**, the **posting regime** still requires a **work‑permit** because the employee is *physically* performing subordinate work on Italian soil. The Italian authorities treat posted workers as **“lavoratori distaccati”** and they must hold a **valid residence permit** (the same as a directly‑employed worker).  \n3. The **simplest immigration route** is the **“subordinate work permit”** (nulla osta + visa D). The employer (Italian parent) can act as the **sponsor** and file the request with the **Direzione Territoriale del Lavoro (DTL)**.  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Side‑by‑side cost comparison (illustrative)\n\nAssume a **gross annual salary of € 80 000** (≈ £ 70 000).
