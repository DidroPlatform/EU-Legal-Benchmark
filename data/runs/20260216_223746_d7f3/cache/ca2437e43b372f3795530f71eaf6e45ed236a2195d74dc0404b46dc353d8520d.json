non‑compliance with ASC 740/IAS 12. | **% of DT‑A balances reviewed against the 50 % test** (count of DT‑A balances that have a documented “more‑than‑50 %” assessment ÷ total DT‑A balances). | ≥ 95 % reviewed each FY. | Automated extraction from the tax‑accounting system; cross‑checked with the “DT‑A Review Log”. | **Quarterly** – KPI slide in Q‑board pack; **Annual** deep‑dive with supporting work‑papers. | Tax‑Accounting Lead |\n| **2** | **DT‑A Documentation Repository** – Centralised, version‑controlled repository (SharePoint/OneDrive) for all DT‑A supporting calculations, assumptions, and board approvals. | Missing or outdated documentation → audit findings, GAAR challenge. | **Document completeness score** = (Number of DT‑A files with all required artefacts – missing items) ÷ total DT‑A files. | ≥ 98 % completeness. | Quarterly audit of repository metadata + random sample verification. | **Quarterly** – Repository health dashboard; **Ad‑hoc** when a write‑off is proposed. | Tax Ops Manager |\n| **3** | **DPT Defence Checklist** – Pre‑transaction checklist that confirms the DPT meets the “substance‑over‑form” test, the “no‑tax‑avoidance” test, and the “public‑policy” test. | GAAR exposure on DPT structures; reputational risk. | **Checklist pass‑rate** = (Number of DPT transactions that cleared all checklist items ÷ total DPT transactions). | 100 % (no exception tolerated). | Automated workflow (e.g., ServiceNow) that forces “sign‑off” before transaction booking. | **Monthly** – Summary of new DPT transactions + any exceptions; **Quarterly** – Trend analysis. | DPT Governance Lead |\n| **4** | **GAAR Exposure Register** – Central register of all transactions that have a GAAR risk rating (Low/Medium/High). | Undetected GAAR‑triggering arrangements → tax adjustments, penalties. | **% of High‑Risk items with mitigation plan approved** = (High‑risk items with documented mitigation ÷ total High‑risk items). | ≥ 90 % within 30 days of identification. | Risk‑engine scoring (rules‑based) + manual review; status tracked in the register. | **Monthly** – Register snapshot; **Quarterly** – Heat‑map of risk exposure and mitigation status. | GAAR Risk Officer |\n| **5** | **Tax‑Law Change Impact Assessment** – Formal process to capture legislative changes (e.g., OECD‑BEPS, local anti‑avoidance rules) and assess impact on DT‑A, DPT, GAAR. | Out‑of‑date controls → non‑compliance. | **Average days to close impact assessment** (Date of law change publication → date assessment signed off). | ≤ 30 days for major changes; ≤ 60 days for minor changes. | Calendar tracking in the Tax‑Change Management tool. | **Monthly** – “Change‑log” KPI; **Quarterly** – Summary of material changes and actions taken. | Tax Policy Lead |\n| **6** | **Training & Competency Matrix** – Annual mandatory training on DT‑A, DPT, GAAR for tax, finance, legal, and business‑unit staff. | Knowledge gaps → control breakdown. | **Training completion rate** = (Number of required staff who completed training ÷ total required staff). | ≥ 100 % by 31 Mar each FY. | LMS reporting; certification stored in HRIS. | **Quarterly** – Completion % per function; **Annual** – Certification audit. | Learning & Development (L&D) Partner |\n| **7** | **Independent Tax‑Compliance Review** – External or internal audit of the entire DT‑A/DPT/GAAR control set‑up. | Assurance gap; audit‑committee confidence. | **Number of audit findings** (severity‑weighted). | Zero “high‑severity” findings; ≤ 2 “moderate” findings per year. | Annual external tax‑audit; internal control self‑assessment. | **Annually** – Full audit‑report package; **Quarterly** – Management response status. | Internal Audit Lead |\n| **8** | **Exception Management & Escalation** – Formal log for any deviation from policy (e.g., DT‑A write‑off without 50 % test, DPT checklist bypass). | Uncontrolled exceptions → hidden risk. | **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) exceptions** = Σ (Resolution date – Log date) ÷ number of exceptions. | ≤ 15 days for “medium” and ≤ 5 days for “high” severity. | Exception‑tracking system (e.g., JIRA). | **Monthly** – Exception dashboard; **Quarterly** – Trend & root‑cause analysis. | Compliance Officer |\n| **9** | **Data‑Integrity Controls** – Validation of tax‑accounting data feeds (e.g., ERP → tax‑module) to ensure no “ghost” DT‑A or DPT entries. | Incorrect data → false KPI reporting. | **Data‑reconciliation error rate** = (Number of mismatched records ÷ total records processed). | ≤ 0.1 % per month. | Automated reconciliation scripts; exception alerts. | **Monthly** – Reconciliation summary; **Quarterly** – Exception drill‑down. | Finance Systems Owner |\n| **10** | **Board‑Level Reporting Package** – Consolidated “Tax‑Risk Dashboard” that rolls up the above KPIs, risk‑heat maps, and exception trends. | Lack of visibility for the Audit Committee. | **Dashboard completeness score** = (All required KPI widgets present & up‑to‑date ÷ total required widgets). | 100 % for each reporting cycle. | Dashboard built in Power BI/Tableau; automated data refresh. | **Quarterly** – Formal presentation at Audit Committee meeting; **Ad‑hoc** – When a high‑severity GAAR event occurs. | CFO Office (Risk Reporting Lead) |\n\n---\n\n### How the Framework Works in Practice  \n\n1. **Risk Identification (COSO – Risk Assessment)**  \n   * The **GAAR Exposure Register** and **Tax‑Law Change Impact Assessment** continuously surface new risks.  \n   * Each risk is classified (Low/Medium/High) and assigned an owner.\n\n2. **Control Design (COSO – Control Activities)**  \n   * For every identified risk we have a **control point** (policy, checklist, repository, training, etc.).  \n   * Controls are **documented** in the **Control‑Activity Register** and linked to the relevant KPI.\n\n3. **Information & Communication (COSO – Information & Communication)**  \n   * KPI data flow: source system → KPI engine → Power BI dashboard → Audit‑Committee package.  \n   * **Exception Management** forces immediate notification to the CFO and the Audit Committee when a control fails.\n\n4. **Monitoring (COSO – Monitoring Activities)**  \n   * **Monthly** operational reports (KPIs, exception logs, data‑integrity) are reviewed by the **Risk‑Management Office**.  \n   * **Quarterly** board‑level package is signed off by the CFO, the Tax‑Policy Lead, and Internal Audit before distribution.  \n   * **Annual** external tax‑audit validates the entire control environment.\n\n5. **Feedback & Continuous Improvement**  \n   * After each Audit‑Committee meeting, a **Control‑Improvement Action Log** captures any agreed enhancements (e.g., tightening the DT‑A review frequency).  \n   * The **MTTR for exceptions** KPI drives process‑improvement cycles.\n\n---\n\n## Sample “Tax‑Risk Dashboard” (What the Committee Will See)\n\n| KPI | Current Value | Target | Trend (3‑M) | Comment |\n|-----|---------------|--------|------------|---------|\n| % DT‑A balances reviewed (≥ 50 % test) | 96 % | ≥ 95 % | ↗︎ | All major jurisdictions on schedule. |\n| DT‑A documentation completeness | 99 % | ≥ 98 % | – | Two minor missing annexes – being remedied. |\n| DPT checklist pass‑rate | 100 % | 100 % | – | No exceptions this quarter. |\n| High‑risk GAAR items with mitigation plan | 92 % | ≥ 90 % | ↘︎ | One new high‑risk DPT flagged; mitigation in progress (expected 12 days). |\n| Avg days to close tax‑law impact assessment | 22 days | ≤ 30 days | ↔︎ | Recent BEPS update closed in 18 days. |\n| Training completion (FY) | 100 % | 100 % | – | All staff certified. |\n| Audit‑findings (severity‑weighted) | 0 high / 1 moderate | 0 high / ≤ 2 moderate | – | Moderate finding on data‑reconciliation – corrective action underway. |\n| Data‑reconciliation error rate | 0.04 % | ≤ 0.1 % | – | Within tolerance. |\n| MTTR for high‑severity exceptions | 4 days | ≤ 5 days | ↗︎ | Improved from 7 days last quarter. |\n| Dashboard completeness | 100 % | 100 % | – | All widgets refreshed on schedule. |\n\n*The dashboard is refreshed automatically on the **first business day of each month**;
