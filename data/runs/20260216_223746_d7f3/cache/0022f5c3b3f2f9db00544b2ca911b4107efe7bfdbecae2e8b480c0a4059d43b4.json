The candidate answer addresses this directly in the table under 'Empirical Impact on Racial/Ethnic Gap' for each policy feature (e.g., US EEOC data showing narrowing of the Black-white wage gap, Washington State data showing Black applicants receiving higher initial offers). Furthermore, Section 1.1, point 3, explicitly discusses why 'Intersectional Gains Are Slower' for racial/ethnic gaps, and Recommendation 1 mandates requiring 'both gender and race/ethnicity (and intersection)' data.
