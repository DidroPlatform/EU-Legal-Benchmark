The candidate answer discusses Section 245A extensively in the context of equity financing, noting that it provides a 100 percent deduction for foreign-source dividends received by a domestic corporation from a specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation. It then mentions that the Section 956 relief for domestic corporate shareholders does not apply to the extent the dividend would be a hybrid dividend under Section 245A(e). While this mentions Section 245A(e) in relation to Section 956, it does not explicitly state the core rule that the Section 245A deduction itself is unavailable for hybrid dividends as defined under Section 245A(e). The response fails to directly address the specific negative constraint required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3ed4a2a0-3f87-456e-81c3-7a1566489e89\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4353, "completion_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 4594}, "latency_s": 0.9165608329931274, "request_id": "Q8WUadSGOqrw7M8Pw5-qsA8", "raw_response": null}
