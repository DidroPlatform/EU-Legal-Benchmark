The candidate answer focuses heavily on the PE risk arising from the GP's activities (which are implied to be UK-based or lacking NL substance) and the PPT risk on the treaty benefit, but it does not explicitly analyze or suggest that UK-based management *avoids* the PE risk in the Netherlands. In fact, the analysis suggests that UK-based decision-making combined with a nominal GP in NL *increases* the risk of PE attribution to the UK LP under Dutch scrutiny.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e1522b6a-f03f-477e-acad-a08fa97db3b2\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1067, "completion_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 1249}, "latency_s": 0.7349121669540182, "request_id": "giOVadn6LOjpnsEP173biQg", "raw_response": null}
