The candidate answer discusses promotional discounts in section 3(C) and suggests negotiating limits on discount percentage, duration, and freebies. However, it does not provide a concrete example clause that explicitly links these limits to the French fixed-price regime (Loi Lang) as required by the criterion's example format (\\\"Add a clause limiting discounts to 5% for up to 30 days with prior notice.\\\"). The suggestions are general negotiation points rather than a specific, formatted clause recommendation meeting the strict requirement of the rubric.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e4acc10a-713d-4d23-b03f-4292c71b020b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1879, "completion_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 2077}, "latency_s": 1.0234666669857688, "request_id": "ZhWVafifL43nvdIP-_OA4QQ", "raw_response": null}
