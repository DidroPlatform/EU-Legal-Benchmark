{"provider": "vercel_gateway", "model": "vercel_ai_gateway/openai/gpt-5.2", "text": "You haven’t screwed yourself by not registering. In the UK, **copyright arises automatically** as soon as you create an original work and record it (draw it/save it/upload it). Registration isn’t required for protection (unlike some aspects of US litigation strategy). You likely *do* have legal angles to fight this—though the AI-training part is currently a legally unsettled battlefield and will depend heavily on what exactly was copied, where the acts happened, and what outputs look like.\n\nBelow is a practical UK-focused breakdown (not legal advice, but a map of the issues and what to do next).\n\n---\n\n## 1) Your rights exist even without registration (UK)\nIn the UK, your 40 pages of *Nexus* are protected as:\n- **Artistic works** (your drawings/character depictions)\n- **Literary work** (the script, narration, text)\n- Potentially **typographical arrangement** (if relevant in a published edition)\n\nYou own copyright unless you assigned it away (e.g., a contract) or it was created as an employee in the course of employment (freelancers/independents generally keep it).\n\n**Uploading online doesn’t put your work into the public domain.** It just makes it publicly accessible.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Two separate problems: (A) training on your pages, (B) the ad using “Ophelia”\n\n### A) Scraping/training on your entire online chapters\n**Core question:** did Synthetic Dreams Corp copy your work (download/store it) as part of training? In practice, training typically involves making copies (even if transient or stored in datasets).\n\nIn the UK, there is a **Text and Data Mining (TDM) exception** (Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, s.29A), but it is **narrow**:\n- It’s generally limited to **non‑commercial research**.\n- It doesn’t cover “we trained a commercial model for paying users.”\n\nSo if your work was copied in the UK (or by a UK entity), the UK’s TDM exception is unlikely to excuse **commercial training**.\n\n**Complication:** they’re American. If the relevant copying/training happened in the US, UK exceptions don’t directly apply and you’d be looking at **US law** for that part. But you can still potentially pursue:\n- **UK claims** if there’s UK-targeted exploitation, copying, hosting, or distribution in the UK\n- Claims against UK-based entities involved (ad agency, brand, UK publisher, UK platform)\n- Cross-border enforcement depending on facts\n\n**Bottom line on training:** in UK terms, a commercial AI company scraping and training on your work is **not clearly “safe”** under UK exceptions. But it can be procedurally hard to prove and jurisdictionally complex.\n\n---\n\n### B) The generated “slightly altered” Ophelia used in a national fizzy-drink ad\nThis is often the **stronger, clearer** claim than training.\n\nIn UK copyright law, infringement can happen if someone reproduces the whole or a **“substantial part”** of your work. “Substantial” is about **quality, not just quantity**. A character image can be a substantial part if it reproduces protectable expression (distinctive visual features, design choices, costume elements, etc.).\n\nKey questions:\n- Does the ad image **look recognisably like Ophelia** (same distinctive face/hair/outfit/silhouette/motifs)?\n- Is it close enough that an ordinary viewer would connect it to your character design?\n- Is it more than general “style” and instead copying **specific expressive features**?\n\nIf yes, that can be **copyright infringement** by:\n- the user who generated it (primary infringer), and/or\n- the advertiser/agency that used it (they can be directly liable if they used a copied work, and/or secondarily liable depending on knowledge and involvement—facts matter)\n\n**No UK “AI exception”** automatically legalises using an output that reproduces substantial parts of a protected character depiction.\n\n---\n\n## 3) “But it’s only an AI-generated lookalike”—does that avoid infringement?\nNot automatically.\n\nIf the output is genuinely independent and only shares general ideas (e.g., “goth sci‑fi heroine”), that’s safer for them. But if it reproduces distinctive protected expression (your specific character design), that’s risky for them.\n\nAlso: if the model was trained on your exact pages and then produces near‑duplicates or close variants, that can support an inference of copying (though it still needs evidence).\n\n---\n\n## 4) Your moral rights (UK) – credit and “treatment” of your work\nUK moral rights can help, but they have **limits**:\n\n### Right to be identified as author (“paternity right”)\nIn the UK, this right generally must be **asserted** in writing to bite in many common contexts. If you never asserted it (e.g., on your site/terms, or in a contract), it may be harder to enforce purely as a “you didn’t credit me” claim.\n\nThat said, **copyright infringement doesn’t require moral rights**. Lack of credit can be relevant as damages/negotiation leverage, but the main engine is usually copyright.\n\n### Right of integrity (object to derogatory treatment)\nIf the ad distorts or mutilates the work in a way prejudicial to your honour/reputation, there *may* be an argument—but it’s fact-specific and not always the easiest route.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Passing off / false endorsement (possible, fact-dependent)\nIf the ad implies you were involved, endorsed it, or it trades on your reputation (especially if *Nexus* has a following), there may be a UK **passing off** angle. This requires goodwill, misrepresentation, and damage—harder if you’re early-career, but not impossible if you can show a real fanbase/recognition.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Evidence you should preserve right now (critical)\nBefore contacting anyone, gather and preserve:\n\n1. **Your creation files:** PSD/Procreate/Clip Studio files, sketches, timestamps, layer history.\n2. **Upload proof:** screenshots + URLs + dates for where you posted *Nexus*.\n3. **The ad:** save video files, stills, screenshots, where it aired, dates, brand, agency credits.\n4. **The generated image + prompt (if possible):** try to capture the user’s post, prompt, seed, model version, and any “credit” lines.\n5. **Signs the model trained on your work:** any “model can produce Ophelia/Nexus pages,” near-duplicates, marketing claims, dataset leaks, third-party reports.\n\nAlso consider sending yourself a copy of key files by email or storing with a reputable timestamping service; it helps with proving dates (not a magic shield, but useful).\n\n---\n\n## 7) Practical enforcement options (UK-focused)\n### For the advert (often the quickest win)\n- **Solicitor letter before action** to the brand + ad agency + publisher/broadcaster demanding:\n  - immediate takedown/stop use\n  - preservation of documents (prompts, source assets, approvals)\n  - disclosure of how it was made (tools, prompts, model)\n  - compensation / licence fee / damages\n  - corrective credit (if you want it)\n\nBrands are often risk-averse; if the image is close to your character, they may pull it.\n\n### For Synthetic Dreams Corp\nOptions vary based on where they operate and where infringement occurred:\n- a formal notice demanding:\n  - confirmation whether your work was in training data\n  - deletion/exclusion (some companies offer “opt-out,” though enforceability varies)\n  - non-use assurances and/or settlement\n- if there’s a UK nexus (UK users/marketing/offices/servers), UK action becomes more feasible.\n\n---\n\n## 8) Do you “have a chance”?\nYes—especially regarding the **advert** if the character depiction is recognisably derived from your protectable design.\n\nThe **training claim** is more complex (jurisdiction + evolving law + proof), but it’s not automatically excused under UK law for commercial model training.\n\n---\n\n## 9) What I need from you to give a more precise view\nIf you can answer these (even roughly), I can assess strength and best next steps:\n\n1. Where did you upload *Nexus* (your site, Instagram, Webtoon, etc.) and did the page have any terms like “no scraping”?\n2. Is the ad running in the UK, the US, or both?\n3. How close is the generated Ophelia to your original (same outfit/face/hair/symbols)? If you can share images (your character + the ad still), I can compare at a high level.\n4. Do you know whether Synthetic Dreams Corp has any UK presence or markets heavily to UK users?\n\n---\n\n## 10) Immediate “do this now” checklist\n- Don’t accuse publicly yet (keep leverage, avoid defamation risks).\n- Archive everything (as above).\n- Identify the **brand + agency + publisher** and send a **formal complaint** (ideally via solicitor).\n- Consider a UK solicitor who does **IP/copyright** (many offer a short fixed-fee consult).\n- If you want, I can help you draft a **non-inflammatory initial notice** to the brand/agency to preserve evidence and request takedown.\n\nIf you upload (1) a page showing Ophelia clearly and (2) a screenshot/still from the ad, I can tell you whether—visually—it looks like “substantial part” copying versus a generic resemblance, and suggest what to say in the first letter.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 258, "completion_tokens": 2029, "total_tokens": 2287}, "latency_s": 49.88285820800229, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJ2Q0VNTTRA63GDNPFD8CJ", "raw_response": null}
