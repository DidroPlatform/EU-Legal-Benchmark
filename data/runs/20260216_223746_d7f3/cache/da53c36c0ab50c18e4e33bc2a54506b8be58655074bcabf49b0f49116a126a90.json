The candidate answer mentions Sturges v Bridgman (1879) 11 Ch D 852 in the table under the 'Unreasonableness' section, stating it is one of the cases courts use to balance rights. However, the response does not explicitly state *that* Sturges v Bridgman established the principle that the character of a neighbourhood (locality) is a factor in determining unreasonableness. It lists locality as a factor but attributes the principle of balancing rights to Sturges v Bridgman without clearly articulating the specific legal establishment mentioned in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"97931869-c2f0-47c9-a3b2-957e3f72280e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1815, "completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 2017}, "latency_s": 0.9891020000213757, "request_id": "BSmVaexXkL6ewQ_EyaThBg", "raw_response": null}
