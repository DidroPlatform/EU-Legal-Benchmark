{"provider": "nim", "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", "text": " This is a devastating position, but **your solicitor may be oversimplifying the position on priority**—there is a crucial technical argument here about trusts and overreaching that could change the outcome, though it is fact-specific and jurisdiction-dependent (assuming UK or Irish law given the terminology).\n\nHere is the reality of what you are facing, and the potential chinks in the armour:\n\n## 1. The \"Sole Trustee\" Problem (Why the Lender Might NOT Have Priority)\n\nIf you succeed in establishing a constructive trust (i.e., proving the property is held by your ex on trust for both of you in shares reflecting your contributions), your ex is not just the legal owner—they are a **sole trustee** holding the legal title for the benefit of both of you.\n\n**This is critical:** Under English law (and similar principles apply in Ireland), a mortgage by a **sole trustee** does **not** overreach the beneficiaries’ interests. Overreaching (which pushes the beneficiaries’ interests off the land and attaches them to the sale proceeds) only occurs if the mortgage is granted by **two trustees** or a trust corporation.\n\nTherefore, if your ex is a sole trustee:\n- The lender’s charge takes effect **subject to your beneficial interest**; it does not automatically wipe it out.\n- The lender would only take priority if they can prove they were a **bona fide purchaser for value without notice** of your interest.\n\n**The Notice Question:** Did the lender know, or should they have known, about your claim? Did they survey the property and see evidence of two people living there? Did they ask about beneficial interests? Standard lending protocols require enquiry about occupiers. If you were in **actual occupation** when the mortgage was granted (even if you had moved out recently), and if the property is registered land, your interest might override the mortgage under the \"actual occupation\" provisions (Schedule 3, Land Registration Act 2002 in England; similar principles exist elsewhere).\n\n**Action:** Check the mortgage application. If your ex declared \"no other occupiers\" or failed to disclose your interest when you were clearly living there or had contributed to the purchase/renovations, the lender may have constructive or actual notice of your claim.\n\n## 2. The Further Advance (Tacking)\n\nA \"further advance\" of €200k taken six months ago is likely \"tacked\" onto the existing mortgage, meaning it shares the priority of the original charge. However:\n- If the original mortgage terms limited further advances without consent, and the lender breached their own terms, the priority of the €200k might be restricted to the date it was advanced, potentially ranking after your interest if your constructive trust arose earlier (which it did, when you paid for renovations).\n- If the further advance was fraudulently obtained (your ex misrepresented their authority to mortgage or concealed your interest), the lender’s priority is vulnerable, though banks are usually protected unless they actually participated in the fraud.\n\n## 3. Is the Lender's Charge \"Eating All Equity\" Inevitable?\n\n**Only if:**\n- You were not in actual occupation at the time of the mortgage; **and**\n- You had not registered a unilateral notice or restriction at the Land Registry; **and**\n- The lender had no actual or constructive knowledge of your contributions; **and**\n- The property value minus the €200k debt leaves insufficient equity to cover your €180k claim.\n\n**However**, if you can establish the lender had **notice** or if the **sole trustee argument** succeeds, the lender is bound by your interest. They cannot enforce their charge without accounting to you for your share of the equity. In that scenario, the charge does not \"eat up\" your equity—you are entitled to your proportion of the net sale proceeds before the lender gets the remainder.\n\n## 4. The Slander of Title Claim\n\nThis is almost certainly a tactical weapon. Slander of title requires:\n- A false statement disparaging your title;\n- Malice; and\n- Special damage (actual financial loss).\n\nIf your ex is offering to drop it in exchange for you abandoning €180k, it suggests the claim is weak or defensible. Do not let this bully you. If you have evidence of your contributions (receipts, bank transfers, messages discussing the property as \"ours\"), the slander claim is likely a bluff to pressure you into accepting the \"lender priority\" narrative.\n\n## Immediate Strategic Steps\n\n1. **Check the Land Registry title immediately**: Was a restriction registered? Were you in actual occupation when the mortgage was granted? If yes, you may have an overriding interest.\n2. **Investigate the lender's due diligence**: Request the mortgage application file (through disclosure/disclosure rules). If your ex ticked \"single owner\" or denied other interests while you were paying for renovations, the lender may have constructive notice.\n3. **Argue the Sole Trustee point**: Your constructive trust claim, if proven, makes your ex a trustee. A mortgage by a sole trustee does not overreach your interest. The lender takes subject to it.\n4. **Challenge the Further Advance**: Demand proof the further advance was permitted under the original mortgage terms. If not, argue it ranks behind your interest (which crystallised when you invested money).\n5. **Personal Claim Against Your Ex**: Even if the lender wins on priority, you have a massive personal claim against your ex for breach of trust, fraud, or unjust enrichment. If they have other assets, you can enforce against those. Do not accept \"the lender gets everything\" without exploring whether your ex can be made personally bankrupt to satisfy your judgment.\n6. **Negotiate with the Lender directly**: Banks hate litigation risk and bad publicity. If you can show their surveyor should have spotted two occupants or their solicitor failed to enquire about beneficial interests, they may negotiate a partial discharge or accept a second-ranking position rather than face a trial over their due diligence failures.\n\n**Do not walk away from €180k based on your ex's solicitor's threat.** Get a second opinion from a property litigation specialist who specifically understands **trusts of land and mortgage overreaching**. The fact that your ex is trying to settle suggests they fear you have a valid constructive trust claim that binds the property.\n\nThe bank is not invincible here, but you are in a knife fight.
