The Arbitration Act 1996, Section 44**\n- Courts retain power to grant interim measures in support of arbitration\n- This includes freezing injunctions\n- The clause doesn't automatically oust court jurisdiction over interim relief\n\n**2. The \"Spiliada\" Approach**\nEnglish courts consider:\n- Whether the arbitration clause is valid and covers the dispute\n- The stage of arbitration proceedings\n- Whether the arbitral tribunal could grant equivalent relief\n- Practical effectiveness of either forum\n- Comity and avoiding conflicting orders\n\n## How Courts Balance the Competing Interests\n\n### Factors Favoring Court Intervention\n\n- **Urgency**: If the tribunal can't act quickly enough to prevent asset dissipation\n- **Enforceability**: English court orders may be more readily enforceable against foreign assets\n- **Tribunal limitations**: Some arbitral seats have weaker interim powers\n- **Early stage**: If arbitration hasn't properly commenced\n\n### Factors Favoring Restraint\n\n- **Mature arbitration**: If the tribunal is already seized and capable\n- **Parallel proceedings risk**: Avoiding conflicting orders between courts and tribunal\n- **Party autonomy**: Respecting the arbitration agreement\n- **Tribunal's own powers**: Singapore arbitration has robust interim relief mechanisms\n\n## The Singapore Complication\n\nThis matters because:\n\n- **Singapore arbitration law** (International Arbitration Act) gives tribunals broad interim powers\n- **Singapore courts** are also willing to support arbitration\n- **Dual proceedings** create real risk of conflicting orders\n- English courts will likely ask: *Why not ask the Singapore tribunal first?*\n\n## Practical Scenarios\n\n| Scenario | Likely Outcome |\n|----------|---|\n| Urgent asset dissipation, tribunal not yet constituted | Court likely grants injunction |\n| Tribunal already seized and capable | Court may decline or stay its own proceedings |\n| Defendant based in UK with UK assets | Court more willing to intervene |\n| Defendant foreign with foreign assets | Court more cautious; may defer to tribunal |\n\n## Recent Approach: *Cetelem Bank* Principles\n\nEnglish courts now typically:\n\n1. **Don't automatically refuse** just because arbitration exists\n2. **Require strong justification** for parallel proceedings\n3. **Prefer coordination** between court and tribunal\n4. **May impose conditions** (e.g., tribunal's consent, undertakings)\n\n## Strategic Considerations\n\n**If you're seeking the injunction:**\n- Explain why the Singapore tribunal can't act fast enough\n- Show urgency and risk of irreparable harm\n- Offer undertakings to minimize conflict\n- Consider applying to the tribunal *simultaneously*\n\n**If you're resisting:**\n- Argue the tribunal is capable and should be given priority\n- Highlight the arbitration agreement's exclusivity\n- Point to Singapore's strong interim relief framework\n- Emphasize comity concerns\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe injunction can stand, but English courts will scrutinize whether it's truly necessary or whether it's an end-run around the arbitration clause. The court won't simply defer to arbitration, but it won't ignore it either.\n\n**The real question isn't \"can the court act?\" but \"should it, given the circumstances?\"** — and that depends heavily on the specific facts, the tribunal's readiness, and the urgency of the situation.\n\nWould you like me to explore the practical steps for coordinating between the court and tribunal, or the enforceability issues that follow?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 59, "completion_tokens": 865, "total_tokens": 924}, "latency_s": 11.7455972910102, "request_id": "chatcmpl-5c209aa3-1d8c-4bb2-b8c8-271c3a15de04", "raw_response": null}
