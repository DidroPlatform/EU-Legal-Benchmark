This means the board will likely *not* side with Belgium's assertion that the refusal was a further violation. However, the criterion asks whether the board will likely side with *Spain*. Since the board is likely to dismiss the entire matter due to jurisdiction, it does not explicitly 'side with Spain' on the merits of the cooperation issue, but rather avoids ruling on it. More critically, the candidate answer acknowledges that the initial alleged violation (unmarked gear) is valid under Article 5 and that Spain has an obligation to enforce it (Article 8(1)). If the board were to rule on the matter, siding with Spain would imply that the refusal to cooperate was *not* a violation, which the candidate argues is true. However, the primary conclusion is jurisdictional dismissal. Since the core issue is whether the board will rule in Spain's favor regarding the *refusal to cooperate*, and the candidate argues the refusal was not a violation, this leans towards siding with Spain on that specific point, but the jurisdictional dismissal is a stronger conclusion. Given the ambiguity of 'siding with Spain' when the matter is dismissed, and the fact that the initial violation (marking) is acknowledged against Spain, I cannot confidently assign a 1. The candidate's conclusion is that the board will likely dismiss the claim against Spain regarding the *further* violation, which is favorable to Spain, but the overall outcome is non-adjudication.\", \"criterion_id\": \"criterion 8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1556, "completion_tokens": 355, "total_tokens": 1911}, "latency_s": 10.65124974999344, "request_id": "sTWVabLZNMyynsEPyd_uiAQ", "raw_response": null}
