He published 'A Memory of Solferino' in 1862, but the inspiration came from Solferino, not the American Civil War. Statement ii is incorrect: Popular initiatives violating international law are not automatically declared invalid by the Federal Assembly; they can be put to a vote, though they may face legal challenges. Statement iii is correct: Intention (dolus) is defined in the specific part of the Swiss Criminal Code. Statement iv is incorrect: Constitutional principles of administrative law apply to both the confederation and the cantons - they are not limited only to the confederation. Therefore, statements i, ii, and iv are incorrect.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 346, "completion_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 534}, "latency_s": 3.1345474160043523, "request_id": "chatcmpl-adca9d34-7b19-4149-a4c0-295b36a8fd81", "raw_response": null}
