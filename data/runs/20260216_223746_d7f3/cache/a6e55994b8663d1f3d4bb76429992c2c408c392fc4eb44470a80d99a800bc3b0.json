The candidate answer states under 'Responsibilities of the Guardian (Amministratore di Sostegno)': 'Personal care: Healthcare decisions, living arrangements, daily support (as specified).' and later clarifies under 'Financial management': '...property sales (needs judge approval for big acts).' While it doesn't explicitly list 'care facility placement' as needing approval, the general statement that responsibilities are defined in the decree and that major acts (which placement usually is) require judge approval strongly implies this requirement, especially when contrasted with the general mention of 'living arrangements' under personal care. Furthermore, the context of AdS implies that significant changes to personal life, like moving to a nursing home, require judicial oversight, which is covered by the general scope of the guardian's duties being defined by the judge and requiring approval for major acts.\", \"criterion_id\": \"25bedebd-d62e-4f63-a40a-110ddd7d1e08\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1460, "completion_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 1702}, "latency_s": 0.9477820830070414, "request_id": "KyWVabjGPNuxnsEPg_7zyAU", "raw_response": null}
