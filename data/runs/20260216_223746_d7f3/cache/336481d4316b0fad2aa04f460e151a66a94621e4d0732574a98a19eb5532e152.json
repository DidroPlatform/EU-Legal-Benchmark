The candidate answer discusses the liability of the third-party assessor, stating they could be liable for professional negligence if the FRA was inadequate (e.g., failed to identify PAT testing as a necessary control). However, it does not explicitly address the conditional statement required by the rubric: that the assessor would be absolved of blame *if* the report *did* mention the responsibility to maintain electrical equipment. Since the prompt states the report *did not* mention PAT testing, the response should have focused on whether mentioning maintenance responsibility would shield the assessor from liability in this specific context, which it fails to do.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c3f440bd-74b7-4346-bb37-641760e3aa9f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3470, "completion_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 3681}, "latency_s": 1.0624577080016024, "request_id": "fPuUaaS6DfDm7M8PqbvO6QU", "raw_response": null}
