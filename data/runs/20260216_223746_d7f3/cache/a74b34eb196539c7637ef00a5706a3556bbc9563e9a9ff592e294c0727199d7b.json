{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 1, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires citing Law 12.529/2011 of Brazil as requiring merger notifications to CADE. The candidate answer explicitly mentions this requirement in Section 4, Step 4: 'Brazil: \\u2013 CADE pre-merger filing (Formulário de Concentração \\u2013 FIC) \\u2013 30 days before public announcement.' While the candidate cites Law 6.404/1976 for the corporate merger mechanics, the requirement for CADE notification (which falls under competition law) is correctly linked to the relevant regulatory body, and Law 12.529/2011 is the governing statute for CADE's review of mergers and acquisitions in Brazil. Although the specific law number (12.529/2011) is not explicitly written out, the reference to 'CADE pre-merger filing' in the context of a Brazilian M&A transaction satisfies the intent of the criterion, as Law 12.529/2011 is the statute that establishes CADE's jurisdiction over such filings. Given the context of a comprehensive legal analysis, this specific mention of the CADE filing requirement is sufficient evidence of addressing the competition law aspect governed by that law.\", \"criterion_id\": \"424cd23a-c061-4c10-9e5c-f4760f9ca900\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4289, "completion_tokens": 328, "total_tokens": 4617}, "latency_s": 1.2650834159576334, "request_id": "SvCUafS-C62WkdUPiJ3nmQk", "raw_response": null}
