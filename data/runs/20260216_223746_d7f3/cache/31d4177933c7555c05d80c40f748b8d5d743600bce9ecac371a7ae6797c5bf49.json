If successful, it results in acquittal.\n\n### Statutory Basis\n\n**Section 76, Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008** codifies the common law on self-defence and provides:\n\n**S.76(3)** - The question whether the degree of force used was reasonable in the circumstances is to be decided by reference to the circumstances **as the defendant believed them to be**.\n\n**S.76(4)** - If the defendant claims to have held a particular belief:\n- The reasonableness/unreasonableness of that belief is relevant to whether it was genuinely held\n- But if genuinely held, the belief need not be reasonable\n\n**S.76(6)** - In assessing reasonableness of force, account must be taken that \"a person acting for a legitimate purpose may not be able to weigh to a nicety the exact measure of any necessary action\"\n\n**S.76(7)** - The degree of force is **not reasonable** if it was disproportionate in the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.\n\n---\n\n## KEY ELEMENTS OF THE TEST\n\nThe jury must consider **two questions**:\n\n### 1. Was the use of force necessary? (Subjective test)\n\n- Did your client **honestly believe** it was necessary to defend himself?\n- Did he honestly believe he was under attack/imminent attack?\n- Did he honestly believe the victim was armed?\n\n**The belief need not be reasonable, but must be genuinely held** - s.76(4).\n\n### 2. Was the force used reasonable? (Objective test, but assessed on subjective facts)\n\n- Was the degree of force **objectively reasonable** in the circumstances **as your client believed them to be**?\n- This is judged by the standards of the ordinary person in the same circumstances\n\n---\n\n## HONEST BUT MISTAKEN BELIEF\n\nThis is **critical** to your client's case.\n\n### The Legal Position\n\n**Your client's mistaken belief that the victim was armed is legally irrelevant to whether self-defence is available**, provided the belief was honestly held.\n\n### Key Authorities\n\n**R v Williams (Gladstone) [1987] 3 All ER 411 (CA)**\n\n- Leading authority establishing that self-defence is judged on facts as defendant believed them to be\n- Lord Lane CJ: *\"The reasonableness or unreasonableness of the defendant's belief is material to the question of whether the belief was held by the defendant at all. If the belief was in fact held, its unreasonableness, so far as guilt or innocence is concerned, is neither here nor there.\"*\n- A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances **as he honestly believes them to be**, whether reasonably or not\n\n**R v Owino [1996] 2 Cr App R 128 (CA)**\n\n- Confirmed Williams principle\n- Collins J: *\"A defendant is to be judged according to his genuine belief as to the facts, whether that belief is reasonable or unreasonable\"*\n\n**Beckford v R [1988] AC 130 (PC)**\n\n- Privy Council approved Williams\n- Lord Griffiths: *\"A defendant is entitled to be judged according to his honest belief of the facts, however mistaken that belief may be\"*\n- Applied even where defendant (police officer) mistakenly believed deceased was armed\n\n**R v Scarlett [1993] 4 All ER 629 (CA)**\n\n- Confirmed that honest mistake as to facts does not deprive defendant of self-defence\n- Applies even if mistake was unreasonable\n\n### Statutory Confirmation\n\n**S.76(4) CJIA 2008** now codifies this principle:\n- Subsection (3) is to apply on the basis of the facts as the defendant believed them to be\n- The reasonableness or otherwise of that belief is relevant to whether it was genuinely held, but if genuinely held, the belief need not be reasonable\n\n---\n\n## APPLICATION TO YOUR CLIENT'S CASE\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. **Honest belief in threat**: Your client states he \"genuinely feared for his life\" - if jury accepts this, the mistaken belief about the victim being armed is legally immaterial\n\n2. **Initial aggressor was victim**: The victim attacked first - this supports necessity of defensive action\n\n3. **Heat of moment**: S.76(6) recognizes defendants cannot \"weigh to a nicety\" - relevant given sudden street violence\n\n4. **Mistaken belief authority**: Strong case law (Williams, Beckford) supports that unreasonable but honest mistakes don't defeat self-defence\n\n### Weaknesses/Challenges\n\n1. **Nature of force used**: Striking with **broken glass** is inherently dangerous and likely to cause serious injury\n   - Prosecution will argue this was disproportionate even if client believed victim armed\n   - Glass weapons often viewed as excessive force\n\n2. **Proportionality assessment**: Even accepting client's belief victim was armed, was using broken glass a proportionate response?\n   - Could he have retreated?\n   - Were lesser measures available?\n   - Did he continue after threat neutralized?\n\n3. **Credibility of belief**: While belief need not be reasonable, unreasonableness is relevant to whether it was genuinely held (s.76(4))\n   - Why did he think victim was armed?\n   - What did he see/hear?\n   - Lack of actual weapon may undermine credibility\n\n4. **Intoxication**: If your client was intoxicated, this may affect:\n   - Whether his belief was genuinely held\n   - Whether he formed the necessary belief at all\n   - Note: *R v Hatton [2005] EWCA Crim 2951* - intoxicated mistakes may not found self-defence\n\n5. **Availability of weapon**: How did client come to have broken glass?\n   - If he armed himself, suggests premeditation\n   - If opportunistically grabbed, less problematic\n\n---\n\n## EVIDENTIAL MATTERS\n\n### Burden of Proof\n\n- Once self-defence is raised (evidential burden on defence), prosecution must disprove it beyond reasonable doubt - **R v Lobell [1957] 1 QB 547**\n\n### Evidence Required\n\nYou should obtain:\n\n1. **Detailed proof of evidence** from client covering:\n   - Precise sequence of events\n   - What victim did/said that made client fear attack\n   - Specific reasons for believing victim armed (did he reach for something? Make threats?)\n   - Client's state of mind and fear level\n   - How broken glass came into his possession\n   - Whether retreat was possible\n\n2. **CCTV footage** (if available) - may support or undermine account\n\n3. **Witness evidence** - independent witnesses to the altercation\n\n4. **Victim's history** - any previous violence/weapons offences (admissible to show client's belief was reasonable if he knew of it)\n\n5. **Medical evidence** - extent of injuries may indicate level of force used\n\n6. **Character evidence** - client's previous good character supports honesty of belief\n\n---\n\n## JURY DIRECTIONS\n\nThe judge will direct the jury along these lines (based on **Crown Court Compendium**):\n\n1. Prosecution must prove client not acting in lawful self-defence\n\n2. Two questions:\n   - Did client believe (honestly) use of force was necessary?\n   - Was the force used reasonable in circumstances as client believed them to be?\n\n3. In assessing what client believed, jury may take into account whether belief was reasonable, but if genuinely held, it need not be reasonable\n\n4. In assessing reasonableness of force, jury should consider:\n   - Client did not have time to weigh precisely what action to take\n   - The circumstances as client believed them to be (including belief victim was armed)\n\n---\n\n## TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n### At Trial\n\n1. **Focus on client's genuine fear**: Build evidence of his subjective state of mind - this is crucial\n\n2. **Explain the mistaken belief**: Provide credible explanation for why he thought victim was armed (movement, verbal threat, lighting conditions, etc.)\n\n3. **Contextualize the force**: While broken glass is serious, if client genuinely believed victim had a weapon, this contextualizes his response\n\n4. **Character evidence**: If client has good character, this supports honesty of his belief\n\n### Plea Negotiations\n\nConsider whether prosecution might accept plea to:\n- **S.47 ABH** (if injuries support it)\n- **Common assault** (unlikely given injuries)\n- **S.20 with self-defence as mitigation** (if prospects of full defence uncertain)\n\n---\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n**Prospects**: **Moderate to reasonable**, depending on evidence\n\nYour client has a **legally sound basis** for self-defence based on honest but mistaken belief (Williams/Beckford principle, now s.76 CJIA 2008). The law is clear that his mistaken belief the victim was armed does not automatically defeat the defence.\n\n**However**, success depends on:\n\n1. **Jury accepting belief was genuinely held** - credibility is key\n2. **Jury finding force was reasonable/proportionate** - this is the greater hurdle given use of broken glass\n\n**Recommendation**: \n\n- Obtain detailed proof of evidence focusing on client's subjective belief and reasons for it\n- Secure all available supporting evidence (CCTV, witnesses)\n- Prepare client for robust cross-examination on credibility of his belief\n- Consider expert evidence on perception/reaction in violent confrontations if appropriate\n- Keep plea options under review as evidence develops\n\nThe case is **defensible** but not without risk. Much will turn on how credibly your client gives evidence and whether the jury accepts that striking with glass was a reasonable response to the threat as he perceived it.\n\n---\n\n**Prepared by**: [Your name]  \n**Date**: [Date]  \n**Next steps**: Conference with client to obtain detailed proof of evidence\n\n---\n\n*This advice is based on the limited instructions provided and may require revision as further evidence becomes available.*", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 2476, "total_tokens": 2637}, "latency_s": 45.23975058400538, "request_id": "chatcmpl-d453fa84-f2e5-4eff-b56f-15025dfb5a69", "raw_response": null}
