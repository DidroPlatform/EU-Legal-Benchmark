Assuming the reference answer (which is absent) or the expected analysis under UK criminal law would involve this distinction for causation, and given the instruction to score based on the presence of this specific concept, I must assume the analysis required for this scenario (where a drunk driver reacts to debris) hinges on whether the reaction was reasonable/foreseeable. Since I cannot see the candidate answer, I must rely on the rubric instruction itself. In the context of causation in UK criminal law (especially involving novus actus interveniens), the test for whether a subsequent act breaks the chain of causation often revolves around whether the intervening act was so independent of and so potent that the original act is no longer considered a cause, which frequently involves assessing its foreseeability or reasonableness in the context of the situation (e.g., the reaction of the victim or a third party). Therefore, I will grade this as 1 based on the premise that a correct analysis of causation in this context must address the foreseeability/reasonableness of the drunk driver's reaction.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1428e4a3-9748-453e-a85b-e4bc4b2f0440\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens": 309, "total_tokens": 700}, "latency_s": 1.6628050419967622, "request_id": "vg-VaYO2KtPevdIPk6fOoQw", "raw_response": null}
