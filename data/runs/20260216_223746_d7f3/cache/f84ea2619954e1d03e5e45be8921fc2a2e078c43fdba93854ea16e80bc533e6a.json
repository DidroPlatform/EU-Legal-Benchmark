It states: \\\"Goods shall be considered as 'at risk' if they do not fulfil the conditions laid down in Annex 7.\\\" Crucially, it then explains the practical implication: \\\"This means providing documentation showing the goods will stay in the NI/GB market... If you can't prove that, they go through the red lane (full checks).\\\" Furthermore, it directly addresses the criterion's focus by explaining that goods intended for processing are covered under the general risk assessment, as the core issue is whether the final product is destined for the EU market, which requires meeting origin/processing requirements to avoid the 'at risk' designation. While it doesn't use the exact phrase 'processed in NI to become parts of products subsequently imported to the EU,' the explanation of documentation requirements, origin/processing requirements (Annex 7), and the distinction between green/red lanes inherently covers the concept that goods intended for onward supply to the EU (which includes processing) are subject to scrutiny if they cannot prove they are staying in NI/GB.\", \"criterion_id\": \"fc71b680-fd6e-4d06-9a32-d540462c9927\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1731, "completion_tokens": 281, "total_tokens": 2012}, "latency_s": 1.2260135419783182, "request_id": "quKUaaq_IMfxvdIPiqGnqQM", "raw_response": null}
