The exact outcome will depend on the **specific jurisdiction**, the exact wording of the mortgage deed, the registration regime, and the facts you can prove (e.g., whether the bank had actual or constructive notice of your interest).  You should obtain **local counsel** as soon as possible.  The analysis below will help you understand the issues and the questions you need to ask your lawyer.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why a registered mortgage normally outranks a later constructive‑trust claim\n\n| Concept | How it works in most jurisdictions | Why it usually beats a later equitable claim |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Legal title vs. equitable (beneficial) title** | The person whose name is on the land‑registry (or the “title register”) holds *legal* title.  A person who contributed to the purchase or improvement may acquire an *equitable* interest (e.g., via a constructive trust). | The mortgage is a **real right** that attaches to the *legal* title.  Once the mortgage is **registered**, it becomes a **priority lien** that “runs with the land” and is enforceable against anyone who later acquires an interest, even an equitable one. |\n| **Bona‑fide purchaser for value (BFP)** | The bank gave value (the loan) and, if it had no actual notice of your interest at the time of registration, is treated as a BFP. | BFP status gives the mortgage **priority over unregistered or later‑registered interests**, including constructive trusts, unless the mortgage is itself void or the bank had notice of the prior interest. |\n| **Registration is key** | In most civil‑law systems (e.g., Spain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands) the mortgage must be entered in the land‑registry to be enforceable.  In England & Wales the mortgage must be “protected” by registration at HM Land Registry. | A registered mortgage “wins” over any later‑registered equitable interest because the register is the definitive source of priority. |\n| **Equitable remedies (constructive trust, unjust enrichment, contribution)** | These are **personal** rights against the party who caused the equity (your ex).  They give you a claim for **money** or a **share of the proceeds** when the property is sold, but they do **not** automatically remove the lender’s charge. | The lender’s charge is a **real right** that can be enforced by sale of the property; your equitable claim only tells the court how the **sale proceeds** should be divided *after* the mortgage is satisfied. |\n\n**Bottom line:** If the €200 k mortgage was **properly executed and registered**, the bank will, in most jurisdictions, be able to **realise its debt first**.  Your constructive‑trust claim will then be a **right to the remainder of the equity** (if any) or a right to **contribute** against your ex for the value you added.\n\n---\n\n## 2. When the lender’s priority can be contested – “secret loan” arguments\n\nBelow are the **main legal theories** that can be raised to try to **knock down or subordinate** the bank’s charge.  Each of them is **high‑risk** and success depends heavily on the facts and the jurisdiction.\n\n| Theory | What you must prove | How it affects the mortgage | Likelihood (general) |\n|--------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|\n| **1. Lack of authority / Void mortgage** | Show that the borrower (your ex) **did not have the legal authority** to mortgage the whole property (e.g., you were a co‑owner, you held a 50 % legal title, or the mortgage was taken out on the *entire* property without your consent). | If the mortgage is **void** (or voidable) for lack of authority, the bank’s charge is **null** and cannot be enforced against you. | **Medium‑high** if you are a *registered co‑owner* and the mortgage was taken out **without your signature**.  In many civil‑law states a co‑owner’s consent is required for a mortgage on the whole property. |\n| **2. Mortgage not registered / defective registration** | Prove that the mortgage was never entered in the land‑registry (or that the entry was defective – e.g., wrong parcel number, missing annex). | An unregistered mortgage may be **unenforceable against third parties** (including you) and may be treated as a personal loan against the borrower only. | **High** if you can obtain a copy of the register and it shows no entry.  In England & Wales, an unregistered charge is ineffective against a later purchaser but may still be enforceable against the borrower personally. |\n| **3. Bank had actual or constructive notice of your equitable interest** | Evidence that the bank **knew** (or ought to have known) that you had a beneficial interest – e.g., you were on the title register, you paid the purchase price, you were a named co‑borrower on the original loan, you received mortgage statements, you were in regular contact with the lender. | If the bank had notice, it loses BFP status and **may be subordinated** to your prior equitable interest.  The court can order the bank to **share the proceeds** or to **delay enforcement** until your claim is resolved. | **Low‑medium** – banks are diligent about checking the register.  However, if the original title listed you as a co‑owner, the bank *should* have known.  Some jurisdictions (e.g., Spain) treat a co‑owner’s “right of habitability” as notice. |\n| **4. Fraud / Misrepresentation by the borrower** | Show that the mortgage was obtained **through fraud** (e.g., your ex forged your signature, misrepresented the ownership structure, or concealed your interest). | A mortgage obtained by fraud can be **voidable** at the instance of the defrauded party (you) and may be set aside, or the court may order the bank to **subordinate** its claim. | **Medium** – you need strong evidence (forged signatures, email trails, sworn statements).  Courts are reluctant to punish the bank for the borrower’s fraud unless the bank was *recklessly* indifferent. |\n| **5. Undue influence / Lack of independent advice** | Prove that the borrower was **unduly influenced** by your ex (e.g., they were in a relationship of trust and the bank failed to ensure independent legal advice). | Some jurisdictions allow a mortgage to be set aside if the borrower was *unduly influenced* and the lender failed to take reasonable steps to verify consent. | **Low** – banks usually require independent legal counsel for large loans; the burden is high. |\n| **6. Statutory protection for “family home”** | In many EU states (e.g., Spain’s *Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil*, France’s *Code civil* art. 2284‑5, Germany’s *BGB* § 1589) a **family home** enjoys special protection; a mortgage taken out without the spouse’s consent may be **void** or **subordinated**. | The bank’s charge may be declared **ineffective** against the protected portion of the home. | **Medium‑high** if the property is your *family home* and you are still legally married or in a civil partnership, or if the jurisdiction treats co‑habitation as a “family home”. |\n| **7. Lender’s “non‑consensual” mortgage (e.g., “second charge” without first‑charge consent)** | Show that the bank **did not obtain a first‑charge consent** from the existing mortgage holder (if any) or from you as a co‑owner. | The second charge may be **subordinate** to the first, but it does **not** automatically disappear.  However, if the first charge is void, the second may also be void. | **Low‑medium** – depends on the chain of charges. |\n\n### How these theories interact with a **constructive‑trust claim**\n\n*Even if you succeed in **nullifying** or **subordinating** the bank’s charge*, the **constructive‑trust** claim still exists.  It will determine **how the equity (if any) is split** between you and your ex once the mortgage (or any other senior charge) is satisfied.\n\nConversely, **if the mortgage survives**, you will still have a **personal claim** against your ex for:\n\n1. **Contribution / accounting** – you can sue for the value of the €180 k you invested (or the proportionate share of the increase in value you created).  \n2. **Unjust enrichment** – the court may order the ex to repay the amount you added to the property.  \n3. **Damages for breach of fiduciary duty / misrepresentation** – if you can prove the ex acted fraudulently.\n\nThe **bank’s priority** does **not** extinguish your **right to sue the ex**; it only means the bank gets paid first out of the sale proceeds.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Practical steps you can take **right now**\n\nBelow is a **check‑list** you can run through with a local solicitor (preferably one who handles both **property law** and **banking/finance** matters).  Tick the items that apply, gather the documents, and discuss the strategy that best fits your jurisdiction.\n\n### A. Gather the documentary evidence\n\n| Document | Why it matters |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Title register / cadastre extract** (showing you as a co‑owner, percentage ownership, any existing charges) | Proves your legal interest and whether the bank *should* have known. |\n| **Mortgage deed (the €200 k loan)** – full copy, including any “mortgagee clause”, date of execution, signatures, and the **registration entry** (if any) | Determines whether the mortgage is valid, who signed, and whether it was registered. |\n| **Correspondence with the bank** (loan application, statements, emails, any notice of the mortgage) | Shows whether the bank asked for your consent or was aware of your interest. |\n| **Evidence of your investment** – invoices, receipts, bank transfers, contractor agreements, before‑and‑after valuations, photos | Needed for a constructive‑trust/ unjust‑enrichment claim and for quantifying your contribution. |\n| **Any co‑habitation or partnership agreement** (e.g., co‑ownership agreement, separation agreement, court orders) | May give you a contractual basis for a share of the equity. |\n| **Communications with your ex** (texts, emails, WhatsApp) that discuss the loan, the renovations, or the intention to keep you involved | Useful to prove you were *not* aware of the loan and that the loan was taken “secretly”. |\n| **Bank’s internal policies** (if obtainable) on consent for mortgages on jointly‑owned property | May help argue that the bank breached its own procedures. |\n| **Proof of marital status / civil partnership** at the time of the loan | Relevant for “family‑home” protection statutes. |\n\n### B. Immediate legal actions\n\n1. **File a **“notice of claim”** (or “pre‑action letter”) against your ex for **constructive trust / contribution**.  \n   *Goal*: Preserve your right to a share of the equity and to recover the €180 k you put in.  \n\n2. **Request a **“court‑ordered freezing order”** (or “injunction”) on the property** if you fear the bank will enforce the mortgage and sell the house before your claim is resolved.  \n   - In many jurisdictions you can ask the court to **stay** any enforcement until the dispute over ownership is settled.  \n   - The court may require you to provide a **security** (e.g., a bank guarantee) to protect the lender’s interest.\n\n3. **Challenge the mortgage’s validity** (see the theories above).  \n   - **If the mortgage is unregistered**: file an application to have it set aside as ineffective against you.  \n   - **If the mortgage was signed without your authority**: lodge a claim for **voidance for lack of consent**.  \n   - **If you have evidence of fraud or forgery**: consider a **civil action for fraud** *and* a **criminal complaint** (for forgery, fraud, or misappropriation).  \n\n4. **Negotiate with the bank** (often the fastest way to protect your equity).  \n   - **Offer a “subordination agreement”**: you agree to let the bank be paid first, but you ask that the bank **recognise your equitable interest** and **grant you a right of first refusal** on any surplus.  \n   - **Propose a “settlement”** where you pay a portion of the €200 k (or a proportionate share) to the bank in exchange for a **release of the charge** on the portion of the property that reflects your contribution.  \n   - **Ask the bank to “re‑mortgage”** the property in your name (or jointly) so that you become a co‑borrower and can protect your stake.  \n\n5. **Consider a “partition” or “sale” action**.  \n   - If the parties cannot agree, you can apply to the court for **partition** (physical division, if possible) or **forced sale**.  \n   - The court will first satisfy the mortgage, then allocate the remainder according to the constructive‑trust percentages.  \n\n6. **Seek a “constructive‑trust declaration”** from the court **before** any sale.  \n   - This is a **pre‑emptive judgment** that says: “You (the claimant) have a 50 % beneficial interest in the property, the ex‑partner has 50 %.”  \n   - Once the court declares the trust, the mortgagee’s charge is still senior, but the **distribution of any surplus** is fixed.  \n\n### C. Parallel civil‑criminal routes\n\n| Route | What it achieves | Typical timeline |\n|-------|------------------|------------------|\n| **Civil fraud claim against the ex** (e.g., misrepresentation, conversion) | May give you a **damages award** that can be used to pay off the mortgage or to claim against the ex’s personal assets. | 12‑24 months (depends on court). |\n| **Criminal complaint for forgery / fraud** | If the bank’s loan documents contain a forged signature, the criminal case can lead to **nullification of the mortgage** and possible restitution. | 6‑18 months for investigation; criminal conviction may take longer. |\n| **Bank‑regulator complaint** (e.g., Financial Conduct Authority in the UK, BaFin in Germany, CNBV in Spain) | If the bank failed to follow statutory safeguards (e.g., didn’t verify co‑owner consent), the regulator may impose sanctions and may **assist** you in negotiating a settlement. | Variable; often used as leverage. |\n\n### D. Financial‑risk mitigation\n\n| Action | Why it matters |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Open a separate “reserve” account** for any proceeds you may receive from the sale (or from a settlement) and keep it **outside the mortgage**. | Shows the court that you are not mixing funds and helps you prove the amount you are owed. |\n| **Obtain a “personal guarantee”** from a third party (e.g., a family member) to secure any settlement you propose to the bank. | May make the bank more willing to **subordinate** its charge. |\n| **Consider a “protective lien”** on any future proceeds (e.g., a judgment lien) against the ex’s personal assets. | Gives you a **fallback** if the property sale leaves you with nothing. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.
