The candidate answer extensively discusses Article V(1)(a) (jurisdiction) and Article V(1)(b) (due process) in response to the prompt's scenario (resistance based on lack of jurisdiction and due process violation). However, it fails to mention or address Article V(1)(e), which deals with the award being set aside in the country of the seat (Paris). Since the scenario involves an injunction from a *different* jurisdiction (India), the relevance of V(1)(e) might seem secondary, but the criterion explicitly tests knowledge of this specific provision in the context of enforcement defenses under Article V. The candidate answer does not mention V(1)(e) at all.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4e27ec7e-c6c3-4702-94e3-c62fdc7b481d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4049, "completion_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 4284}, "latency_s": 1.1592483749845996, "request_id": "Jc2Uaam9Ndy8nsEPjZySgAU", "raw_response": null}
