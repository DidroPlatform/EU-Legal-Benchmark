The candidate answer states that the court acts 'in support of' the arbitration and that the court's role is 'supportive' (Section 1, Section 3(a)). However, the criterion specifically mentions supporting the *Singapore arbitral tribunal*. While the answer discusses supporting the *arbitration* generally under s.44 AA 1996, it does not explicitly frame the support as being directed towards the *Singapore arbitral tribunal* as the primary focus of support, especially when discussing balancing jurisdiction against the seat court/tribunal (Section 3(d)). The answer focuses more on supporting the *process* and avoiding conflict, rather than explicitly stating the approach is to support the *tribunal* itself, which is a subtle but important distinction in this context.\", \"criterion_id\": \"08734068-ea67-432e-afa8-2a3dd386fcce\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1641, "completion_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 1871}, "latency_s": 4.814185166032985, "request_id": "wBmVaf_9I8jl7M8P9OOViAY", "raw_response": null}
