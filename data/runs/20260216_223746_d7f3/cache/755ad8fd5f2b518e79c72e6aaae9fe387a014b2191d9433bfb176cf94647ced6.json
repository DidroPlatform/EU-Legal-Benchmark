Acuff-Rose*) protects parody even of commercial works if it comments on the original\n  - **Transformative use**: The worker's advocate version might qualify as transformative commentary\n  - The \"sunglasses\" version is harder to defend—it's closer to a knockoff than commentary\n\n### Trademark\n- If your client has registered the character as a trademark (or it has acquired secondary meaning), dilution claims are possible under the Lanham Act\n- Likelihood of confusion standard applies\n\n### Practical Advantages\n- US courts move faster than Italian courts\n- Statutory damages available ($750–$30,000 per work; up to $150,000 for willful infringement)\n- Attorney's fees recoverable if infringement is willful\n- DMCA takedown notices work against online sellers\n\n### Fair Use Complications\nThe parody/commentary versions are genuinely risky for your client in the US. A court might find:\n- The worker's advocate shirt comments on labor movements, not the cartoon itself → fair use\n- The mocking version comments on the show's humor → fair use\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**For Italy:**\n- Prioritize identifying the manufacturer/distributor (not just street vendors)\n- Hire Italian IP counsel to send formal notice\n- Consider EU trademark registration if not done\n- Weigh cost-benefit; street vendors may not be worth pursuing\n\n**For the US:**\n- Register the character as a trademark if not already done\n- Document the infringement carefully\n- Be cautious about pursuing the parody/commentary versions—fair use is a real defense\n- Focus on the \"sunglasses\" version as straightforward knockoff\n\nWould your client like guidance on trademark registration strategy?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 166, "completion_tokens": 754, "total_tokens": 920}, "latency_s": 8.940068124997197, "request_id": "chatcmpl-53711cba-8493-434f-8511-3d731273f9b1", "raw_response": null}
