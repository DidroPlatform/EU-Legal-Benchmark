It details the two-lane system (Green Lane/Red Lane) and clearly states that under the Windsor Framework, for goods moving via the Green Lane from GB to NI by a trusted trader, the presumption is reversed: goods are presumed NOT to be at risk of entering the EU single market, shifting the burden of proof onto the authorities to demonstrate risk, rather than the trader proving safety. This directly explains how the protection of the EU market was intended to be achieved via the 'at risk' concept.\", \"criterion_id\": \"180fd671-ce28-4f9a-a704-b66b61a7b661\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4180, "completion_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 4361}, "latency_s": 0.8591655000054743, "request_id": "wcSUabj5L9GxnsEPuvytyAM", "raw_response": null}
