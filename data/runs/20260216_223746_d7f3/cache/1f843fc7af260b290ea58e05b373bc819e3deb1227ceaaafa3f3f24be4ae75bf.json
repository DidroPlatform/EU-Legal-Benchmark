The candidate answer focuses heavily on criminal liability (where shared liability via percentages is less common than in civil law) and concludes the truck driver is 'Unlikely liable' and the drunk driver bears 'primary liability'. It does not discuss the possibility of shared liability between the truck driver and the drunk driver, especially in a way that suggests apportionment of fault as implied by the criterion (which often points towards civil liability concepts or joint enterprise in criminal law, though the latter is not applicable here). The analysis does not address the sharing of liability between these two parties.\", \"criterion_id\": \"dda864ac-b922-4cbc-89f6-414a89bd03ed\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1128, "completion_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 1334}, "latency_s": 1.1165774579858407, "request_id": "2OCUabHXMoO2xN8P9c6FqA8", "raw_response": null}
