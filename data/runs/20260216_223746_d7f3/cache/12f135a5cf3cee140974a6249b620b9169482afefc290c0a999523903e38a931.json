The candidate answer states: \\\"For goods coming from third countries (like China), they would be subject to the same rules as goods coming from Great Britain. If they are imported into Northern Ireland and are at risk of entering the EU's single market, they would be subject to checks and controls to ensure they comply with EU rules.\\\" This implies checks based on risk of entry into the EU, not a blanket requirement that *all* goods from third countries entering NI must meet EU standards, which is the core of the criterion (especially concerning goods staying in NI). The framework distinguishes between 'green lane' (low risk, minimal checks, presumed EU compliant) and 'red lane' (high risk, full checks, presumed EU non-compliant if not proven otherwise, or if destined for the EU). The response does not explicitly state the requirement for *all* goods from third countries entering NI to meet EU standards, which is a key aspect of the post-Windsor Framework arrangement for goods entering NI directly from third countries (they are subject to EU rules if they are to remain in NI, or if they are at risk of moving to the EU). The response focuses too much on the 'risk of entering the EU' rather than the compliance standard for goods staying in NI.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e4a1ae1b-a58e-4d31-bec4-4cf261c4a1c4\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1288, "completion_tokens": 339, "total_tokens": 1627}, "latency_s": 1.7936429170076735, "request_id": "ERKVaY_OIYa8xN8Puu-IoAo", "raw_response": null}
