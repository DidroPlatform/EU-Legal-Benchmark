The candidate answer explicitly addresses the civil liability risk, noting potential verdicts of \\u00a3100M+ and focusing on mitigation strategies like settlement funds and technical defenses, but it does not mention or apply any specific punitive damages ratio limit (like a single-digit multiplier). In fact, by focusing on the UK context (mentioning HMRC, DPA precedents, and the principle of full compensation implicitly by discussing restoration to the original position via settlement), the response avoids the error described in the criterion.
