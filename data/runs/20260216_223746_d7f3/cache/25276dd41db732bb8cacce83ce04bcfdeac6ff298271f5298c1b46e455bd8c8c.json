{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 1, \"reasoning\": \"The candidate answer explicitly lists fundamental English tenant obligations that the tenant must prove they fulfilled. Specifically, under section 1.B, it mentions 'Rent Payments' (paying rent on time) and 'Compliance with Tenancy Terms' (which covers general obligations like not having pets if prohibited). While it doesn't list three distinct obligations in a single bullet point, the context of proving compliance inherently requires addressing the core obligations. The prompt itself mentions 'always paid my rent on time and fulfilled my tenant obligations.' The candidate answer covers paying rent, taking care of the property (implied by evidence like photos/inventory reports), and adhering to specific rules (like no pets/subletting). The core obligation of 'taking reasonable care of the property' is strongly implied by the request for 'Photos/videos of the property' and 'inventory reports' as evidence to counter claims about property condition. The obligation to allow access for repairs with notice is covered under 'Communication with Landlord' and the general context of tenancy compliance. Since paying rent is explicitly mentioned, and compliance with other rules (like property condition/rules) is required for evidence gathering, at least three fundamental obligations are addressed.\", \"criterion_id\": \"6488c186-efa8-4d9d-84a7-e426c86d5f92\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2049, "completion_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 2340}, "latency_s": 1.170267999987118, "request_id": "EP6UaYuDFJnqkdUP57jkuQo", "raw_response": null}
