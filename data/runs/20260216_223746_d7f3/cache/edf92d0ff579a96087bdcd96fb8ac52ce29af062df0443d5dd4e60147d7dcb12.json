The candidate answer discusses the foreseeability of the drunk driver's reaction and the culpability of the intoxication, but it does not explicitly link the duration the chair was in the road (visibility/opportunity to avoid) to the legal analysis of whether the swerving constituted a *novus actus interveniens* for the truck driver. It mentions 'opportunity to avoid' generally in section 2(B) regarding the truck driver's liability, but not specifically in the context of assessing the drunk driver's reaction as an intervening cause.\", \"criterion_id\": \"53430ddb-2da1-464a-af19-ff799ad6064e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1808, "completion_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 2027}, "latency_s": 0.7982310830266215, "request_id": "qR6VaZS8LdqgkdUPg_fLkAM", "raw_response": null}
