The candidate answer focuses almost entirely on Article V (grounds for refusal of enforcement) and the FAA. While Article II(3) (which mandates recognition of arbitration agreements) is mentioned in the context of *Kompetenz-Kompetenz*, the response does not explicitly frame Article II as a primary argument for *resisting* the enforcement challenge based on the duty to recognize the agreement itself, which is the core of the criterion's focus. The arguments presented are primarily defenses against Article V challenges, not affirmative reliance on Article II to defeat the challenge.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8ff30d78-acbb-408c-9669-f016cc43474e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3387, "completion_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 3577}, "latency_s": 0.8993015419691801, "request_id": "hvqUad2mEJnqkdUP57jkuQo", "raw_response": null}
