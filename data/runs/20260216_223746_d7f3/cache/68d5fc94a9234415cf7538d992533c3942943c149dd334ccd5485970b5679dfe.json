The candidate response proposes setting up a 'UK Import-Facilitator' entity which acts as the IOR. It mentions that this UK entity registers for VAT, pays import VAT, and then reclaims it or passes it to the US buyer under a 'reverse-charge arrangement' (Section 2.2, VAT registration). While it discusses VAT handling, it does not explicitly state the necessity of a *separate, back-to-back sales contract* between the French parent and the UK facilitator (or between the UK facilitator and the US buyer) specifically to manage the VAT liability flow and avoid double taxation, which is the core requirement of the criterion. The closest mention is the 'Supply & Delivery Agreement' (Section 5.2.2), but this focuses on reimbursement and indemnity, not the specific contractual structure needed to manage the VAT implications of the IOR role.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2941285f-f638-4e87-9944-0cebd24bc52b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4573, "completion_tokens": 261, "total_tokens": 4834}, "latency_s": 1.1319171670475043, "request_id": "PumUaYGmCM2Lxs0Pm8GNoA8", "raw_response": null}
