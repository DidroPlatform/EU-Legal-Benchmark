The candidate answer discusses Article V(1)(b) (due process) extensively and mentions Article V(1)(e) only in a sub-bullet point under 'Practical Vulnerabilities to Address' where it incorrectly conflates it with grounds like corruption/fraud, stating: \\\"Article V(1)(e) permits non-enforcement for 'corruption, fraud or bribery'\\\". This is factually incorrect; corruption/fraud is V(1)(c), and V(1)(e) relates to the award being set aside or suspended in the seat country.
