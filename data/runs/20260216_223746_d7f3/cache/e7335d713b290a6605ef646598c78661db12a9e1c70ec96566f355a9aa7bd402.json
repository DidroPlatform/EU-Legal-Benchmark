Section 5, specifically under the heading 'What about third countries (e.g., China \\u2192 NI directly)?', explains this: 'If the goods are imported into NI and are capable of onward movement into Ireland/EU, the authorities will treat them under the at-risk logic unless the importer can place them into an approved \\u201cNI-destined\\u201d route with the required assurances.' This aligns with the concept that if the NI destination is proven (i.e., they qualify for the Green Lane), they are subject to the UK internal market regime (which uses the UK tariff rate, not the EU tariff rate, for NI consumption). The response clearly addresses the burden of proof for NI destination and the resulting treatment.\", \"criterion_id\": \"31ba07bc-6e8b-4a21-b24c-b747c1641530\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4113, "completion_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 4366}, "latency_s": 0.9312611669884063, "request_id": "yiCVaaWjNYDHnsEPq_XX6Qg", "raw_response": null}
