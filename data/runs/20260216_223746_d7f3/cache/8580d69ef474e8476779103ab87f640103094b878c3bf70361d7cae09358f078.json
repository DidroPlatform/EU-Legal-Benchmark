The candidate answer explicitly addresses the unworkability of the original Protocol by detailing the core problem: the need for controls to prevent leakage across the land border (which necessitated customs infrastructure and complex sifting mechanisms). It explains the 'at risk' mechanism (JC Decision 4/2020) as the unworkable element that Windsor sought to fix via Green/Red lanes. It also directly addresses the political turmoil by explaining the Stormont Brake as a response to the democratic deficit caused by applying EU law without NI consent, which was the core of the DUP boycott. The answer clearly covers the required factors (infrastructure/controls, unworkable 'at risk' sifting, and political turmoil) in its explanation of the transition from the Protocol to the Framework.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2826ef22-06a3-46de-8eb3-18cf74e9e1ed\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4154, "completion_tokens": 255, "total_tokens": 4409}, "latency_s": 1.1440744589781389, "request_id": "dSCVaYXSNKnw7M8Pu5DvyAM", "raw_response": null}
