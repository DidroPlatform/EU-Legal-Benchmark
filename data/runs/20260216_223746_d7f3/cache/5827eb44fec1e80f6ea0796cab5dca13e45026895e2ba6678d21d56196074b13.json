Factual Causation: The \"But For\" Test\n\nThe starting point is *R v White* [1910]: but for the defendant's act, would the harm have occurred?\n\n### The Truck Driver\n- But for the chair falling from the truck, the chain of events would not have begun. The chair on the roadway is the initial factual cause.\n\n### The Drunk Driver\n- But for the drunk driver swerving into the second car, the occupant of that car would not have been injured. His act is also a factual \"but for\" cause.\n\nBoth actors satisfy the factual causation test. However, factual causation alone is never sufficient — the law must also attribute **legal** responsibility.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Legal Causation\n\nLegal causation requires that the defendant's act was a **more than minimal** (or more than *de minimis*) cause of the result, and that there was no **novus actus interveniens** (new intervening act) sufficient to break the chain of causation.\n\nKey principles:\n\n- The defendant's act need not be the **sole** or even the **main** cause — it must simply be a **significant** (more than negligible) contribution (*R v Pagett* [1983]; *R v Kimsey* [1996]).\n- The \"thin skull\" rule and the principle that defendants must **take their victims as they find them** (*R v Blaue* [1975]) — though this is more relevant to victim characteristics than third-party intervention.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Analysing the Truck Driver's Liability\n\n### (a) The act\nThe truck driver allowed an insecure chair to fall onto a freeway. This is the originating act.\n\n### (b) Was the drunk driver's intervention a *novus actus interveniens*?\n\nThis is the critical question. The courts consider whether the intervening act was:\n\n- **Reasonably foreseeable**, or\n- **Free, deliberate, and informed** (the test from *R v Kennedy (No 2)* [2007] and *R v Pagett*).\n\n#### Foreseeability\nUnder *R v Roberts* [1971] and *R v Marjoram* [2000], the question is whether the reaction of the third party was **reasonably foreseeable** — not whether the precise manner of harm was foreseeable, but whether the general type of response was within the range of foreseeable reactions.\n\n- A driver swerving to avoid an obstacle on a freeway is an **entirely foreseeable** reaction. Drivers routinely swerve to avoid debris. That the swerve caused a collision with another vehicle is a foreseeable consequence of an obstruction on a high-speed road.\n- The fact that the driver happened to be drunk does not necessarily break the chain if the **type of reaction** (swerving) was foreseeable, even if the **severity** of the reaction was exacerbated by intoxication.\n\nHowever, there is a strong counter-argument:\n\n#### The \"Free, Deliberate, and Informed\" Act Doctrine\nIn *R v Kennedy (No 2)* [2007], the House of Lords held that the **free, deliberate, and informed** act of a third party will generally break the chain of causation. The drunk driver made a **voluntary decision** to swerve (albeit impaired). One could argue this was a free and deliberate act.\n\n**But** the courts have consistently distinguished between:\n- A truly **voluntary** intervening act (e.g., a person independently choosing to inject themselves with drugs — *Kennedy*), and\n- A **reactive** act that is a **response to the danger created by the defendant** (*Roberts*, *Marjoram*, *Pagett*).\n\nSwerving to avoid a chair is a **reactive** response to the danger created by the truck driver. It is not a calm, independent, autonomous decision. Even a drunk driver's swerve is a **reflexive response** to the hazard. The courts are likely to treat this as falling within the *Roberts*/*Marjoram* line of authority rather than the *Kennedy* line.\n\n#### The Intoxication Complication\nThe drunk driver's intoxication is a complicating factor. One might argue:\n\n- A **sober** driver might have braked or manoeuvred more carefully, avoiding the collision entirely.\n- The **excessive** nature of the swerve (crashing into another car) was caused not by the chair alone but by the **impairment** of the drunk driver.\n\nThe prosecution of the truck driver would need to show that the drunk driver's reaction was **within the range of foreseeable responses**. The courts have generally held that defendants must anticipate that not all people will react perfectly — *R v Roberts* held that only a response that was **\"daft\"** or so unexpected as to be unforeseeable would break the chain.\n\nA drunk driver swerving erratically on a freeway is arguably **not unforeseeable** — the truck driver must take the world as it is, including the possibility that other road users may be impaired, tired, or otherwise not driving optimally. The presence of impaired drivers on roads is, sadly, a **statistically foreseeable** reality.\n\n**Likely conclusion on the truck driver**: The chain of causation is **probably not broken**. The drunk driver's swerve was a foreseeable (if exaggerated) response to the hazard. The truck driver's act remains a **more than minimal cause** of the serious injury. However, this is not beyond argument — a defence counsel would vigorously contend that the drunk driving was an overwhelming supervening cause.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Analysing the Drunk Driver's Liability\n\nThe causation analysis for the drunk driver is more straightforward:\n\n- **Factual causation**: But for the drunk driver swerving into the second car, the injury would not have occurred. ✓\n- **Legal causation**: The drunk driver's act was a **direct and immediate** cause of the collision and the serious injury. There is no intervening act between his swerve and the crash. His act was clearly **more than minimal**. ✓\n- **No novus actus**: Nothing intervenes between his swerve and the harm.\n\nThe drunk driver clearly **caused** the injury in both the factual and legal sense.\n\n### Potential offences\n- **Causing serious injury by dangerous driving** (s.1A Road Traffic Act 1988, as amended)\n- **Dangerous driving** (s.2 RTA 1988)\n- Potentially **causing serious injury by careless driving when under the influence of drink** (s.2C RTA 1988)\n- If the victim died: **causing death by dangerous driving** (s.1 RTA 1988) or **causing death by careless driving when under the influence** (s.3A RTA 1988)\n\nThe drunk driver might argue the chair was a **novus actus** that caused *him* to swerve, but this would fail — the chair did not **compel** him to crash into another car. His impaired state and his manner of driving are the operative legal causes. The chair provides **context** but does not excuse or break the chain from his perspective.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Multiple Concurrent Causes\n\nUK law comfortably accommodates **multiple concurrent causes**. Per *R v Benge* (1865) and the modern restatement in *R v Kimsey* [1996], there can be **more than one legal cause** of a result. The truck driver and the drunk driver can **both** be legal causes of the serious injury.\n\nThis is not a situation where one must choose — the law permits (and frequently finds) that **both** actors in a chain bear causal responsibility, each assessed independently.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summary Table\n\n| Issue | Truck Driver | Drunk Driver |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Factual cause (\"but for\")** | Yes — chair created the hazard | Yes — swerve caused the collision |\n| **Legal cause (more than minimal)** | Likely yes — created the dangerous condition | Clearly yes — direct and immediate cause |\n| **Novus actus by drunk driver?** | Probably not — swerving was a foreseeable (if impaired) reaction to the hazard (*Roberts*/*Marjoram*) | N/A |\n| **Novus actus by chair?** | N/A | No — the chair did not compel the manner of driving |\n| **Overall causation established?** | **Probably yes**, though arguable | **Yes**, clearly |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Key Authorities Summary\n\n| Case | Principle |\n|---|---|\n| *R v White* [1910] | \"But for\" test for factual causation |\n| *R v Pagett* [1983] | Defendant's act need not be sole cause; reasonable actions of third parties do not break the chain |\n| *R v Roberts* [1971] | Foreseeable reactions to defendant's act do not break the chain; only \"daft\" responses do |\n| *R v Marjoram* [2000] | Foreseeable reactive conduct does not constitute a novus actus |\n| *R v Kennedy (No 2)* [2007] | A free, deliberate, and informed act of a third party *can* break the chain |\n| *R v Kimsey* [1996] | The defendant's act need only be a \"more than slight or trifling\" cause |\n| *R v Benge* (1865) | Multiple causes can co-exist; contributory negligence of others does not negate causation |\n| *R v Blaue* [1975] | Take your victim as you find them |\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder UK criminal law, **both the truck driver and the drunk driver** likely satisfy the causation requirements for the serious injury to the occupant of the second car. The drunk driver's causation is clear and direct. The truck driver's causation is **more contestable** but likely survives analysis — the drunk driver's swerve, while exacerbated by intoxication, was a **foreseeable type of reaction** to a hazard on a high-speed road and is unlikely to be treated as a *novus actus interveniens* sufficient to break the chain. The intoxication of the intervening driver is the strongest argument for the truck driver's defence, but the weight of authority suggests that imperfect or even impaired reactions to a defendant's dangerous act remain within the scope of foreseeable consequences.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 91, "completion_tokens": 2474, "total_tokens": 2565}, "latency_s": 49.35595162498066, "request_id": "chatcmpl-6a9f1460-332f-4c50-bf4c-9dd235238173", "raw_response": null}
