While the response discusses supporting the arbitration under s.44 AA 1996 and mentions deferring to the tribunal, its primary focus is on when the court *can* grant an injunction despite the arbitration (urgency, inability of the tribunal, asset preservation). The conclusion states the court will 'prioritise the arbitration agreement' but then lists exceptions where it *will* grant relief. It does not clearly state that the *approach* is to support the tribunal as the primary guiding principle over granting the injunction itself, especially when the injunction is sought *against* a party subject to foreign arbitration. The response leans more towards explaining the conditions under which the injunction stands, rather than explicitly confirming the court's primary stance is support for the tribunal over the injunction.\", \"criterion_id\": \"08734068-ea67-432e-afa8-2a3dd386fcce\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2779, "completion_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 3005}, "latency_s": 1.3116260000388138, "request_id": "SPqUadTsK6L17M8Pt6zc8AU", "raw_response": null}
