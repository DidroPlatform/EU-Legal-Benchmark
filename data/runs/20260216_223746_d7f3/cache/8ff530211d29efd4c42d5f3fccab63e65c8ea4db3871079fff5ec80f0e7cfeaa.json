The candidate answer discusses the legal situation extensively but does not perform the required calculation. The total debt against the property, based on the hypothetical figures in the criterion, would be \\u00a3300,000 + \\u00a3200,000 = \\u00a3500,000. To recover \\u00a3180,000, the sale price would need to exceed \\u00a3500,000 (assuming the user's claim ranks first, which the answer notes is unlikely). If the user's claim ranks second (the most likely scenario discussed), the sale price must exceed \\u00a3500,000 for the user to recover anything after the bank is paid.
