The retailer was your shield — they handled importation, bore the customs liability, managed VAT, and insulated your French parent from direct HMRC exposure. That shield is gone. Their new US parent's legal team is rational from their perspective: Ex Works shifts every gram of risk onto you.\n\nYou now have **four simultaneous crises**, not one:\n\n1. **No Importer of Record** — you cannot legally import into the UK without one\n2. **VAT exposure** — a non-UK entity importing goods triggers immediate registration and cash flow obligations\n3. **Origin integrity risk** — mixed refrigerant classifications could contaminate your entire container's preferential treatment\n4. **Liability exposure** — your French parent becomes directly visible to HMRC as the declarant\n\nHere is how to solve all four.\n\n---\n\n## CRISIS 1: THE IMPORTER OF RECORD PROBLEM\n\n### Why You Cannot Simply \"Be\" the IOR\n\nUnder UK customs law (Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 and the Customs (Import Duty) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018), the importer of record bears full legal liability for:\n\n- Accuracy of the customs declaration\n- Payment of duties and import VAT\n- Compliance with product safety regulations (UKCA marking, F-gas)\n- Post-clearance audits going back **three years**\n\nA French-registered entity **can** technically be the IOR — HMRC does not strictly require UK establishment for importation. But doing so means your French parent's balance sheet is directly exposed to HMRC enforcement, including penalties, seizure orders, and post-clearance duty demands. This is exactly what you need to avoid.\n\n### The Three Structural Options\n\n**Option A: Establish a UK Subsidiary (Medium-Term Solution)**\n\nRegister a UK limited company as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the French parent. This entity becomes your permanent IOR, holds the UK VAT registration, and creates a clean legal firewall.\n\n- **Timeline**: 4-8 weeks for incorporation, VAT registration, EORI number, and customs setup\n- **Cost**: £5,000-£15,000 setup, plus ongoing compliance (~£20,000-£30,000/year for accounting, filings, registered office)\n- **Advantage**: Complete structural insulation; the French parent is a shareholder, not a declarant\n- **Disadvantage**: Too slow for your immediate shipment\n\n**Option B: Appoint a Fiscal Representative / Indirect Representative (Immediate Solution)**\n\nUnder the Union Customs Code legacy provisions as adopted into UK law, and specifically under **Section 21 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018**, a customs agent can act as either a **direct representative** (acting in your name, on your behalf — you remain liable) or an **indirect representative** (acting in their own name, on your behalf — they become jointly liable).\n\nWhat you actually want is a **third-party IOR service provider**. Several UK-based firms (Customs Support Group, Landmark Global, Flexport's UK arm, among others) will act as your Importer of Record under a commercial agreement. They become the named importer on the customs declaration. You indemnify them contractually, but the critical point is: **HMRC's direct enforcement target is the UK entity, not your French parent.**\n\n- **Timeline**: 5-10 business days to onboard\n- **Cost**: Per-shipment fees (typically £500-£2,000 per entry) plus a percentage of duty/VAT as a risk premium\n- **Advantage**: Immediate; no UK entity required; structural insulation achieved\n- **Disadvantage**: Ongoing cost; you're dependent on a third party; they will require robust indemnification\n\n**Option C: Negotiate DAP Instead of Ex Works**\n\nBefore accepting Ex Works, push back. The US conglomerate's legal team said Ex Works, but there is a middle ground. Under **DAP (Delivered at Place)**, you handle transport to the UK destination but the **buyer remains the importer of record and handles customs clearance**. This is materially different from Ex Works (where you have zero obligation past your factory gate) but also different from DDP (where you handle everything including duties).\n\nUnder DAP, the buyer's obligation to clear customs is explicit in the Incoterms® 2020 rules. Their legal team may accept this because it still shifts transport risk to you during transit, which is likely their actual concern — not the customs clearance itself.\n\n### My Recommendation\n\n**Immediate (this shipment):** Option B — engage a third-party IOR service provider. Get them onboarded now.\n\n**Parallel negotiation:** Option C — go back to the retailer with DAP as a counter-proposal. Frame it as: \"Your legal team wants to avoid transport risk. DAP gives you that. But customs clearance remains with the party that has the UK infrastructure to handle it — you.\"\n\n**Medium-term (next 90 days):** Option A — incorporate a UK subsidiary. Once operational, transition the IOR role to your own entity and terminate the third-party IOR arrangement.\n\n---\n\n## CRISIS 2: THE VAT EXPOSURE\n\n### The Mechanism\n\nWhen goods are imported into the UK, **import VAT at 20%** is due at the point of customs clearance. This is separate from and in addition to any customs duty.\n\nIf your French parent is the importer (or a third-party IOR acts on your behalf), someone must account for this VAT. The options:\n\n**Postponed VAT Accounting (PVA)**\n\nSince January 2021, the UK allows **Postponed VAT Accounting** under Section 15 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (as amended). Instead of paying import VAT at the border and then reclaiming it on your VAT return (a cash flow nightmare), PVA allows you to account for import VAT on your VAT return — simultaneously declaring it as output tax and reclaiming it as input tax. **Net cash impact: zero.**\n\nBut here's the catch: **you need a UK VAT registration to use PVA.**\n\n### The Path Forward\n\n- If you use a **third-party IOR** (Option B above), they can use their own VAT registration and PVA. The import VAT flows through their books. You reimburse them, and the cost is built into their service fee. This is standard practice.\n- If you establish a **UK subsidiary** (Option A), that entity registers for VAT (which takes 2-4 weeks via the online portal, or can be expedited) and uses PVA directly.\n- If you somehow end up as the direct importer without a UK entity, you must register for UK VAT as a **Non-Established Taxable Person (NETP)**. This is possible but creates ongoing UK filing obligations for your French parent — exactly the entanglement you want to avoid.\n\n### Critical Warning\n\nDo **not** let your freight forwarder handle VAT informally or \"absorb\" it into their charges without a clear legal structure. HMRC audits of import VAT have intensified post-Brexit, and any mismatch between the declared importer, the VAT registration used, and the entity actually paying will trigger scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n## CRISIS 3: THE ORIGIN PROBLEM — THIS IS WHERE IT GETS TECHNICAL\n\n### The Underlying Issue\n\nYou have two models in one container:\n\n| | Lyon Model | Alpine Model |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Refrigerant** | R32 | R454B |\n| **HS Classification** | Almost certainly 8415.10 (self-contained window/wall units) or 8415.83 (not incorporating a refrigerating unit) — depends on configuration | Same HS heading, but... |\n| **Origin concern** | Manufactured in France, straightforward EU origin | R454B is a Honeywell-patented blend (R32/R1234yf). If the R1234yf component is sourced from outside the EU, the origin calculation changes |\n\n### Why This Matters Under TCA Rules of Origin\n\nThe UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) provides for **zero-tariff, zero-quota** trade, but only if goods qualify as \"originating\" under the TCA's rules of origin (Title I, Heading Two, Chapter 2 of the TCA, and specifically Annex ORIG-2 for product-specific rules).\n\nFor HS Chapter 84 products, the product-specific rule typically requires either:\n\n- **Change of tariff heading (CTH)**: all non-originating materials must be classified under a different 4-digit HS heading than the finished product, OR\n- **Value threshold**: the value of non-originating materials does not exceed a specified percentage (often 50%) of the ex-works price of the product\n\nHere is the critical question: **Where does the R454B refrigerant come from, and what is its value relative to the finished unit?**\n\nR454B is a blend of approximately 68.9% R32 and 31.1% R1234yf (HFO-1234yf). R1234yf is primarily manufactured by:\n- Honeywell (US production facilities)\n- Chemours (US)\n- Some licensed production in Japan and increasingly in the EU\n\nIf your R454B is **pre-blended in the EU** by a European supplier (e.g., from Honeywell's EU operations or a licensed EU blender), and the blending constitutes sufficient processing, the refrigerant may qualify as EU-originating.\n\nIf the R454B is **imported pre-blended from the US**, it is non-originating material. You then need to check whether:\n\n1. The refrigerant falls under a different HS heading than the finished air conditioning unit (it does — refrigerants are classified under HS 2903 for HFCs or 3824.78 for mixtures; your finished product is HS 8415). So a **CTH rule is satisfied** even with US-origin refrigerant.\n\n2. Even if CTH is satisfied, you must check for any **tolerances or exclusions** in the product-specific rules for 8415.\n\n### The Mixed Container Problem\n\nYour freight forwarder's concern about a \"mixed consignment origin claim\" reflects a real but **manageable** issue. Here's the precise mechanism:\n\nUnder the TCA, origin is determined **per product**, not per shipment. A single container can contain products with different origin statuses. The origin declaration (which under the TCA is a **Statement on Origin** made by the exporter, not a certificate issued by a chamber of commerce) is made per product or per invoice.\n\n**You do not need a single unified origin claim for the entire container.** This is a common misconception.\n\nWhat you need:\n\n1. **Separate commercial invoices** (or clearly separated line items on one invoice) for the Lyon models and Alpine models\n2. **Separate Statements on Origin** for each product type, or a single Statement on Origin that covers both but specifies the products it applies to\n3. **Separate origin substantiation files** for each model, held at your premises in France, available for verification for **four years** after the Statement on Origin is made (per Article ORIG.22 of the TCA)\n\n### Should You Split Into Two Customs Entries?\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n| Factor | Single Entry | Two Entries |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Customs broker fees** | One entry fee (~£150-£350) | Two entry fees |\n| **Origin risk** | If one product's origin is challenged, HMRC may scrutinize the entire entry | Clean separation; a challenge on Alpine doesn't contaminate Lyon |\n| **Practical complexity** | One set of paperwork, one release | Two declarations, potentially two different release timings |\n| **VAT treatment** | Identical either way | Identical either way |\n| **Duty treatment** | If both qualify under TCA, both are zero-rate regardless | Same |\n| **Risk of rejection** | If the Alpine's origin claim fails, the entire entry could be held pending resolution, **delaying release of the Lyon units too** | Lyon units clear independently |\n\n### My Recommendation on Splitting\n\n**Split the customs entries.** Yes, it doubles the broker fees — an additional £150-£350 is trivial compared to the cost of 70 Lyon units being held at the port because HMRC wants to verify the R454B origin claim on 30 Alpine units.\n\nBut more importantly: **substantiate the Alpine's origin claim before it ships.** Specifically:\n\n1. **Get a supplier declaration** from your R454B supplier confirming the origin of the refrigerant and its components. If they are an EU supplier, request a **Supplier's Declaration for products having preferential origin status** in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447 (which, while an EU regulation, is the basis for the documentation your French entity should hold).\n\n2. **Run the origin calculation** for the Alpine model. Document the ex-works price, the value and origin of every non-originating input, and confirm that the product-specific rule for HS 8415 is met. Keep this file meticulously — it is your defense in a verification.\n\n3. **If the Alpine does NOT qualify for TCA preferential origin**, you have two choices:\n   - Ship it anyway and pay the MFN duty rate (which for HS 8415 products imported into the UK is currently **2.2% to 2.7%** depending on the specific subheading — not catastrophic)\n   - Reformulate your supply chain so the R454B is sourced from an EU-origin supplier\n\n---\n\n## CRISIS 4: STRUCTURAL INSULATION OF THE FRENCH PARENT\n\n### The Architecture\n\nHere is the target structure, implemented in phases:\n\n```\nPHASE 1 (Immediate — This Shipment)\n=====================================\n\nFrench Parent Company (Manufacturer)\n         |\n         | Sells Ex Works (per retailer's demand)\n         |\n         v\nThird-Party UK IOR Service Provider\n         |\n         | Acts as Importer of Record\n         | Uses own EORI and VAT registration\n         | Clears goods through HMRC\n         | Uses Postponed VAT Accounting\n         |\n         v\nUK Retailer (now US-owned)\n         |\n         | Buys from French Parent (commercial relationship)\n         | Receives goods post-clearance\n         | IOR service is a pass-through cost billed to French Parent\n\nLegal flow: French Parent → sells goods → UK Retailer\nCustoms flow: Third-Party IOR → declares to HMRC → releases goods\nLiability: IOR bears primary customs liability (indemnified by French Parent contractually)\nFrench Parent exposure to HMRC: Minimal — not named as declarant\n```\n\n```\nPHASE 2 (90 Days — Permanent Structure)\n========================================\n\nFrench Parent Company\n         |\n         | 100% ownership\n         |\n         v\nUK Subsidiary (Ltd)\n         |\n         | Registered with Companies House\n         | Has own EORI number\n         | UK VAT registered (using PVA)\n         | Acts as Importer of Record\n         | May also act as UK distributor\n         |\n         v\nUK Retailer + Other UK Customers\n         |\n\nCommercial options:\n  A) French Parent sells to UK Sub (transfer pricing applies),\n     UK Sub sells to retailer — UK Sub is both IOR and reseller\n  B) French Parent sells directly to retailer,\n     UK Sub acts only as IOR/customs agent — simpler but less\n     commercial flexibility\n```\n\n### Transfer Pricing Warning\n\nIf you go with Option A in Phase 2 (French Parent sells to UK Sub, UK Sub resells), you are creating an intra-group transaction that must comply with **OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines** and both French and UK domestic transfer pricing rules. The price between the French parent and UK subsidiary must be at arm's length. HMRC and the French tax authorities (DGFiP) will both scrutinize this. Budget for transfer pricing documentation from day one.\n\n---\n\n## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN\n\n### This Week\n\n| Priority | Action | Owner | Deadline |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Engage a third-party IOR service provider.
