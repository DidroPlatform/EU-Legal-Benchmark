The candidate answer mentions *R v Keane* but misrepresents its core principle in the context of the facts provided. The facts state the client struck the victim *after* the victim attacked him (retaliation/response to the initial attack). The *Keane* principle, particularly in the context of initial aggressors or those who provoke an attack, relates to whether the initial aggressor can claim self-defence when responding to the victim's subsequent (and potentially lawful) use of force. The prompt's facts suggest the client claims self-defence against the victim's *first* attack. The candidate answer incorrectly frames the *Keane* application as relating to the victim's 'retaliation' being disproportionate to the client's *initial* attack, which doesn't align with the specific application required by the criterion based on the facts (client claims self-defence against the victim's first attack). Furthermore, the candidate's description of *R v Keane* is generic: \\\"This case confirmed that the test for self-defense is whether the defendant honestly believed that the force used was necessary and reasonable in the circumstances.\\\" This is not the specific application required by the criterion regarding disproportionate retaliation reviving the right to self-defence.\", \"criterion_id\": \"653cb3de-b54e-4fad-a0f4-e0a95a9f150d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1457, "completion_tokens": 359, "total_tokens": 1816}, "latency_s": 1.4611919169547036, "request_id": "NgaVabChFK7pnsEP2M6v6QU", "raw_response": null}
