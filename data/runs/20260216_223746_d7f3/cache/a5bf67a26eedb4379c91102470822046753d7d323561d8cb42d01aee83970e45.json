The candidate answer discusses intervening acts breaking the chain (e.g., the drunk driver's swerve and the truck driver's emergency response) potentially relieving the truck owner of liability. However, it fails to explicitly state the principle that the *initial act* (the chair falling) is superseded by the subsequent acts, which is the core concept of *novus actus interveniens* breaking the chain regarding the initial cause. Instead, it focuses on whether the subsequent acts break the chain originating from the truck owner's negligence, rather than stating the general rule that the initial act is superseded.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a9079b34-fa4a-4ba6-ab1d-a638762f1067\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1128, "completion_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 1336}, "latency_s": 0.8737968750065193, "request_id": "uuCUabGQMN6MvdIPivHCkQI", "raw_response": null}
