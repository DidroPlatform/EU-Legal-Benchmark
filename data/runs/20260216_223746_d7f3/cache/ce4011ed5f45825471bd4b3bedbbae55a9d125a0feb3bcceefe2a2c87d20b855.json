Preliminary Remarks\n\nThis question concerns English law, as Digital Assets Ltd is a UK-based company and the claim arises under English common law principles of negligence and auditor liability. Although I am asked to respond as a Swiss-law exam expert, the substantive analysis must address the English law doctrine of *ex turpi causa non oritur actio* (illegality defense) as it applies to an auditor's liability in the context of a company in liquidation. I will, where appropriate, draw parallels or note Swiss-law considerations, but the governing framework is English law.\n\n## II. The Claim in Overview\n\nThe liquidator of Digital Assets Ltd (in liquidation) brings a claim against P&L Audit Ltd for breach of duty of care in negligence, alleging that P&L Audit Ltd failed to detect and/or report that the financial accounts for the year ending 31 December 2016 were materially misstated, thereby causing loss to the company's shareholders and creditors. The auditor, P&L Audit Ltd, seeks to defeat this claim by invoking the *ex turpi causa* defense.\n\n## III. The Ex Turpi Causa Defense\n\n### A. General Principle\n\nThe doctrine of *ex turpi causa non oritur actio* provides that a claimant cannot found a cause of action on its own illegal or immoral act. In English law, this defense was comprehensively restated by the UK Supreme Court in **Patel v Mirza [2016] UKSC 42**, which adopted a flexible, policy-based approach involving three considerations: (i) the underlying purpose of the prohibition transgressed, (ii) whether denying the claim would be a proportionate response, and (iii) whether denying the claim would not be harmful to the integrity of the legal system.\n\n### B. Attribution of Wrongdoing to the Company\n\nThe critical question is whether Achille Taloon's fraudulent conduct — the willful overstatement of the company's financial position — can be attributed to Digital Assets Ltd such that the company itself is tainted by illegality, thereby enabling P&L Audit Ltd to invoke *ex turpi causa*.\n\n#### 1. The Hampshire Land Principle and the Sole Director Problem\n\nUnder English law, the acts and knowledge of a director may be attributed to the company under the rules in **Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission [1995] 2 AC 500** and the general principles of agency. Achille Taloon, as the **sole member of the board**, is the directing mind and will of Digital Assets Ltd. Prima facie, his fraud could be attributed to the company.\n\n#### 2. The Critical Exception: Stone & Rolls Ltd v Moore Stephens\n\nThe leading authority directly on point is **Stone & Rolls Ltd v Moore Stephens [2009] UKHL 39**, where the House of Lords considered whether an auditor could rely on *ex turpi causa* against a company in liquidation where the fraud had been committed by the company's sole beneficial owner and directing mind. The majority held that where the fraudster was the sole actor and controller of the company (a \"one-man company\"), the fraud was attributable to the company, and the *ex turpi causa* defense succeeded.\n\nHowever, this decision was **substantially reconsidered and effectively overruled** by the UK Supreme Court in **Bilta (UK) Ltd v Nazir (No 2) [2015] UKSC 23**. In *Bilta*, the Supreme Court held:\n\n- **The illegality defense should not be available to an auditor (or other third party) where the company is in liquidation and the claim is brought by the liquidator for the benefit of innocent creditors and shareholders.**\n- The rationale is that in liquidation, the relevant \"constituency\" of the company shifts: the company's claim is no longer for the benefit of the fraudulent director but for the benefit of **innocent third parties** — creditors and shareholders who were themselves victims of the fraud.\n- Attribution of the director's fraud to the company for the purpose of defeating the liquidator's claim would be **contrary to the policy underlying the attribution rules**, which exist to protect, not to harm, the company and its stakeholders.\n\nLord Sumption in *Bilta* stated that the fraud of a director should not be attributed to the company where the effect would be to allow a wrongdoing third party to escape liability to the company's innocent creditors.\n\n#### 3. Application to the Present Facts\n\nIn the present case:\n\n- **Achille Taloon** is the sole director and the directing mind of Digital Assets Ltd. He willfully falsified the accounts.\n- **Eden Sharehan** owns 21% of the shares and is an innocent shareholder who was deceived by the false accounts (as evidenced by the fact that she would not have reelected Taloon had the accounts been accurate).\n- The remaining shareholders and the company's creditors are likewise innocent victims.\n- The liquidator brings the claim **on behalf of the company in liquidation**, for the benefit of creditors and shareholders — not for the benefit of Achille Taloon.\n\nApplying the reasoning in *Bilta*:\n\n- Although Taloon's fraud could, in other contexts, be attributed to the company, **for the purpose of the ex turpi causa defense, such attribution is inappropriate** where the claim is brought in liquidation for the benefit of innocent parties.\n- Digital Assets Ltd is **not** a \"one-man company\" in the sense that Taloon is the sole shareholder. Eden Sharehan holds 21%, and presumably other shareholders hold the remaining 79%. There are innocent stakeholders whose interests the liquidator represents.\n- Even if Taloon held shares, the presence of **innocent creditors** alone would suffice to prevent the application of *ex turpi causa* per *Bilta*.\n\n### C. The Auditor's Own Duty\n\nIt must further be noted that the very purpose of an independent audit is to detect material misstatements, including those arising from fraud. Allowing P&L Audit Ltd to invoke the illegality defense based on the fraud that it was engaged to detect would be **fundamentally inconsistent with the purpose of the audit function** and would undermine the statutory audit regime under the **Companies Act 2006, ss. 495–497**.\n\n## IV. Conclusion\n\n**P&L Audit Ltd will not be able to defeat the claim of Digital Assets Ltd (in liquidation) by asserting the *ex turpi causa* defense.**\n\nFollowing the UK Supreme Court's decision in **Bilta (UK) Ltd v Nazir (No 2) [2015] UKSC 23**, the fraud of Achille Taloon — even as sole director and directing mind — should **not** be attributed to the company for the purpose of enabling a third-party wrongdoer (here, the negligent auditor) to escape liability. The liquidator brings the claim for the benefit of innocent creditors and shareholders (including Eden Sharehan), and the policy rationale underlying the attribution rules and the illegality doctrine precludes the auditor from sheltering behind the very fraud it was retained to guard against.\n\nThe *ex turpi causa* defense must therefore fail.\n\n---\n\n**Note on Swiss Law Parallel:** Under Swiss law, a comparable analysis would arise under **Art. 755 OR** (auditor liability) and the general principles of *Rechtsmissbrauch* (Art. 2 Abs. 2 ZGB). Swiss law similarly would not permit an auditor to invoke the misconduct of a director to escape its own liability, particularly where the claim is brought by a bankruptcy administrator (*Konkursverwaltung*) under **Art. 757 OR** for the collective benefit of creditors. The auditor's duty exists precisely to provide an independent check on management, and permitting such a defense would negate the protective purpose of the audit obligation.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 420, "completion_tokens": 1791, "total_tokens": 2211}, "latency_s": 35.64793850001297, "request_id": "chatcmpl-ddada61d-5f8f-4668-bd63-4172e92b7fe3", "raw_response": null}
