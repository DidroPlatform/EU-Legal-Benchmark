The candidate answer discusses the UK-SG treaty (Section 2.4) and mentions that the UK has a treaty with Singapore (Art. 14 provides a 0% rate for royalties where the beneficial owner is a UK resident). However, it does not explicitly state that the UK-SG treaty limits double taxation 'similar to the NE-SG treaty' (where NE is presumably the Netherlands, which is the NL-SG treaty discussed). The analysis focuses heavily on the NL-SG treaty and only mentions the UK-SG treaty as a contingency/alternative, without drawing the specific comparison requested by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d95e0739-9b6d-47af-9399-80ae5fb237bb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3662, "completion_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 3879}, "latency_s": 0.7995363750378601, "request_id": "w-WUafjlMZSX28oPufzfqQM", "raw_response": null}
