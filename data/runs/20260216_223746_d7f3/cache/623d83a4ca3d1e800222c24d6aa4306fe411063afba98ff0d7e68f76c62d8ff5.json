Specifically, under Control Point 2 (Data Retention & Destruction), it mandates an 'Quarterly retention policy review against regulatory changes' and an 'Annual comprehensive retention policy review'. Furthermore, Section IV (Control Point 10) includes an 'Annual independent assurance review' of the control environment, and Section IX (Annual Control Testing Calendar) outlines quarterly and annual reviews of various control aspects. This satisfies the requirement to specify a periodic review/update cadence for the control framework itself (at least annually and after any significant transaction or regulatory change, which is implied by the quarterly regulatory review).\", \"criterion_id\": \"b4fb4f36-550a-4487-b61b-d99adc7a0d42\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4022, "completion_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 4209}, "latency_s": 0.9920193330035545, "request_id": "_NKUae_gF-mekdUPq_LrcQ", "raw_response": null}
