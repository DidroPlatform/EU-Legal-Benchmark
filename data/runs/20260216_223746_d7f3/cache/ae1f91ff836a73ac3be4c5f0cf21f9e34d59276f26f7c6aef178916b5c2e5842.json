The candidate answer provides an extensive and relevant analysis covering these points. However, the specific criterion being evaluated is whether the response discusses the doctrine of separability (an arbitration clause is independent of the main contract). The candidate answer does not explicitly mention or discuss the doctrine of separability, although the concept is implicitly related to the tribunal's ability to rule on its own jurisdiction (competence-competence). Since the criterion requires explicit discussion of separability, and it is absent, the grade must be 0.\", \"criterion_id\": \"35536524-cce3-4fcd-b96e-c553e851b879\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4033, "completion_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 4213}, "latency_s": 0.8563788750034291, "request_id": "DM2Uaa-sJseUnsEPgvzb-AQ", "raw_response": null}
