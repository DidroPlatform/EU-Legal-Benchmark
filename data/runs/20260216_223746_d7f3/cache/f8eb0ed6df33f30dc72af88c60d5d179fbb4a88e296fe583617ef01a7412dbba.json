{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 1, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires the response to list at least two of the following additional reasonable steps: staff fire-safety training, maintenance of firefighting equipment, or appointment of fire wardens. The candidate response explicitly mentions 'Training records' under Section 4 (Documentation & Compliance Records) and implies the need for staff training as part of demonstrating compliance. While it doesn't explicitly list 'staff fire-safety training' or 'appointment of fire wardens' as standalone required steps in the main 'What you'd need to demonstrate' sections, it lists 'Training records' as essential evidence, which strongly implies the need for staff training. Furthermore, the context of demonstrating reasonable steps under the FSO inherently requires these elements. However, to strictly meet the criterion, I must check if two are explicitly listed as required steps. The response lists 'Training records' (implying staff training) and discusses the need to monitor compliance, which often involves wardens or equipment checks. Upon closer review of the detailed sections (1-4), the response focuses heavily on the FRA, equipment management (PAT testing), and documentation. It does not explicitly list 'staff fire-safety training', 'maintenance of firefighting equipment', or 'appointment of fire wardens' as required steps to demonstrate reasonable implementation, although 'Training records' are listed as documentation to gather. Since the criterion asks for listing the steps themselves, and the response only strongly implies one (training) via documentation, it does not clearly list two distinct steps from the required set. Re-evaluating: The response lists 'Training records' as essential evidence, which confirms the necessity of training. It does not explicitly list 'maintenance of firefighting equipment' or 'appointment of fire wardens' as required steps for the owner to demonstrate. Therefore, it fails to list two of the specified items.\", \"criterion_id\": \"cbbcb42e-6929-4e60-8717-70dc5a43eb9f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2855, "completion_tokens": 418, "total_tokens": 3273}, "latency_s": 1.9199894579942338, "request_id": "6NyUacyCCMK0vdIP75DNmA8", "raw_response": null}
