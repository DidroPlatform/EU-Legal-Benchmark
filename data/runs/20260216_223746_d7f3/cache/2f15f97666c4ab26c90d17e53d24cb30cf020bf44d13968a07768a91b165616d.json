This is the standard continuation when the Court finds the complaint raises sufficiently serious legal questions warranting full examination. Options A, B, and C all concern inadmissibility determinations (either declaring admissible without proceeding or rejecting as manifestly ill-founded), which would typically conclude rather than extend an argument. Option D's structure—finding serious legal questions, confirming no other inadmissibility grounds, and announcing merits consideration—represents the natural progression of a substantive ECHR argument.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 478, "completion_tokens": 152, "total_tokens": 630}, "latency_s": 2.354572582989931, "request_id": "chatcmpl-8b06bfe2-2e38-4405-a0ee-9cd654d7051e", "raw_response": null}
