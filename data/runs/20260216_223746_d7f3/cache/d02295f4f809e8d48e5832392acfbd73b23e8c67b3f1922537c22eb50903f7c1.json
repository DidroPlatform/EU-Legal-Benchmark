The Federal Assembly must declare invalid a popular initiative violating peremptory international human rights law (e.g., ECHR) and will not submit it to a vote (Art. 139(3) Swiss Constitution). ii. Incorrect. Swiss civil procedure applies a narrower concept of res judicata, limited to the operative part of the judgment (dispositif), not all findings of fact or legal assessments (Art. 59(2)(e) Swiss Civil Procedure Code). iii. Incorrect. Under Swiss contract law, if interpretations are equally admissible, the principle of favor negotii applies, and the contract is deemed valid (Art. 2 Swiss Civil Code). iv. Correct. The 2nd parentel includes the parents of the deceased and their descendants (Art. 458 Swiss Civil Code). Thus, ii and iii are incorrect.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 519}, "latency_s": 3.796591917023761, "request_id": "706701128c124518a73ac1a5e2f5efe3", "raw_response": null}
