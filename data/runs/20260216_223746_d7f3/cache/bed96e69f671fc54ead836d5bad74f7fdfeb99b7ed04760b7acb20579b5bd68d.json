The candidate answer states that counterclaims are 'one of the genuinely unsettled frontiers' and that 'nothing in that architecture naturally accommodates a state bringing its own affirmative claim for relief.' While it notes that the weight of authority leans against jurisdiction in the specific UNCITRAL/silent BIT context, it immediately follows this by detailing several leading cases (Burlington, Perenco, Urbaser) where tribunals *accepted* counterclaims based on broad consent clauses and ICSID rules. The conclusion section notes the trend is toward 'greater receptivity.' Therefore, the response does not assert that counterclaims are *usually* inadmissible; rather, it presents a nuanced view where admissibility depends heavily on the specific treaty language and rules, noting a trend toward acceptance in certain contexts.\", \"criterion_id\": \"191e67ef-7b2a-4b3a-a1e2-fe9e20a8a0b8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3313, "completion_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 3538}, "latency_s": 13.101878958026646, "request_id": "RMGUafDlIJf7xN8P843LwQ0", "raw_response": null}
