Actually, under Swiss OR Art. 23-24, a contract affected by fundamental error is indeed not automatically void but is voidable - so let me reconsider. Under Swiss law (CO Art. 23 ff.), error makes a contract non-binding on the party in error, who may declare it not binding - this is closer to voidable. However, the statement says 'voidable' which could be considered correct under Swiss law. Let me reconsider more carefully: In many civil law traditions, fundamental error makes a contract void (not voidable). Under Swiss law specifically, the erring party is 'not bound' and must invoke the error - this is functionally voidable. So statement i may actually be correct or incorrect depending on the legal tradition referenced. In Roman law tradition, fundamental error renders a contract void, not voidable. Since no specific jurisdiction is mentioned, and in general civil law theory fundamental error makes a contract void (not voidable), statement i is incorrect.\n\nStatement ii is incorrect: The Digest/Pandects has had an enormous impact on Western legal tradition - arguably more than the Codex Justinianus. The Digest was the foundation of the medieval revival of Roman law and the work of the glossators and commentators.\n\nStatement iii is incorrect: While Switzerland values education, the Swiss constitution provides that education is primarily a cantonal matter, not an extensive federal public education system. The statement's framing about 'direct democracy' and 'regeneration of cultural resources' seems off - this description better fits a different context.\n\nStatements iv and v seem largely correct. The magic formula is indeed a practice not explicitly in the Constitution. Statement v about burdens/conditions in testamentary dispositions is a standard civil law principle.\n\nThe combination i, ii, and iii corresponds to answer J.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 439, "completion_tokens": 461, "total_tokens": 900}, "latency_s": 11.224254041007953, "request_id": "chatcmpl-127399a4-0940-4079-b571-0e073d583af0", "raw_response": null}
