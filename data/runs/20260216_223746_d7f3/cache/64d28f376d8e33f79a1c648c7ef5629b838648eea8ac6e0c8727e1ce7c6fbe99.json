{"provider": "vercel_gateway", "model": "vercel_ai_gateway/openai/gpt-5.2", "text": "Below is a unified internal control framework that ties together (1) **DTA preservation**, (2) **DPT defence readiness**, and (3) **GAAR exposure management** into an audit‑committee-ready risk and compliance model. It is designed so each control point has a **clear owner**, a **measurable KPI**, and a **cadence** that lets the audit committee assess ongoing legal/tax integrity (not just year-end compliance).\n\n---\n\n## 1) Governance, Accountability & “Tone from the Top”\n\n### Control point 1.1 — Tax risk appetite, governance charter, and delegated authorities\n- **Control objective:** Ensure decisions that could impact DTA recognition, DPT position, or GAAR exposure are taken at the right level with documented rationale.\n- **KPI(s):**\n  - % of “in-scope” transactions approved per Delegation of Authority (DoA) (target: 100%)\n  - # of breaches of DoA for tax-sensitive matters (target: 0)\n  - Time from issue identification to governance decision (SLA metric)\n- **Audit committee cadence:** **Quarterly**, plus **exception reporting within 10 business days** of any breach.\n\n### Control point 1.2 — Tax Control Framework (TCF) / Senior Accounting Officer-style certification (where applicable)\n- **Control objective:** Maintain an operating control framework that supports defensible filing positions and accounting outcomes.\n- **KPI(s):**\n  - Control operating effectiveness rate (% controls tested “effective”) (target e.g.: ≥95%)\n  - # of high-risk control deficiencies open >90 days (target: 0)\n  - % of tax policies reviewed/updated within last 12 months (target: 100%)\n- **Audit committee cadence:** **Semi-annual** deep dive;

≥3 = Red”) and assign owners (1st/2nd/3rd line).\n\n---\n\n### Two clarifying questions (so I tailor it to your structure and jurisdictions)\n1. Which accounting regime are you under for DTA/UTP (IFRS, UK GAAP, US GAAP), and which jurisdictions are in scope for DPT/GAAR?\n2. Do you already have a Tax Control Framework/SAO-style control library, or are we building from scratch?\n\nIf you answer those, I’ll convert this into an audit-committee-ready control matrix (Control ID, owner, evidence, KPI, threshold, cadence) aligned to your actual entities and risk rating.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 97, "completion_tokens": 3115, "total_tokens": 3212}, "latency_s": 65.70922404099838, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJ47M60SV6ZVD5M6B24JZ5", "raw_response": null}
