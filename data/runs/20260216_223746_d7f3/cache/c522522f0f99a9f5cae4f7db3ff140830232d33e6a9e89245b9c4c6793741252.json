Capacity of judgement is presumed under Swiss civil law.**\n- This is CORRECT. Under Swiss civil law (Art. 16 Swiss Civil Code), capacity of judgement is presumed for adults.\n\n**ii. The \"Digest\" (or \"Pandects\") was compiled from works written by Roman legal experts between the 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE.**\n- This is INCORRECT. The Digest was compiled in the 6th century CE (533 CE) under Emperor Justinian, drawing from works of Roman jurists primarily from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE. The statement confuses the compilation date with the source material period.\n\n**iii. The international community formally recognized the neutrality of Switzerland with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.**\n- This is INCORRECT. Swiss neutrality was formally recognized by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, not the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.\n\n**iv. Legal sociology develops theories which simplify segments of reality in an exemplary way.**\n- This is CORRECT. This describes the theoretical modeling approach in legal sociology.\n\n**v. Swiss commercial law requires a limited partnership to have only partners with limited liability.**\n- This is INCORRECT. A limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) must have at least one general partner with unlimited liability and at least one limited partner.\n\nIncorrect statements: ii, iii, and v\n\n{\"answer\": \"B\", \"reasoning\": \"Statements ii (Digest compilation period), iii (Swiss neutrality recognition date), and v (limited partnership structure) are incorrect. The Digest was compiled in 533 CE, Swiss neutrality was recognized in 1815, and limited partnerships require at least one general partner with unlimited liability.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 360, "completion_tokens": 402, "total_tokens": 762}, "latency_s": 6.156744457985042, "request_id": "chatcmpl-6524756e-4417-4f29-a1b9-4d2bb9c40daf", "raw_response": null}
