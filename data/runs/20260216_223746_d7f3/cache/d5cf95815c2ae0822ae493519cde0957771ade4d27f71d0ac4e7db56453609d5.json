The candidate answer discusses moral rights (Section 77 - right to be identified, and Section 80 - right to object to derogatory treatment) in Section 3, which are related statutory rights often pursued alongside copyright infringement, especially concerning attribution and integrity in advertising. While it does not explicitly use the term 'Passing Off' (a common law tort), the discussion of moral rights directly addresses the issues of attribution and the reputational harm caused by the advertisement, which are the core concerns that would lead to exploring non-copyright routes like Passing Off or regulatory complaints. The candidate's focus on moral rights (s.77 and s.80) serves the spirit of the criterion by addressing non-economic rights related to the misuse of the work in advertising, which often overlaps with the concerns addressed by Passing Off or regulatory bodies regarding false endorsement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3c4a1956-325d-40bb-be88-615f367b771b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3491, "completion_tokens": 254, "total_tokens": 3745}, "latency_s": 1.635656625003321, "request_id": "TsCUabRmlLyewQ-c8aiJDw", "raw_response": null}
