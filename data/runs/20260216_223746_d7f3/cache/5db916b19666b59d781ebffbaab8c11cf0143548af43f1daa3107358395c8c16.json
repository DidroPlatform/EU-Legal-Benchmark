It states that the court will usually let the injunction stand, possibly 'subject to a stay or a \\u2018conditional\\u2019 order pending the tribunal\\u2019s decision' (Short Answer). Furthermore, Section 3, Step 2, discusses checking the 'Availability of an equivalent interim measure from the tribunal,' and Section 4 details how the order is structured, often stating it will be stayed if the tribunal issues an inconsistent order. This directly satisfies the requirement that the response mentions coordination, including potentially requiring undertakings (or stays/conditional orders) to avoid duplication or conflict.\", \"criterion_id\": \"82d417e5-a48b-47a7-a121-4a84d221e9c5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3897, "completion_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 4092}, "latency_s": 1.0242190830176696, "request_id": "veqUaf6zBZzRjrEPntD-yAI", "raw_response": null}
