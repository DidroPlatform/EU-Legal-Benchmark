The candidate answer provides a detailed breakdown in Section 3, 'Hidden Costs You\\u2019ll Meet After the Compromesso,' which includes the 'Registration tax (imposta di registro)' listed as '2% (first-home *prima casa*) or 9% (second home) of the declared price.' While it doesn't explicitly list the 200\\u20ac or 0.5% figures often associated with the *compromesso* registration tax (which is typically 200\\u20ac flat fee or 0.5% if the *compromesso* is registered before the final deed, or 3% if it's a commercial property), it clearly provides the main registration tax percentages (2% and 9%) that apply to the final deed (*rogito*), which is the most significant tax component mentioned in the context of property transfer costs. Given the comprehensive nature of the cost breakdown, this is considered a satisfactory fulfillment of providing a concrete tax breakdown.\", \"criterion_id\": \"40c39cdb-4a31-4cdb-84b7-89f2ebc16228\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4207, "completion_tokens": 294, "total_tokens": 4501}, "latency_s": 5.279002292023506, "request_id": "DeeUaaa5E5e4xN8PoZ_BiQQ", "raw_response": null}
