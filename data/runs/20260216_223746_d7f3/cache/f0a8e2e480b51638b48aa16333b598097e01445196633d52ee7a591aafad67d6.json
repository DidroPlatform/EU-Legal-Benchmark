Furthermore, the candidate answer does not discuss the public policy defense (Article V(2)(b)) in the context of a *New York* injunction causing a public policy violation; it only addresses how the supplier might *raise* the public policy defense against the Paris award, which is the opposite of what the criterion asks for.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f101b285-a1a0-4537-859b-11fe9252516e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4045, "completion_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 4251}, "latency_s": 0.9351411669922527, "request_id": "Fs2UaZKyLLnu7M8P587SoAI", "raw_response": null}
