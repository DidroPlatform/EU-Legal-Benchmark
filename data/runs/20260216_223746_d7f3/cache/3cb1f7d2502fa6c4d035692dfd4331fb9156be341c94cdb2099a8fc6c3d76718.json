The candidate answer discusses the current effective U.S. tax rate on GILTI (10.5% currently, 13.125% after 2025) and mentions the foreign tax credit limitation based on the 21% U.S. corporate rate. However, it does not explicitly discuss the *possibility of a future increase* in the statutory GILTI rate itself (e.g., if Congress were to change the Section 250 deduction or the underlying corporate rate that drives the GILTI calculation beyond the scheduled 2025 change). The discussion focuses on current rates, scheduled changes, and FTC limitations, not future legislative uncertainty regarding the rate structure.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ab6537c1-ea7d-4131-8b53-f4b93ec39eff\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3218, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 3428}, "latency_s": 0.8472437500022352, "request_id": "D9SUaaWEEemekdUPuPLrcQ", "raw_response": null}
