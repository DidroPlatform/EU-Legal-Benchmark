The candidate answer discusses the Green Lane system under the Windsor Framework, stating that goods in the Green Lane are for the UK internal market and have minimal checks. It does not mention the UK Internal Market Scheme (UKIMS) by name, nor does it explicitly state that all goods in the Green Lane must be labeled \\\"Not for EU\\\". While this labeling requirement is a feature of the UKIMS implementation of the Green Lane, the response fails to mention this specific detail as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b4f62aa7-ff31-4313-810b-5af8db9c969b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2970, "completion_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 3152}, "latency_s": 0.7534963749931194, "request_id": "jQGVab2xC9uxnsEPg_7zyAU", "raw_response": null}
