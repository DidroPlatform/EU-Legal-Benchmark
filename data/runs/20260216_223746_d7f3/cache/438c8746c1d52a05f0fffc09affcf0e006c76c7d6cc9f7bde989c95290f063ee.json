The candidate answer analyzes intervening acts, but it focuses on whether the *truck driver's negligence* or the *second driver's reaction* broke the chain of causation. It does not present the specific argument required by the criterion: that the *drunk driver's own swerve* was an intervening act that broke the chain because a reasonable, sober person would have reacted differently (e.g., by stopping or merging carefully) rather than swerving into another car. The candidate answer concludes the drunk driver's actions *established* causation, rather than arguing they *broke* causation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"59f0e49d-855e-44f4-bd5f-6e656891aa30\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2080, "completion_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 2305}, "latency_s": 0.8303803749731742, "request_id": "Bf-UaZefLZHw7M8Pi4iBgAU", "raw_response": null}
