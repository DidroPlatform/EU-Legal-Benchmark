The candidate answer addresses this under Section 1.E, stating: 'The character as a worker-rights advocate tied to an Italian movement could be framed as political commentary. That can strengthen a parody/caricature argument, but again: mass commercial merchandising without authorization is not automatically protected.' While the answer focuses more on parody/fair use exceptions rather than explicitly naming the 'right of integrity' (which protects against derogatory treatment), it clearly implies that unauthorized commercial use of the character in a political context is likely an infringement under Italian law, which is the core concept being tested by the criterion (i.e., that political commentary is not an automatic defense against unauthorized commercial use). Given the context of EU/Italian law, the right of integrity (moral right) is often invoked alongside economic rights when the work is modified or used in a way that prejudices the author's honor or reputation, which is relevant when the character is repurposed for a political movement without consent. The response correctly identifies this specific shirt as having a potentially arguable defense (political commentary) but concludes that unauthorized commercial use weighs against protection, aligning with the expected analysis that it would likely be deemed a violation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a87ee2ed-7a89-48f0-9c97-02ca08e4b193\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2471, "completion_tokens": 327, "total_tokens": 2798}, "latency_s": 1.3670639169868082, "request_id": "oiGVaeOvEJjknsEPxt7C0AU", "raw_response": null}
