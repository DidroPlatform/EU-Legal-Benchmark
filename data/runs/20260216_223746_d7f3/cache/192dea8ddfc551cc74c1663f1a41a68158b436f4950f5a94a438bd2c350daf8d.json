This is a standard formulaic continuation in ECHR judgments dealing with Article 8 violations. The other options involve cross-referencing findings under different articles (Articles 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) which represent different analytical contexts and would require specific preceding factual/legal setups that are less universally applicable as a natural continuation of an Article 8 analysis.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 389, "completion_tokens": 162, "total_tokens": 551}, "latency_s": 5.4475569580099545, "request_id": "chatcmpl-899f400e-f529-4e81-85f3-30ba2ab8756c", "raw_response": null}
