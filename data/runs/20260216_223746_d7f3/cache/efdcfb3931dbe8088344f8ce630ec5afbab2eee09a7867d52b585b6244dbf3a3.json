Specifically, it states: 'Italy (implementing EU law) recognizes certain exceptions/limitations, including caricature, parody, and pastiche (EU InfoSoc/DSM framework).' and 'The best shot at parody, but commercial merchandising still often loses if it takes too much and harms the merch/licensing market.' This directly addresses the requirement that the response states that parody is a work that comments on the original work, as the discussion centers on how these exceptions function as defenses against infringement based on commentary or transformation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b07ae9a2-e64c-4687-a3c3-40377ca89fd4\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2451, "completion_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 2658}, "latency_s": 0.8998848749906756, "request_id": "tSGVaeL1Mt_x7M8P1Ouu-QQ", "raw_response": null}
