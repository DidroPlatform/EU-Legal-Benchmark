The candidate answer discusses the claimant's potential legal status (tenant, lodger/licensee, or no right to occupy) and the protections associated with each, which inherently addresses whether they have a 'right in the land' (a legal status that grants occupation rights). However, it does not explicitly state the legal principle that *actual occupation alone is insufficient without a right in the land* (e.g., an overriding interest under property law requires actual occupation PLUS a proprietary right). The answer focuses on the *type* of right they might have, rather than stating the prerequisite that a right must exist for occupation to confer protection against a new owner.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8718243c-5ff0-4b5c-8761-fc13dc640746\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1582, "completion_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 1786}, "latency_s": 0.7892236660118215, "request_id": "XRSVaYvdItusvdIPxq2K-AU", "raw_response": null}
