Here's what the process typically involves:\n\n## How Courts Decide\n\nThe judge evaluates whether the person (*beneficiario*) needs assistance managing personal or financial affairs due to physical or mental impairment. Key factors:\n\n- **Medical assessment** - The court usually orders an evaluation by a court-appointed physician (CTU - consulente tecnico d'ufficio)\n- **Proportionality** - The support should match actual needs (this is less restrictive than full guardianship/*tutela*)\n- **Best interests** - The judge considers what preserves the person's autonomy and dignity\n- **The person's wishes** - If possible, the beneficiary is heard and their preferences considered\n\n## Required Documents\n\nTypically needed for the petition (*ricorso*):\n\n- **Medical certificates** documenting the condition and limitations\n- **Identity documents** for both the proposed guardian and beneficiary\n- **Statement of relationship** and willingness to serve\n- **Financial documentation** (if managing assets will be involved)\n- **Detailed description** of what assistance is needed\n- **Certificate of residence** (*certificato di residenza*)\n\n## Guardian Responsibilities\n\nThe court decree (*decreto*) specifies exact duties, but commonly includes:\n\n**Financial management:**\n- Managing bank accounts, pensions, bills\n- Protecting assets\n- Submitting periodic accounting reports to the judge\n\n**Personal care decisions:**\n- Healthcare consent (within limits specified)\n- Living arrangements\n- Daily life assistance\n\n**Legal obligations:**\n- Acting in the beneficiary's best interest\n- Reporting significant changes to the court\n- Seeking court approval for major decisions (selling property, etc.)\n- Maintaining the person's autonomy wherever possible\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- The beneficiary **retains rights** not specifically assigned to the guardian\n- The arrangement is **flexible and reviewable** - it can be modified as needs change\n- Your friend should consult a lawyer (*avvocato*) to file the petition at the *Tribunale* (Court) where the parent resides\n\nWould you like information about any specific aspect of this process?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 70, "completion_tokens": 486, "total_tokens": 556}, "latency_s": 9.706002874998376, "request_id": "chatcmpl-e0391502-02aa-433d-a5cd-f6093b005567", "raw_response": null}
