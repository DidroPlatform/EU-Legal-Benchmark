While the candidate answer correctly analyzes the user's status as a likely licensee/unlawful occupier and discusses protections against eviction (which are often tied to actual occupation rights, especially in the context of overriding interests in registered land, which is relevant when a property is sold), it never explicitly names or discusses the legal principle of 'actual occupation' itself. The analysis focuses on tenancy status (AST vs. Licence) and the Protection from Eviction Act, rather than the specific concept of 'actual occupation' as an overriding interest that might bind the new purchaser, which is the core legal principle implied by the scenario (a buyer purchasing a property where someone is still living there). Therefore, the criterion is not explicitly satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d3fe8fdc-4186-4aac-aa48-c595472e7863\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3330, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 3544}, "latency_s": 1.047573417017702, "request_id": "R-WUabKTA_fSvdIPupepiA8", "raw_response": null}
