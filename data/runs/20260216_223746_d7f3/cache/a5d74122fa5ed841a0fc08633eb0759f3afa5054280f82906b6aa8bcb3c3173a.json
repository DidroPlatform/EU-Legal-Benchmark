Methodologically secular approaches to human rights seek justification through reason, philosophy, or other non-religious foundations.\n\n**Statement ii**: \"The principle of the oldest parentel means that only the members of the oldest generation alive are heirs...\"\n- This is **incorrect**. The principle of parentelic succession (parentel system) means that descendants of the closest common ancestor inherit first. If the deceased has children, they inherit before parents. The statement reverses this - it incorrectly states parents would inherit over children.\n\n**Statement iii**: \"Human rights cannot be justified outside of the context of Western culture.\"\n- This is **incorrect**. Human rights can be and have been justified through various cultural, philosophical, and religious traditions worldwide, not just Western culture. This is a culturally relativist claim that is widely disputed.\n\n**Statement iv**: About diverging contract interpretations and Swiss contract law.\n- This is **incorrect**. Swiss contract law (and most legal systems) doesn't require that diverging interpretations mean no contract exists. Courts can interpret contracts objectively, and Swiss law has principles for dealing with interpretation disputes without voiding the contract entirely.\n\n**Statement v**: \"If there is a sufficient legal basis for state action, this action is, without further ado, always proportionate.\"\n- This is **incorrect**. A legal basis is necessary but not sufficient. State action must also satisfy proportionality requirements separately - it must be suitable, necessary, and proportionate in the narrow sense.\n\nIncorrect statements: ii, iii, iv, and v\n\n{\"answer\": \"N\", \"reasoning\": \"Statements ii (misrepresents parentelic succession), iii (human rights can be justified beyond Western culture), iv (misrepresents contract law principles), and v (legal basis doesn't automatically ensure proportionality) are all incorrect.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 414, "completion_tokens": 441, "total_tokens": 855}, "latency_s": 7.641008957987651, "request_id": "chatcmpl-3e43c030-bf5d-4d5d-b760-d1446c881d38", "raw_response": null}
