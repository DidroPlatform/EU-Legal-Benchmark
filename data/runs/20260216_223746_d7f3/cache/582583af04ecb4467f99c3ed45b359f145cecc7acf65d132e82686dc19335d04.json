The candidate answer mentions using Delaware law to argue against reputational damages (Section 3, Position 3: \\\"Invoke limitation of liability / exclusion of consequential damages (reputation harm often fits there)\\\") and generally discusses damages strategy (Section 3, D). However, it never explicitly states the three specific Delaware common law requirements for proving reputational damages (foreseeability, non-exclusion, reasonable certainty) as mandated by the criterion. The analysis is strategic rather than a direct statement of the required Delaware legal test for this specific type of damage.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b891ecd1-29ed-48ab-b657-193a39d276ac\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3286, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 3487}, "latency_s": 0.9802540419623256, "request_id": "HB-VaZKONeKAkdUPiI2EmQs", "raw_response": null}
