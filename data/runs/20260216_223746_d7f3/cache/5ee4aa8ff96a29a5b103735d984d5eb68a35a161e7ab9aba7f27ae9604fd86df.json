The candidate answer mentions Section 163(j) limiting interest deductions and separately mentions the BEAT rules applying to 'deductible interest to related foreign persons' if base erosion payments exceed thresholds. It does not explicitly state the relationship that interest disallowed under 163(j) is still counted for BEAT purposes. In fact, the BEAT calculation generally focuses on *deductible* payments, and the interaction between disallowed 163(j) interest and the BEAT base is complex and often depends on whether the disallowed interest is capitalized or otherwise treated for tax purposes, which the response fails to clarify or address as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3ec09ae2-9160-4ab5-a811-fda20235c726\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3233, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 3449}, "latency_s": 0.9642943340004422, "request_id": "N9SUaeaIGIminsEP87S6kAU", "raw_response": null}
