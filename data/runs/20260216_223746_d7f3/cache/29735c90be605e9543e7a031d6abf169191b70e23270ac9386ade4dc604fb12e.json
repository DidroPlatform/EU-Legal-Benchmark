The candidate answer analyzes the *strategy* for defending against the termination claim (e.g., arguing improper termination, pretextual grounds, analyzing warranty limitations) but it does not affirmatively state that the facts presented *do not* support a valid breach by the client. In fact, the analysis is structured around *defending* against the allegation of breach (security vulnerabilities) rather than asserting that the facts provided show the client *did not* breach. Since the prompt only provided the client's suspicion (that the German firm found a cheaper product), the response should have noted the lack of evidence *for* a valid breach, or at least acknowledged that the facts provided do not establish one. Instead, it focuses entirely on the defense strategy against the *alleged* breach.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d5afc437-3642-4325-9116-c899\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2704, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 2927}, "latency_s": 1.081311874993844, "request_id": "KtKUacH9H9fu7M8Pk_6wkAU", "raw_response": null}
