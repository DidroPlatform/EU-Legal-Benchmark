It follows the standard structure: (1) acknowledges the complaint is linked to Article 8, (2) declares admissibility, (3) notes the merits have been examined above with a violation established, and (4) concludes it's unnecessary to examine separately under another article. This mirrors the logical flow of ECHR decisions where courts avoid duplicative analysis once a violation is found. Options A and B use similar structures but reference different procedural contexts. Option D breaks the pattern by continuing to examine admissibility rather than moving to the conclusion about separate examination.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 591, "completion_tokens": 155, "total_tokens": 746}, "latency_s": 2.0778906250197906, "request_id": "chatcmpl-c5770c55-65b7-4a21-aa8e-c69c4c65df88", "raw_response": null}
