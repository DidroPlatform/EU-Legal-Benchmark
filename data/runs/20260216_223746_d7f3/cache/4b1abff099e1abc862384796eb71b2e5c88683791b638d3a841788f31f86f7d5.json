The candidate answer discusses the intoxication complication, noting that a defence counsel would argue the excessive nature of the swerve was caused by the impairment, and that a sober driver might have reacted differently. However, the candidate concludes that the chain is *probably not broken* because the swerve was a foreseeable reaction. It does not explicitly state that the *intoxication level* itself is evidence used by the truck driver to argue the drunk driver's actions were unreasonable and constituted a *novus actus interveniens*. While the concept is discussed implicitly (the impairment being the reason the swerve was excessive), it fails to state the specific point required by the criterion: that the *level of intoxication* is evidence used in the defence's argument for intervening causation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b3573ee1-8fb6-4d07-8572-3a1e1a5480e2\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2709, "completion_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 2956}, "latency_s": 1.2015035419899505, "request_id": "m8KUaeLWKYWjnsEPtLnfyQM", "raw_response": null}
