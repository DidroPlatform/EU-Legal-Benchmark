It sets up the three-part test (prescribed by law, legitimate aim, necessary in a democratic society) and announces the Court will examine each criterion sequentially. This is a natural opening to the proportionality analysis, whereas option C jumps ahead to conclusions about 'prescribed by law' and legitimate aim, option B shifts to Article 8 which would be a reframing rather than a continuation, and option D uses Article 8 language ('in accordance with the law') rather than Article 10 language ('prescribed by law'), suggesting a different article is at issue. Option A provides the cleanest and most logical continuation of an Article 10 interference analysis.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 650, "completion_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 834}, "latency_s": 5.516228958993452, "request_id": "chatcmpl-09d27183-1ef0-4747-85a5-aee7018267f9", "raw_response": null}
