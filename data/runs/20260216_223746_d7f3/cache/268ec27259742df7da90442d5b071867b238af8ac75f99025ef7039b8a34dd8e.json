The reference answer also notes G's actions were aimed at compliance.\\n3. **M:** The candidate correctly identifies M's abstention as potentially leading to liability under Art. 37 Abs. 2 GwG (negligence), noting the uncertainty, which aligns with the reference answer's focus on whether abstention constitutes a causal act or complicity.\\n\\n**Deviation/Weakness:** The candidate's answer is structured in English first, then summarized in German, which is slightly unusual for a strict legal analysis prompt, but the legal reasoning aligns well with the reference answer's conclusions regarding H, I, J, K, and G. The reference answer provides a much deeper dive into causality and Mittäterschaft for H, I, J, K, which the candidate omits, focusing only on the outcome (willful violation). However, the final assessment of who is liable is largely correct based on the provided facts and the reference logic.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.85}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3502, "completion_tokens": 397, "total_tokens": 3899}, "latency_s": 1.5190331669873558, "request_id": "qhOVaZ_ICtrzxs0PvK7U4Ao", "raw_response": null}
