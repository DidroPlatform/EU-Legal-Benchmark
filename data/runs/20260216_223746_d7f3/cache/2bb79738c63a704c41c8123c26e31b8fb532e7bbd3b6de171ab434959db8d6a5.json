The candidate answer explicitly addresses practical steps to prevent inadvertent triggering of anti-deferral regimes, stating: 'The parties should elect check\\u2011the\\u2011box classifications that treat the Luxembourg and Irish entities as corporations for U.S. tax, keep detailed inter\\u2011company loan agreements with market\\u2011based interest rates, and ensure that the debt\\u2011to\\u2011EBITDA ratios stay within the Section 163(j) safe\\u2011harbor limits to preserve the interest deduction.' While the response does not explicitly mention 'Section 267A' by name, the context of financing through intercompany debt and the mention of 'consistent classifications' (implied by the check-the-box election and documentation) and 'timing of payments' (implied by managing cash flows and debt structure) strongly suggests addressing the core concerns related to debt characterization and related-party payments, which is the essence of the risk area §267A addresses (deductibility of interest paid to related foreign parties). Furthermore, the response directly mentions check-the-box elections, satisfying a key example provided in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c05399c2-d5e1-4ad7-9c7a-4923f72f8897\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1999, "completion_tokens": 349, "total_tokens": 2348}, "latency_s": 1.355261792021338, "request_id": "m_KUabPnM-TQnsEPhvGb-Ag", "raw_response": null}
