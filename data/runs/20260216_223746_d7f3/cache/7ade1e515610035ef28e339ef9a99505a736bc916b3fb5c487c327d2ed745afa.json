The candidate answer concludes that the chain of causation is 'Probably NOT Broken' and that the truck driver would 'likely be held to have caused the injuries.' This directly supports the premise of the criterion: the truck driver is likely liable unless the intervening act breaks the chain. The analysis focuses heavily on why the drunk driver's actions are unlikely to break the chain, thus establishing the truck driver's likely liability.\", \"criterion_id\": \"13ad59d3-0614-44b5-9ff4-b6db76ef2755\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1263, "completion_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 1442}, "latency_s": 1.2018489589972887, "request_id": "wdGUafTmJo3znsEPmfLf8QQ", "raw_response": null}
