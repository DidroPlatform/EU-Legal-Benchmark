The candidate answer provides several KPIs under Control Point 3.1 (Tax Position Assessment & GAAR Risk Scoring) and Control Point 3.2 (Primary Purpose Documentation), but none of the listed KPIs are explicitly described as a binary metric confirming the contemporaneous existence of a commercial rationale defense file for high-risk steps. For instance, KPI 3.1.2 is 'High-risk GAAR positions identified' (Monitored), and 3.2.1 is '% of material positions with documented primary purpose' (Target 100%). While 'Genuine commercial rationale' is a component of the risk score (3.1 GAAR Risk Scoring Framework), the required KPI itself (a binary check on contemporaneous file existence) is missing.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a85735ff-ff32-4ffc-9f8b-6b04dff5966d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4112, "completion_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 4353}, "latency_s": 1.9229399159667082, "request_id": "9-GUacDtC6H0xN8P39CegA8", "raw_response": null}
