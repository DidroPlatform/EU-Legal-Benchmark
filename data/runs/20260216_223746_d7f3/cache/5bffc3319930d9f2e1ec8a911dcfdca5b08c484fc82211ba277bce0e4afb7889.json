Here's how it works:\n\n- **The publisher sets the retail price**, not the author\n- This is a legal obligation under the *Loi n°81-766 du 10 août 1981*\n- Retailers can only offer a **maximum 5% discount** on that price\n\n### For digital/online books specifically:\nThe **Loi n°2011-590 du 26 mai 2011** extended the fixed price system to **ebooks** (*livres numériques*). So even for online-only publication, the publisher sets the price.\n\n## Your Negotiation Position as Author\n\nLegally speaking:\n\n- **The publisher has the legal prerogative** to set the price\n- However, in your **publishing contract** (*contrat d'édition*), you can try to **negotiate a clause** giving you consultation rights or even approval rights on pricing\n- Your **royalties** are typically calculated as a **percentage of the retail price**, so the price directly affects your income\n\n## Important Considerations for Your Specific Work\n\nSince your work is a **collection of annotated newspaper extracts**, you should be careful about:\n\n1. **Copyright on the original articles** — Do you have authorization from the original authors/newspapers? Newspaper articles are protected works in France\n2. **The qualification as a \"book\"** — Your work needs to meet the legal definition of a *livre* to fall under these laws (the work must constitute an intellectual creation, not merely a compilation without originality)\n3. Your **annotations and arrangement** may qualify as original work, giving you author's rights on that added layer\n\n## Practical Advice\n\n| What you can negotiate | Difficulty |\n|---|---|\n| A minimum price floor in the contract | Moderate |\n| Consultation before price changes | Reasonable |\n| Veto power on price | Difficult — publishers rarely accept |\n| Royalty rate (to offset price concerns) | Most common lever |\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n**Legally, you have no right to impose the price** — that power belongs to the publisher under French law. But contractually, **everything is negotiable before you sign**. Your strongest lever is typically the **royalty percentage** rather than the price itself.\n\n> **I'd strongly recommend** consulting a lawyer specializing in *propriété intellectuelle* or contacting the **SGDL** (Société des Gens de Lettres) before signing, especially given the copyright questions around your source material.\n\nWould you like me to go deeper into any of these aspects?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 80, "completion_tokens": 654, "total_tokens": 734}, "latency_s": 17.543590750021394, "request_id": "chatcmpl-4f83d5b0-9c40-4585-8654-04bf178a2ba7", "raw_response": null}
