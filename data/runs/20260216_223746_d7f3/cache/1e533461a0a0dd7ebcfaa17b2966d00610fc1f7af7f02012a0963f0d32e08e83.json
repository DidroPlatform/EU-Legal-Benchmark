It states this variant is a 'Derivative work (still infringing)' and notes that while the vendor might attempt a parody defense, 'a mere \\u201cpolitical costume\\u201d is unlikely to qualify.' Furthermore, under the 'Moral rights' section (2), it explicitly lists the 'right of integrity' as a non-waivable right in Italian law. By classifying the political re-dress as an infringing derivative work that likely fails the parody defense, the response strongly implies a violation of the author's rights, including the right of integrity, which is the core of the criterion's requirement regarding that specific shirt variant in Italy.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a87ee2ed-7a89-48f0-9c97-02ca08e4b193\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4499, "completion_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 4764}, "latency_s": 1.2454325830331072, "request_id": "c_OUab1uw97szw-J2JvIAw", "raw_response": null}
