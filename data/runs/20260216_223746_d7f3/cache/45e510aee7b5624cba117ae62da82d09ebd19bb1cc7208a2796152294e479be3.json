False** - Excessive self-defense is regulated in Criminal Code Chapter 4, Section 4, paragraph 2 (not Section 6, paragraph 3).\n\n**B. False** - Excessive self-defense is not \"permitted\" (sallittua). Rather, it exempts from criminal liability under specific conditions (excusable fear, confusion, or surprise).\n\n**C. True** - According to Criminal Code Chapter 4, Section 6, paragraph 3: \"The punishment may be mitigated... if the offence has been committed in circumstances closely resembling those exempting from criminal liability\" - which includes situations similar to but not quite meeting the requirements for excessive self-defense exemption.\n\n**D. False** - Excessive self-defense is not a mistake about circumstances exempting from liability. It's a situation where the defender actually exceeded necessary force but is excused due to excusable fear, confusion, or surprise during a real attack.\n\n{\"answer\": \"C\", \"reasoning\": \"Criminal Code Chapter 4, Section 6(3) explicitly allows mitigation of punishment when an offense is committed in circumstances closely resembling those that would exempt from criminal liability, which includes situations similar to excessive self-defense.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 283, "completion_tokens": 296, "total_tokens": 579}, "latency_s": 6.593177959002787, "request_id": "chatcmpl-4afc66c2-f9a7-42b1-b975-36023bcf5a76", "raw_response": null}
