The candidate answer explicitly addresses this under the section discussing Section 44 of the Arbitration Act 1996, stating: 'The court will not act if the arbitral tribunal (or a court with more appropriate jurisdiction) has already granted, refused, or is likely to grant/refuse the relief.' While it doesn't use the exact phrasing 'seat of arbitration is outside England & Wales,' the context of s44(2A) and s44(5) directly relates to the court's discretion when dealing with foreign-seated arbitrations (like Singapore) and whether the tribunal or another court is the more appropriate forum, which satisfies the core requirement of noting the court's power to refuse based on appropriateness concerning the foreign seat.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f319b040-3157-48dd-bb9f-24ca01953844\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1715, "completion_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 1955}, "latency_s": 0.8409124589525163, "request_id": "QSiVaeeRMqG-nsEPq8WDwQc", "raw_response": null}
