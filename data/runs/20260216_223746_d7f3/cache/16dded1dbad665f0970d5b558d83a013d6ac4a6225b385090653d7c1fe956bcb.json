The candidate answer discusses the MLI PPT risk in the context of the NL-SG treaty benefit, noting a 'High denial risk' because the principal purpose is 'WHT avoidance/routing'. However, it does not explicitly list the specific substance requirements mentioned in the criterion (board members living in NL, local bank accounts, board decisions in NL) as necessary to satisfy the PPT. It mentions adding 'NL substance (qualifying R&D/employees in GP/CV)' to flip to a safe PE, which is related but not the specific list required by the criterion for PPT avoidance.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1ec1c16b-4fae-4d4d-96a5-80edc66797ba\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1075, "completion_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 1294}, "latency_s": 0.711714375007432, "request_id": "aSOVadz7LoqjkdUP-qvu2QQ", "raw_response": null}
