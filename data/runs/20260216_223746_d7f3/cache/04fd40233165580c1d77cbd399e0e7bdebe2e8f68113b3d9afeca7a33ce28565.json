{"provider": "nim", "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", "text": " In Italy, the procedure your friend is referring to is called **amministrazione di sostegno** (support administration), established under **Law 6/2004**. It replaced the older, more restrictive systems of *interdizione* and *inabilitazione*, and is designed to respect the elderly person's residual autonomy while providing necessary assistance.\n\nHere is a practical overview of how it works:\n\n## 1. How the Court Decides\n\nThe competent court is the **Tribunale** (Court of First Instance) where the elderly parent resides. The judge evaluates:\n\n- **Actual Impairment**: Medical evidence must show a condition (physical, mental, or psychological) that prevents the person from managing their affairs, even with ordinary assistance.\n- **Proportionality**: The court applies the \"least restrictive measure\" principle. If the parent can still handle some matters (e.g., daily shopping) but needs help with banking or complex medical decisions, guardianship will be limited to those specific areas.\n- **Necessity**: The judge verifies that less formal alternatives (power of attorney, family support) are insufficient or no longer viable due to the person's declining capacity.\n- **The Person's Will**: The court should consider the parent's wishes and any advance directives, if available.\n\n**Outcome**: The court issues a decree (*decreto*) specifying exactly what the guardian can do (e.g., \"manage bank accounts and real estate,\" \"consent to medical treatments,\" etc.). The parent retains legal capacity for all other acts.\n\n## 2. Documents Required\n\nYour friend (or the applicant) must file a **petition (*ricorso*)** including:\n\n- **Medical Documentation**: Recent medical certificates or psychiatric evaluations (issued within 6 months) detailing the diagnosis and prognosis, specifically addressing the inability to manage personal/financial affairs.\n- **Administrative Documents**:\n  - Valid ID and tax code (*codice fiscale*) of both the parent and proposed guardian\n  - Family status certificate (*certificato di stato di famiglia*)\n  - Residence certificate (*certificato di residenza*)\n- **Draft Support Plan (*Progetto di sostegno*)**: A written proposal outlining how the guardian will manage affairs, what specific powers are needed, and how the parent's dignity and autonomy will be preserved.\n- **Guardian Suitability Declaration**: Information proving the guardian is capable and has no conflicts of interest (no criminal record, financial solvency if managing assets).\n- **Consent of the Parent** (if possible): Even if capacity is diminished, expressing willingness to accept support strengthens the application.\n\n*Note: If the elderly person is in immediate danger (e.g., financial exploitation, medical emergency), the court can appoint a temporary guardian (*amministratore di sostegno provvisorio*) within days, pending full evaluation.*\n\n## 3. Guardian Responsibilities\n\nThe **amministratore di sostegno** has fiduciary duties and must:\n\n- **Act in the Best Interest**: Prioritize the parent's welfare, health, and dignity, taking into account their wishes and lifestyle preferences.\n- **Respect the Scope**: Never exceed the specific powers granted in the court decree. If the decree covers only financial management, the guardian cannot make medical decisions without a specific addendum.\n- **Render Accounts**: Submit annual reports (*rendiconto*) to the court detailing all income, expenses, and asset management. Major transactions (selling property, changing investments) usually require prior judicial authorization.\n- **Maintain Contact**: Regularly visit the parent to assess their condition and needs, ensuring they are not isolated.\n- **Preserve Autonomy**: Encourage the parent to participate in decisions they are capable of making.\n- **Confidentiality**: Keep personal and medical information private.\n\n**Liability**: The guardian can be held personally liable for damages caused by negligence or exceeding their authority.\n\n## Practical Tips for Your Friend\n\n1. **Consult a Lawyer (*Avvocato*)**: While family members can file petitions, Italian succession and capacity law is complex; legal counsel ensures the *progetto di sostegno* meets judicial standards.\n2. **Consider Alternatives First**: If the parent still has lucid periods, a *procura speciale* (special power of attorney) with an anti-incompetency clause (*clausola di conservazione*) might suffice and is less invasive.\n3. **Act Early**: The process takes 3–6 months (or longer if contested). If the parent's condition is progressive, starting before a crisis prevents emergency interventions.\n4. **Public Guardian**: If no family member is suitable, the court will appoint a *professionista* (lawyer, accountant, or social worker) or the *Ufficio di Sostegno* (Support Office) at the local municipality.\n\nWould you like details on how to challenge or modify a guardianship decree if the parent's condition changes over time?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 74, "completion_tokens": 1683, "total_tokens": 1757}, "latency_s": 52.539646374993026, "request_id": "chatcmpl-b4e04d9e4280e113", "raw_response": null}
