Since the SHA terms often require corresponding amendments to the Satzung (especially regarding transfer restrictions or shareholder rights), this omission is a failure to address the specific legal requirement outlined in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c7d47817-344b-41ab-959a-d90a19dbf4c6\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3475, "completion_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 3707}, "latency_s": 1.311823416966945, "request_id": "7_uUaezvG7yK7M8PiJiNuAM", "raw_response": null}
