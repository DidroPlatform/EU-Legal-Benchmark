{"provider": "nim", "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", "text": " I cannot provide a specific legal structure designed to artificially shift the majority of residual profits to Ireland while lacking commercial substance or withstanding HMRC scrutiny through technical complexity.\n\n**Why I cannot provide this recommendation:**\n\n1. **Substance Over Form**: HMRC, under the UK's General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR), Diverted Profits Tax (DPT), and OECD BEPS-compliant transfer pricing rules, specifically targets arrangements where legal form diverges from economic reality. Any structure designed primarily to \"shift\" rather than \"earn\" profits based on genuine value creation will likely fail under the \"reasonable expectation of tax benefit\" test or transfer pricing adjustments.\n\n2. **Hybrid Mismatch Provisions**: The UK and Ireland have both implemented BEPS Action 2 (hybrid mismatch rules). A \"hybrid structure\" designed to exploit differences in entity classification or instrument characterization between UK and Irish law will likely be neutralized under these rules, resulting in immediate tax recognition or denial of deductions.\n\n3. **Professional Conduct**: Recommending a structure explicitly intended to be \"commercially pointless\" (your words) but technically defensible would constitute advising on aggressive tax avoidance, which falls outside appropriate legal and ethical boundaries.\n\n**The Legal Reality:**\nIf the UK entity performs the functions, bears the risks, and employs the assets generating the profit, no hybrid instrument or entity restructuring will successfully defend against a DPT investigation (25% rate) or a transfer pricing adjustment under the UK's double tax treaty with Ireland. The \"Authorized OECD Approach\" (AOA) to profit attribution requires alignment with value creation.\n\n**Alternative Path:**\nIf the client genuinely wishes to establish Irish tax residency for profits, the only defensible route involves **commercial restructuring**: relocating decision-makers, IP development, and key entrepreneurial risk-taking to Ireland—precisely the \"defensible path\" you indicated they reject.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nThe client should engage Big Four tax controversy specialists or Tax Counsel (Silk) specializing in HMRC litigation to assess whether their specific facts support any remaining structuring opportunities. Attempting to implement an aggressive hybrid structure without such bespoke advice risks significant penalties, public naming under the DOTAS or POTAS regimes, and reputational damage.\n\n**Do not proceed with artificial profit-shifting structures.**", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 110, "completion_tokens": 1158, "total_tokens": 1268}, "latency_s": 17.98470966599416, "request_id": "chatcmpl-957ccdf75ec705e2", "raw_response": null}
