The candidate answer explicitly cites and discusses *R v Palmer [1971] AC 814* and *Beckford v R [1988] AC 130* as binding common law authority within the English and Welsh jurisdiction, which is correct. The candidate answer does *not* state that these cases are not binding UK precedent; rather, it correctly uses them as foundational common law authority that informs the statutory test under s. 76 CJIA 2008. Therefore, the candidate answer fails to meet the negative requirement of the criterion (i.e., it does not state the incorrect premise that these cases are non-binding), meaning it satisfies the instruction to *not* include the specified incorrect advice.\", \"criterion_id\": \"bbfa06d0-1d7b-41af-bb76-fa659eee9bd5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4151, "completion_tokens": 237, "total_tokens": 4388}, "latency_s": 1.1974555000197142, "request_id": "LfeUadbZK67pnsEP2M6v6QU", "raw_response": null}
