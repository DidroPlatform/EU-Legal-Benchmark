The candidate response proposes establishing a UK Subsidiary (Option A) which acts as the IOR. In Section 5, under 'VAT EXPOSURE: Structural Mitigation', it describes the mechanism where the UK Subsidiary invoices the retailer and files VAT returns (Option 1). While this structure effectively manages VAT liability through the subsidiary, it describes the *operational flow* of the subsidiary handling VAT, rather than explicitly stating the necessity of a 'separate, back-to-back sales contract' between the French parent and the UK subsidiary to legally structure the transaction to avoid double VAT imposition or to correctly account for the intra-EU supply chain transition into the UK import chain. The proposed structure implies this contract exists but does not explicitly name or mandate the 'back-to-back sales contract' as the specific legal tool required to manage the VAT implications of the IOR shift.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2941285f-f638-4e87-9944-0cebd24bc52b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2818, "completion_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 3075}, "latency_s": 1.604578375001438, "request_id": "FNqUaY_8FuP8xN8PwI38yAI", "raw_response": null}
