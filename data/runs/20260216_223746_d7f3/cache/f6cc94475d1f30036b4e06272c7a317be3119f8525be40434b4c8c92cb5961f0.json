This shows some engagement with legal/corporate governance concepts.\\n\\nHowever, the reference answer explicitly guides the expected discussion points, which heavily lean towards US/common law concepts (e.g., shareholder wealth maximization debate, Parkinson's social institution model, Janet Dine article, specific case law like a NJ Supreme Court case). The candidate's reliance solely on Swiss corporate law, while factually correct within that jurisdiction, fails to engage with the specific theoretical frameworks and examples suggested by the reference answer, which implies a focus on the broader CSR/Stakeholder vs. Shareholder debate often framed through US/UK legal theory in such courses.\\n\\nThe reference answer expects a discussion structured around specific theoretical models (Social Institution Model, stakeholder obligations) and specific examples/cases. The candidate's answer is too narrow, focusing only on Swiss law interpretation of director duties, and misses the core theoretical comparison requested by the reference structure.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.4}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1124, "completion_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 1381}, "latency_s": 1.1854479160392657, "request_id": "vROVae-vNc_c28oPsY6G4AQ", "raw_response": null}
