The candidate answer correctly identifies *R v Keane* but misstates its principle. *R v Keane* deals with the defendant's own intoxication or recklessness causing a mistaken belief, not the revival of self-defence after the defendant initiates an attack. The principle described in the criterion (revival after disproportionate retaliation) relates more closely to the concept of 'loss of temper' or 're-entry into the fray' following an initial aggression, which is not the focus of *R v Keane* as cited here. Furthermore, the candidate answer does not discuss the victim's retaliation being disproportionate to the client's initial (claimed) minor attack in the context of *R v Keane* or any other relevant case.\", \"criterion_id\": \"653cb3de-b54e-4fad-a0f4-e0a95a9f150d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4325, "completion_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 4576}, "latency_s": 1.1138977499795146, "request_id": "f9iUaZP-A6iSkdUPmsP7uA8", "raw_response": null}
