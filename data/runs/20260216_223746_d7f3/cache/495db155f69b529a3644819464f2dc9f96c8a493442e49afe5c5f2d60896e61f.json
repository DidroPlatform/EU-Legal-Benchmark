The candidate answer explicitly addresses this in Section 2.3 and Section 3 (Scenario A), noting that if the arrangement is deemed a conduit, the PPT (Principal Purpose Test) can deny the treaty benefit, which is the mechanism by which the benefit is denied in this context. Furthermore, Section 1 details how the LP could create a Dutch PE for itself, which would complicate the treaty claim. The analysis directly covers the denial of the NL-SG treaty benefit due to anti-abuse rules (PPT) which is the primary risk associated with this structure, satisfying the core requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5d6ef8a4-5c02-47c4-af80-dcacf4655e93\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3650, "completion_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 3849}, "latency_s": 1.273812875035219, "request_id": "oeWUab_zEYzLvdIPg8L54AI", "raw_response": null}
