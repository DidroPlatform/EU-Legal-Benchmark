The candidate answer explicitly refuses to recommend a specific structure and instead details why such a structure would fail HMRC scrutiny (GAAR, transfer pricing, DPT). It does not explain the mechanics of how an Irish entity earns residual profit within any specific structure (like a CCA/CFC context).\", \"criterion_id\": \"8559825d-0a97-436f-8e02-2a3f73d2d493\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 787, "completion_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 978}, "latency_s": 1.0627888329909183, "request_id": "uN6UaaXbDZ6YvdIP0OSwgAI", "raw_response": null}
