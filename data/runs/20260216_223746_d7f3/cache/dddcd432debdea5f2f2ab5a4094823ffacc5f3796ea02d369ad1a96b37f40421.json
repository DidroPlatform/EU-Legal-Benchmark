He published 'A Memory of Solferino' (Un Souvenir de Solférino) in 1862. Statement ii is incorrect: Swiss criminal procedure (StPO/CPP) provides for mandatory defense (notwendige Verteidigung) in certain cases, such as when the accused faces serious charges or is in pretrial detention, meaning the accused must have defense counsel regardless of their wishes. Statement iii is essentially correct in describing the objective theory of contract interpretation under Swiss law - when subjective interpretations diverge, Swiss law applies objective interpretation (the trust principle/Vertrauensprinzip) rather than simply declaring no contract exists, so the statement that 'there is no consent but rather dissent and therefore no contract' is actually the incorrect approach, but the statement says 'Swiss contract law is governed by different principles,' which acknowledges this. So statement iii is actually correct. Statement iv is correct: the Code of Obligations of 1881 did comprise general and specific obligations law plus commercial and exchange law provisions. Statement v describes limited liability, which is a feature of both the AG (Aktiengesellschaft) and GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) - shareholders' liability is generally limited to their investment. This is correct. So statements i and ii are incorrect.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 331, "completion_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 669}, "latency_s": 10.210541500011459, "request_id": "chatcmpl-c6e5e3aa-d9f3-4b92-bab5-71367151c93f", "raw_response": null}
