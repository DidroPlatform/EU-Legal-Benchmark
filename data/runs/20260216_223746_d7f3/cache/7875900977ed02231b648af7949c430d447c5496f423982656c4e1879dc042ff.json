The candidate answer mentions Article 14(3) but incorrectly frames the discussion around whether Spain's reservation applies to Belgium based on Belgium's lack of a reservation against Spain. It does not explicitly state the core requirement of the criterion: that a Contracting Party *may reserve the right* under Article 14(3) not to apply Article 9(5). The answer focuses on the binding nature of the provisions rather than the reservation mechanism itself as described in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"criterion 6\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 616, "completion_tokens": 157, "total_tokens": 773}, "latency_s": 0.6933804169530049, "request_id": "ZBOVaf61KfT1xs0PlO7m0AQ", "raw_response": null}
