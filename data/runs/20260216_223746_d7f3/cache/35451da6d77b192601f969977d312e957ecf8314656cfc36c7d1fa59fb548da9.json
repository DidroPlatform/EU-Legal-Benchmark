The candidate answer discusses the court considering the 'Effectiveness of Arbitration' and whether the tribunal 'has the power to grant similar interim relief,' suggesting reluctance to intervene if the tribunal can act. However, it does not explicitly state the legal threshold that the court *shall act only if* the tribunal *cannot* act effectively, which is a specific legal standard often applied in this context (e.g., under the Arbitration Act 1996, s. 9(4) or related common law principles regarding support for arbitration).
