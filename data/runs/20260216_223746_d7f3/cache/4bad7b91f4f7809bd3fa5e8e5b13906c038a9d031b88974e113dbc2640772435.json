It discusses the foreseeability test from *R v Roberts* and *R v Marjoram*, concluding that swerving to avoid an obstacle is a 'foreseeable reaction' and that the truck driver must anticipate that other road users may be impaired. It contrasts this with the *Kennedy (No 2)* test but ultimately concludes that the swerve is a 'reactive' response, not a 'free, deliberate, and informed' act, making the truck driver's act likely to remain a legal cause. This directly satisfies the requirement of including the argument that the drunk driver's actions were not intervening because a reasonable person would have swerved similarly.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e6c03261-2d1c-42d6-bea6-ac11720c84cf\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2705, "completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 2907}, "latency_s": 0.9635409999755211, "request_id": "oMKUaaW8G8DzkdUPloGV4Ag", "raw_response": null}
