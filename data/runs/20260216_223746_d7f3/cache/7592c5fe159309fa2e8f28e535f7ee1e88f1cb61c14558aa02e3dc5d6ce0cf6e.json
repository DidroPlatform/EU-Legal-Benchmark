The candidate answer discusses the DUP boycott extensively, attributing it to their opposition to the original Protocol and the mechanisms they used (collapsing the Executive via the NI Act 2022). However, it does not explicitly state the political context regarding the Conservative Party's majority in 2019 removing the DUP's leverage over the UK government to block the Protocol's passage in 2020. The answer focuses on the DUP's actions *after* the Protocol was adopted, not the reason they couldn't block its adoption in 2020.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b181f9ff-7e5a-4930-93df-96349a113641\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4169, "completion_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 4393}, "latency_s": 0.9616169579967391, "request_id": "1cSUac6YPL3ukdUP_eOHsAM", "raw_response": null}
