The candidate answer focuses almost entirely on the occupier's status (licensee vs. tenant) under UK housing law (Protection from Eviction Act, AST rules) and the required notice/court process for eviction. It does not discuss the concept of 'overriding interests' or how the 'disponee's knowledge' affects the priority of those interests, which is a concept typically associated with registered land law (e.g., Land Registration Act 2002, Schedule 3, Paragraph 2) concerning equitable or proprietary rights that bind a new purchaser.
