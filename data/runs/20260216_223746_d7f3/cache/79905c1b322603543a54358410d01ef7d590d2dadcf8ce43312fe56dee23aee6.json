The candidate answer explicitly argues the opposite: that the drunk driver's swerve *was* an intervening act (a *novus actus interveniens*) that broke the chain of causation from the truck driver (D2), precisely because the swerve was deemed *unreasonable* and *grossly negligent* (double the legal limit, colliding laterally). The candidate answer relies on cases like *R v Roberts* and *R v Williams* to show that only *reasonable* reactions maintain causation, contrasting D1's extreme reaction. Therefore, the required argument (that the swerve was reasonable/expected) is absent; in fact, the opposite argument is central to the analysis regarding D2's liability.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e6c03261-2d1c-42d6-bea6-ac11720c84cf\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1720, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 1949}, "latency_s": 1.1118264579563402, "request_id": "XTGVadGAHaOF7M8P9PzH6Ag", "raw_response": null}
