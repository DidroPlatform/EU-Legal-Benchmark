{"provider": "nim", "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", "text": " **Do not drive home.** You risk being arrested, having your car seized, and facing prosecution if you drive alone now.\n\nHere's the legal position:\n\n**If you failed your UK practical test:**\nYou revert to being a provisional licence holder. This means you **cannot drive alone** – you must be accompanied by someone over 21 who has held a full EU/UK licence for at least 3 years, and you must display L plates.\n\n**About your \"international licence\":**\n- An International Driving Permit (IDP) is **not a standalone licence** – it's only a translation document that must accompany your actual national licence.\n- If you hold a full licence from another country, you can normally only use it in the UK for **12 months from when you became resident here**. If you've been resident longer, or if you've already applied for a UK licence and taken your test here, your foreign licence is likely no longer valid for UK driving.\n- If you've been living in the UK and applied for a UK test, insurers typically require you to be on a UK provisional licence with proper learner insurance.\n\n**The risks if you drive:**\n- **Driving without a valid licence** (driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence): Fine up to £1,000 and 3-6 penalty points\n- **Driving without insurance** (your insurance will likely be invalid if you're not properly licensed): Unlimited fine, 6-8 penalty points, possible disqualification, and **_vehicle seizure_** – police can confiscate your car on the spot\n- **Arrest**: Yes, police can arrest you for these offences and you could end up with a criminal record\n\n**What to do instead:**\n- Call a taxi/Uber\n- Use public transport\n- Phone a friend/family member who can legally drive your car or give you a lift\n- Arrange for someone with a full licence (meeting the requirements) to accompany you if you have L plates and valid learner insurance\n\nThe temporary inconvenience is far better than a criminal record, fines, and losing your car.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 46, "completion_tokens": 1359, "total_tokens": 1405}, "latency_s": 60.626720707979985, "request_id": "chatcmpl-a58bd20c2ded1bad", "raw_response": null}
