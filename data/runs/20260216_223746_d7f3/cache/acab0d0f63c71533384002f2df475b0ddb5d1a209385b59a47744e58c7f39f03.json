The candidate answer discusses the priority of a registered legal mortgage (the bank's charge) over an unregistered equitable interest (the constructive trust claim), which is the core issue when dealing with a lender/purchaser scenario. However, it does not explicitly use the term 'overreached' or explain the doctrine of overreaching in relation to the lender's priority, which is the specific concept tested by this criterion. It focuses on 'notice' and 'registration priority' instead of the mechanism of overreaching.\", \"criterion_id\": \"df80a01f-5c25-46b6-9fa5-097a4aa3f543\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2098, "completion_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 2280}, "latency_s": 0.723989000020083, "request_id": "oSeVaeTwLcyynsEPyd_uiAQ", "raw_response": null}
