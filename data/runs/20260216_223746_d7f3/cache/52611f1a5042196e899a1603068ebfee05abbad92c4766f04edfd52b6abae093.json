The claim that judgments become res judicata \"against any person who has an interest in the matter\" is overly broad and incorrect. Res judicata generally binds the parties, not all interested third parties.\n\n**Statement ii**: The Federal Council consists of seven members (not a Prime Minister plus six others). Switzerland has a collegial system with no Prime Minister. The Federal President is merely primus inter pares (first among equals) with no special powers to dissolve the Federal Assembly. This statement is incorrect.\n\n**Statement iii**: Under Swiss criminal procedure, a penal order (Strafbefehl) can be issued by the public prosecutor for sentences up to 6 months imprisonment (not 12 months). This statement is incorrect.\n\n**Statement iv**: According to Luhmann's theory of autopoietic social systems, systems are operationally closed and self-referential. The legal system doesn't \"trigger democratic impulses\" in politics in this direct manner - each system operates according to its own code. This characterization misrepresents the theory and is incorrect.\n\n**Incorrect statements: i, ii, iii, and iv**\n\n{\"answer\": \"F\", \"reasoning\": \"All four statements are incorrect: (i) res judicata doesn't bind all interested persons; (ii) Switzerland has no Prime Minister and the Federal Council has 7 equal members; (iii) penal orders allow up to 6 months, not 12; (iv) autopoietic theory doesn't describe legal systems triggering democratic impulses in this way.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 308, "completion_tokens": 381, "total_tokens": 689}, "latency_s": 8.90305641698069, "request_id": "chatcmpl-6a4ed084-f08b-405c-ab0f-eee5279c7afb", "raw_response": null}
