It correctly frames the discussion within the context of Swiss corporate law (OR articles cited) and relevant CSR/stakeholder concepts, which aligns perfectly with the structure and topics suggested by the reference answer (purpose of corporation, shareholder vs. stakeholder models, broader social responsibilities). The answer explicitly mentions the shareholder wealth maximization argument and contrasts it with broader responsibilities, covering the core requirements outlined in the reference. The structure is logical, moving from statutory basis to broader normative/stakeholder considerations. The reference answer suggests discussing specific theories (Social Institution Model, Dine article, NJ case), which are not explicitly detailed here, but the candidate covers the *themes* (stakeholder approach, ESG, legal duties beyond profit) comprehensively using Swiss law as the framework, which is appropriate given the context is likely a Swiss law course. The reference answer is a general guide, and the candidate provides a strong, contextually relevant execution.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.95}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2290, "completion_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 2530}, "latency_s": 1.4074646669905633, "request_id": "MPSUafyJA7zhnsEPwLCgiQY", "raw_response": null}
