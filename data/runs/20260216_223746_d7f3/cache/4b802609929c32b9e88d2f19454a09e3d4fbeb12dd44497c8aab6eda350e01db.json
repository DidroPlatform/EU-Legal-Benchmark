The candidate answer lists 'Italian counsel demand letters' as step 1 in immediate practical enforcement in Italy (Section 1, F.1). However, for the US analysis, the candidate answer discusses infringement basics, fair use, and trademark issues, but it never explicitly states that the first step in the US should be sending a cease and desist letter. It only mentions procedural advantages like registration. Therefore, the requirement to mention the cease and desist letter as the first step in *both* jurisdictions is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e11f5a8d-3a04-4866-b6e9-a4fa4bf32dba\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2458, "completion_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 2639}, "latency_s": 1.4279297920293175, "request_id": "2SGVaYCqFffo7M8PiZSSoQk", "raw_response": null}
