The candidate answer strongly asserts that the RGPD *does* apply and details what the association *should have done* (informed members via a privacy notice, documented legal basis, etc.). It mentions that there is no need to inform authorities upfront, which is an exception to a specific administrative step, but it does not address whether the *collection/processing itself* falls under an exception that negates the need for transparency or compliance measures. In fact, it argues the opposite: compliance steps were necessary. Therefore, the response does not explicitly state that the actions are unlikely to fall under an exception that would excuse compliance.\", \"criterion_id\": \"677ea83d-dbd3-4733-a995-63c750903e31\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1276, "completion_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 1494}, "latency_s": 1.1786539170425385, "request_id": "tSOVabH2CvnOnsEPkprNkQM", "raw_response": null}
