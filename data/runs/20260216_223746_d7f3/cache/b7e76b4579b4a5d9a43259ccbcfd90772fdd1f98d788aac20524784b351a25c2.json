Under Section 4.3 ('Parallel German Proceedings'), it states: 'German courts respect arbitration agreements (ArbG § 34). They will likely *stay* the German action if USCo files a *stay application* citing the arbitration clause.' Furthermore, under Section 4.4 ('Anti-Suit Injunction (ASI) in England'), it recommends applying for an ASI in the High Court to restrain the German distributor from pursuing parallel proceedings. This directly satisfies the requirement that the response identifies that if the German Distributor attempts to file in court, they will be in breach of the arbitration agreement, and a German court should dismiss or stay the action.\", \"criterion_id\": \"50faad98-d961-4c12-a76b-ce59b94c7973\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4295, "completion_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 4494}, "latency_s": 0.8741222920361906, "request_id": "-e-UaeCOM9HMkdUPyI67sAQ", "raw_response": null}
