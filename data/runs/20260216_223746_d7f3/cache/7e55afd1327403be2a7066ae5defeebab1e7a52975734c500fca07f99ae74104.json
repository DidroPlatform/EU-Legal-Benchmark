The candidate answer discusses these provisions (e.g., transfer restrictions, liquidation preference, pre-emption rights) extensively in the context of the SHA and German market practice, but it does not explicitly state that these specific provisions *must* be included in the Articles of Association (Satzung) for enforceability, which is the core requirement of the criterion. It mentions that transfer restrictions are natural because transfers require notarisation and that liquidation preference is implemented via SHA and articles, but it fails to make the explicit legal assertion required by the criterion regarding enforceability in the Satzung for share/third-party rights.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f462ad42-2453-401c-bc17-67772f6a802f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2931, "completion_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 3151}, "latency_s": 1.0745111249852926, "request_id": "bBuVae9KmeqR1Q_euOS5Cg", "raw_response": null}
