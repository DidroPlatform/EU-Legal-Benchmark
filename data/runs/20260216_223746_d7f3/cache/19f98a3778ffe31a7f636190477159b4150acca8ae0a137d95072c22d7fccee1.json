You're now facing a three-way dispute. But the claim that the lender automatically wipes you out is **far more contestable than they're suggesting**. Let me explain why.\n\n## The Lender Priority Argument - Why It's Not That Simple\n\nTheir solicitor is presenting this as settled law. It isn't.\n\n**The key question is timing.** If your constructive trust interest arose *before* the lender's charge was registered, there is a strong argument that your interest has priority. This is a fundamental principle of property law in most common law jurisdictions.\n\n**The logic works like this:**\n\n- You invested and created your interest (let's say 2-3 years ago)\n- Your ex remortgaged 6 months ago\n- The lender's charge was created *after* your equitable interest already existed\n- A lender cannot grant themselves priority over a pre-existing beneficial interest they had notice of, or should have discovered\n\n## The Critical Legal Concept: Notice and Overreaching\n\n**For the lender's charge to take priority over your interest, certain conditions typically need to be met:**\n\n- The lender would generally need to have had no notice of your interest\n- In many jurisdictions, if you were in **actual occupation** of the property at the time of the remortgage, your interest may be protected as an overriding interest regardless of registration\n- Even if you weren't in occupation, there are arguments around constructive notice\n\n**Key questions that matter enormously:**\n\n- Were you living in or regularly attending the property when the remortgage completed?\n- Did the lender conduct any inspection or valuation where your presence or your renovation work would have been apparent?\n- Did your ex declare to the lender that they were the sole beneficial owner? If so, that's potentially fraud on the lender as well\n\n## The Fraud Dimension Changes Everything\n\nThis is where their position becomes very vulnerable.\n\n**If your ex remortgaged the property by misrepresenting themselves as sole beneficial owner, knowing you had an interest, that is potentially:**\n\n- Fraud against the lender\n- Fraud against you\n- A criminal matter, not just a civil one\n\n**Why this matters for priority:** Courts have the power to set aside transactions that were procured by fraud. If the remortgage was obtained through misrepresentation of the ownership position, the charge itself could be challenged.\n\n**The lender's position is also more nuanced than they're suggesting.** Lenders in this situation often find themselves victims of the same fraud you are. In practice, this can mean:\n\n- The lender may have a claim against your ex personally rather than just against the property\n- The lender's solicitor may have been negligent in not identifying your interest\n- The charge may be voidable to the extent it was obtained by fraud\n\n## The \"Walk Away\" Offer Is a Pressure Tactic\n\nThink about what's actually happening here:\n\nYour ex took out €200k against equity *you* created, is now threatening you with litigation, and is offering to \"generously\" drop that threat if you abandon €180k. They are essentially asking you to fund their €200k windfall and be grateful they're not suing you on top of it.\n\n**This should tell you something about the strength of their position.** If the lender's charge genuinely wiped out your interest completely, your ex wouldn't need to offer you anything or threaten you. They'd simply let the legal process play out. The pressure tactic suggests they know their position is weaker than presented.\n\n## What You Need To Do Now - And This Is Urgent\n\n**Immediate steps:**\n\n1. **Do NOT accept the offer or sign anything.** This is a moment where walking away under pressure would be the most expensive mistake you could make.\n\n2. **You need a specialist property litigation solicitor immediately.** Not a general practitioner. Someone who handles constructive trust claims, lender priority disputes, and ideally has experience with fraud-related property cases. This has moved well beyond general advice territory.\n\n3. **Request a Land Registry search** (or equivalent in your jurisdiction) to see exactly what charges are registered, when they were registered, and the terms.\n\n4. **Gather and preserve all evidence** of your occupation, your investment, your communications with your ex about the property, and critically any evidence about what you knew or didn't know about the remortgage.\n\n5. **Consider whether to report the fraudulent remortgage.** This is a strategic decision your solicitor should advise on, but the possibility of criminal fraud is a significant factor in negotiations.\n\n6. **Contact the lender directly** (through your solicitor) to make them aware of your claimed interest. They may not know about it, and they have their own exposure here.\n\n## The Honest Assessment\n\nI want to be straightforward with you.\n\n**The strengths of your position:**\n- Timing of your interest versus the charge\n- Potential fraud in obtaining the remortgage\n- The pressure tactics suggest the other side knows this\n- Lenders can be sophisticated parties who recognise when they've been defrauded and may pursue your ex rather than you\n\n**The real risks:**\n- This is now complex multi-party litigation and will cost money to pursue\n- The outcome depends heavily on jurisdiction-specific rules I cannot determine without knowing exactly where this property is\n- Even with a strong legal position, enforcement and practical recovery take time\n- The lender is a well-resourced party with their own legal team\n\n**What I cannot tell you** is exactly how your specific jurisdiction handles the priority question between pre-existing equitable interests and later registered charges. The principles I've described are broadly applicable across common law systems, but the details matter enormously and vary by jurisdiction.\n\n**What I'm fairly confident about** is that the claim \"the lender automatically wipes you out\" is a significant oversimplification designed to make you capitulate. The legal reality is considerably more complex and more favourable to you than that.\n\nThis is the point where professional legal representation isn't optional - it's essential. The amounts at stake more than justify the cost, and the complexity of a three-party dispute involving potential fraud requires someone who can examine every detail of your specific situation.\n\nWould you like to discuss any particular aspect of this in more detail?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 220, "completion_tokens": 1408, "total_tokens": 1628}, "latency_s": 33.9005997920176, "request_id": "chatcmpl-c0b6dca2-4dbb-4b35-9ffd-de77c1a7f1cc", "raw_response": null}
