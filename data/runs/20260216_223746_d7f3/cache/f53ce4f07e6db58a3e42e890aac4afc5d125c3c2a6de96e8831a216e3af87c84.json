C. Applicable Law (Can the Tribunal Apply Domestic Environmental Law?)'. It discusses the need for the BIT to incorporate domestic law (either through explicit reference, an applicable-law clause including host-state law, or provisions referencing investor compliance) and specifically mentions that under ICSID, Article 42 defaults to host-state law, which is analogous to the custom/incorporation principle sought by the criterion.
