However, there are exceptions:\n- Art. 5 Abs. 2 WaG: No permit needed for temporary use of forest land for forest management purposes\n- Wildlife parks serving forest management purposes (wildlife care, feeding to prevent tree damage) can qualify as forest-related uses\n\nThe statement says \"Der Forstbetrieb benötigt für die Anlage des Wildtierparks eine Rodungsbewilligung\" (needs a clearing permit). Given that:\n1. This is operated by a forestry operation (Forstbetrieb)\n2. It serves wildlife care and rewilding\n3. Animals will be fed to prevent tree damage\n4. This appears to be a forest management purpose\n\nThis could qualify as a forest-related use not requiring a clearing permit, making the statement **potentially false**.\n\n**Statement ii (Kehricht-Grundgebühr):**\nThe question is whether Art. 19 Abs. 1 of the waste regulation complies with environmental protection law.\n\nArt. 19 Abs. 1 establishes:\n- Cost-covering and polluter-pays fees\n- Combination of basic fee (0.1‰ of building insurance value) and volume-based fees\n\nUnder Art. 32a USG (Environmental Protection Act), waste fees must be:\n1. Cost-covering (kostendeckend) ✓\n2. Based on polluter-pays principle (verursachergerecht) ✓\n\nThe regulation explicitly states both requirements and implements them through a mixed system (basic + volume fees), which is accepted practice in Swiss law.\n\nThe statement says this provision \"entspricht den Vorgaben des Umweltschutzgesetzes\" (complies with USG requirements). This is **true**.\n\nTherefore, statement i is false, statement ii is true.\n\n{\"answer\": \"A\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement i is false because a wildlife park operated by a forestry operation for forest management purposes (wildlife care, preventing tree damage) likely qualifies as forest-related use under Art. 5 Abs. 2 WaG and would not require a clearing permit. Statement ii is true because Art. 19 Abs. 1 properly implements the cost-covering and polluter-pays principles required by Art. 32a USG.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1184, "completion_tokens": 648, "total_tokens": 1832}, "latency_s": 13.624682374997064, "request_id": "chatcmpl-63e62194-a01d-49ef-890c-09fe43e15d3e", "raw_response": null}
