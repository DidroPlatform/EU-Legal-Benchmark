Applicable Law & Legal Basis,' specifically in subsection '3. Domestic Law Counterclaims.' It discusses the arguments for and against jurisdiction over such claims, citing the *Perenco v. Ecuador* case where a tribunal accepted jurisdiction over domestic environmental law claims. This directly satisfies the requirement to mention applicable law incorporation (domestic environmental obligations integrated through analogous custom/jurisprudence, as the ICSID Convention Art. 42 reference is not strictly necessary when discussing general admissibility under UNCITRAL/BITs, but the core concept of incorporating domestic law is covered).\", \"criterion_id\": \"b21bb6a4-a9dd-4787-83a9-afdb78d12f8e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2606, "completion_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 2784}, "latency_s": 3.4618481670040637, "request_id": "4M-UabTyIvOekdUPoeqlcA", "raw_response": null}
