It does not identify the *loss* of this relief as the *primary commercial trade-off* associated with shifting profits to Ireland, which would be the logical consequence of moving the profit-generating IP/activity out of the UK Patent Box regime.\", \"criterion_id\": \"115d5474-f6c3-4eb3-b66f-6587d7f33846\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1362, "completion_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 1549}, "latency_s": 1.7940987079928163, "request_id": "xsCUacDmDYminsEP87S6kAU", "raw_response": null}
