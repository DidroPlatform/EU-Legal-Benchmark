The candidate answer correctly identifies the primary source document, the 'Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, annexed to the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, signed 24 January 2020,' and states that the Framework replaces arrangements under the original Protocol. While the candidate focuses on the Windsor Framework (Feb 2023), it correctly establishes the legal foundation by referencing the Withdrawal Agreement and Protocol, which legally took effect on 31 December 2020 (the end of the transition period, which is the operative date for the Protocol's application, even if the agreement was signed earlier).
