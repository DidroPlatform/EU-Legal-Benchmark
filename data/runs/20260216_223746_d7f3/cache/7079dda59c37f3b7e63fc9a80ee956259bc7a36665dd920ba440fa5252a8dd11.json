The candidate answer explicitly states this principle under section 2(A) and reinforces it in the conclusion: \\\"The court will avoid undermining the arbitration and will limit the injunction\\u2019s scope to what is strictly necessary.\\\" and \\\"if the Singapore arbitration is already underway, the English court will defer to the tribunal unless there is a compelling reason to intervene.\\\" Furthermore, section 2(A) states the court will only exercise its power under s.44(2)(e) if the arbitral tribunal has not yet been constituted (or lacks power to act effectively) or the relief sought is urgent and cannot await the tribunal\\u2019s formation.
