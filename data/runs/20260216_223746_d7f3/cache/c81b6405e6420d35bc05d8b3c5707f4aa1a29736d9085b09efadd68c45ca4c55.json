However, the response does not explicitly mention or discuss s.44(3) or s.44(5). Section 44(3) deals with the court's power to grant relief where the seat is outside England and Wales, and s.44(5) deals with the court's power to grant relief where the tribunal has power to grant the relief itself. Since the response fails to mention s.44(3) and s.44(5), the criterion is not fully satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"bc4a8b46-ad9f-45a4-b4e0-4a96f0956e8b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2813, "completion_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 3069}, "latency_s": 0.880641249998007, "request_id": "NPqUae7vEceC7M8P_tvRkAs", "raw_response": null}
