The candidate answer analyzes the situation primarily through the lens of the drunk driver's liability, concluding that the drunk driver is likely liable because swerving into another car, even to avoid an obstacle, may still constitute dangerous driving, and the truck driver's negligence is unlikely to break the chain of causation. The candidate answer does not explore the specific scenario where the drunk driver's swerve is deemed *reasonable* (i.e., not negligent), which would be the necessary precursor to shifting total liability to the truck driver based on the criterion's premise. Therefore, the specific condition outlined in the criterion is not addressed or supported.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ff67bf61-062a-4cca-acf8-5003202b85d7\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2058, "completion_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 2279}, "latency_s": 1.0282588750123978, "request_id": "Hv-Uab-NONWbkdUPuuCoyAM", "raw_response": null}
