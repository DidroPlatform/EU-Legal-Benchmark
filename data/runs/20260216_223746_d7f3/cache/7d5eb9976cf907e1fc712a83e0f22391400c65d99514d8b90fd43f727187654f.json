The candidate answer explicitly lists these factors under section 2(C) 'The interference is \\u201cunreasonable\\u201d': It mentions 'Locality (character of the neighbourhood)' and 'Sensitivity' (judged by a normal occupier, contrasting with an unusually sensitive claimant). While it doesn't explicitly use the phrase 'physical vs sensible interference,' it covers the core concept by distinguishing between 'interference with use and enjoyment' (sensible) and physical damage (impliedly excluded as the focus is noise). It clearly covers the ordinariness/locality aspect and the sensitivity aspect, satisfying the core requirements of the rubric point.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d732e274-94d8-4fa0-8a0c-8ef5d4905abe\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1932, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 2161}, "latency_s": 0.847489542036783, "request_id": "dhqVaZ-JL6nw7M8Pu5DvyAM", "raw_response": null}
