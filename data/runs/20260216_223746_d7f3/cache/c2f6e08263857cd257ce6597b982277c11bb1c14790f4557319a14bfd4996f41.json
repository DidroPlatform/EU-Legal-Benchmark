The candidate answer explicitly mentions the Arbitration Act 1996 and, in Section 1, lists 'AA 1996 s.44(2) \\u2013 courts may grant interim measures \\u201cin support of arbitration\\u2019' and later refers to 'AA 1996 s.44(2)' again in the context of varying an order. While it cites s.44(2) instead of s.44(1), Section 44 of the AA 1996 deals with court assistance in relation to arbitral proceedings, and s.44(1) grants the court power to make orders for interim measures in support of arbitration where the tribunal has not been appointed or cannot act effectively. The response clearly addresses the statutory basis for court intervention in support of arbitration, which is the core intent of the criterion, even if it cites the subsection dealing with the court's power to modify existing orders (s.44(2)) rather than the initial grant of power (s.44(1)). Given the context and the detailed discussion of court support powers under the AA 1996, this is sufficient to satisfy the requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3bdbae35-6ab4-449e-ad7c-7ab762539ad0\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3888, "completion_tokens": 343, "total_tokens": 4231}, "latency_s": 26.000298625032883, "request_id": "nuqUaafZAYminsEP87S6kAU", "raw_response": null}
