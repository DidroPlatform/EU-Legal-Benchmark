This created a \"sea border\" with routine customs/SPS (sanitary/phytosanitary) checks on GB-NI goods, which unionists (e.g., DUP) saw as partitioning the UK. The EU applied the full protocol strictly (e.g., sausage war 2021), while the UK sought flexibilities.\n\nThe **Windsor Framework (WF)** (political agreement published 27 Feb 2023; legal text annexed to UK-EU Joint Committee Decision 1/2023 of 24 Mar 2023) replaced key Protocol elements with a \"green/red lane\" dual regime for goods, reducing checks and giving NI \"access to both markets\" (Sinn Féin's phrasing, though UK says it's UK internal market + EU access for NI consumers/businesses). It's not NI \"in both markets\" fully—NI remains UK territory/customs territory, but with EU rules for goods destined for Ireland/EU to protect the single market. Full text: [UK Gov PDF](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1130418/The_Windsor_Framework.pdf).\n\nNI is **not** a \"transit space port\" with minimal scrutiny in all directions:\n- **Inbound from GB**: Mostly \"green lane\" (minimal checks, UK internal market rules).\n- **Inbound from EU/Ireland**: Treated as intra-UK (green).\n- **Inbound from third countries (e.g., China)**: Enter UK customs territory at NI point of entry; green if staying in UK/NI, red if for EU (full EU checks).\n- **Outbound to Ireland/EU**: Red lane rules apply regardless of origin.\nSafeguards prevent it becoming a backdoor: data-sharing, labeling, customs declarations, and risk-based checks. No automatic free flow—goods must prove destination.\n\n### Key Safeguards in the Windsor Framework\n\nImplemented via UK law (e.g., **Windsor Framework (Constitutional Status of Northern Ireland) Regulations 2023**, SI 2023/569, 9 May 2023) and EU law (e.g., Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2023/1697 on green/red lanes).\n\n1. **Green/Red Lanes for Goods** (WF Sections 3-5, Annexes GREEN/RED):\n   - **Green Lane** (81% of GB-NI goods per UK data): For goods *staying in NI/UK*. Minimal checks (e.g., trusted trader pre-notification via UK IT system, no routine customs declarations). Data-sharing with EU via \"IDMS\" (new IT system, live Oct 2024).\n   - **Red Lane** (19%): For goods *destined for Ireland/EU*. Full EU customs/SPS/VAT rules, checks at GB/NI points.\n   - **Labelling**: Retail goods in green lane must have \"Not for EU\" labels if sold in NI (to prevent onward sale to Ireland).\n   - **Parcels**: Low-value (<£150) exempt from customs but risk-assessed; high-risk blocked.\n\n2. **Customs Union Protection** (WF Section 4):\n   - UK remains outside EU Customs Union. Goods from third countries pay UK duties unless for NI consumption (proof via data/audits).\n   - No free transshipment—third-country goods to NI need UK import declaration; if for EU, diverted to red lane.\n\n3. **SPS Rules** (WF Section 5, Annex SPS):\n   - Green lane: UK rules, no routine checks (e.g., no agri-food border post needed).\n   - Equivalence for NI agri-food to enter GB (via UK Global Food & Feed Safety Framework, but paused for some).\n\n4. **Democratic Safeguards**: Stormont Brake (below); UK can override via Article 16 safeguards (suspended but available).\n\nPrimary source: WF Annexes GREEN (pp. 22-28), RED (pp. 29-35); UK Guidance: [Green Lane](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-goods-into-northern-ireland-from-great-britain-the-green-lane).\n\n### Burden of Proof: \"Goods at Risk of Being Imported into the EU\"\n\nUnder WF (Annex GREEN para 12; RED para 3), the **burden is reversed from the Protocol**—no blanket presumption of risk.\n\n- **Default Presumption**: Goods from GB to NI are **NOT at risk** (green lane eligible) unless UK authorities have \"reasonable grounds to suspect\" diversion to EU (e.g., intelligence, patterns, non-compliance history). Burden on UK to prove risk (risk-based, not routine).\n  - Evidence: Trader data, sales records, audits. Only 0.8% of green lane goods checked (2024 data).\n  \n- **From Third Countries (e.g., China to NI)**:\n  - **Presumed NOT at risk** if declared for NI/UK end-use (green lane possible post-import).\n  - **Presumed AT RISK** if destined for EU/Ireland (red lane mandatory, full EU entry summary declaration).\n  - Direct import to NI: UK customs clearance first (NI as UK frontier). If no EU destination proof, green lane; EU intel can trigger red diversion.\n  - No \"de minimis\" loophole for high-risk goods (e.g., steel from China pays UK quotas/duties).\n  - Source: WF Art. 5(4); Commission Notice 2023/C 242/01 (27 Jun 2023) para 45-50.\n\nPre-WF (Protocol Art. 4), all GB-NI goods presumed at risk (burden on traders to prove not). WF flips to presumption of compliance. UK/EU Joint Committee oversees disputes.\n\n### The Stormont Brake\n\n**What it is**: A veto on *new* EU goods laws (post-WF) significantly affecting NI's trade with GB/UK internal market. Not retrospective (doesn't scrap existing alignments). Operational from 1 Jan 2024 via **Windsor Framework (Democratic Scrutiny and Consent) Regulations 2023** (SI 2023/1351, 19 Dec 2023).\n\n**How it works** (WF Art. 13(7); SI 2023/1351 regs 3-8):\n1. UK notifies NI Assembly of new EU law (e.g., via delegated acts on goods standards).\n2. **Petition**: 30 MLAs (from parties opposing the law) can petition within specified time.\n3. **Assembly Scrutiny**: Committee reviews; if not resolved, full Assembly votes (simple majority, cross-community consent not required).\n4. **Referral**: If passed, UK Minister assesses if it has \"significant impact\" on NI-UK trade.\n5. **Disapplication**: Minister can stop the law applying in NI (for up to 2 years, extendable). EU can't retaliate (WF Art. 14).\n\n**Limits**: Only ~5% of EU laws qualify (goods-related, significant impact). UK Minister has final say (not Assembly). First used? None yet (as of Oct 2024).\n\nPrimary source: WF pp. 16-17; [SI 2023/1351](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2023/1351/contents/made).\n\n### DUP Boycott and Context\n\nDUP (unionists) boycotted Stormont Assembly from May 2022 (after Protocol grace periods lapsed), collapsing power-sharing (required cross-community support). They rejected WF initially (Mar 2023) as insufficient—wanted full internal market restoration, no EU law supremacy.\n\nResolved Feb 2024 via **Safeguarding the Union** deal (Command Paper CP 889, 8 Feb 2024): DUP accepted WF + Brake + new UK laws (e.g., removing EU VAT on energy/donuts in NI, fast-track Article 16). DUP returned to Executive 3 Feb 2024. Sinn Féin called it \"internal UK matter.\"\n\nSources: [Safeguarding the Union](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65c5d7b2a77cc0055d905d3d/20240208_Safeguarding_the_Union_Command_Paper.pdf); DUP statement 8 Feb 2024.\n\nFor your student: NI has UK sovereignty + EU market access for qualifying goods, with brakes to prevent regulatory divergence harming UK unity.
