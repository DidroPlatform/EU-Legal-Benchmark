Transaction Snapshot  \n\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n| **Target** | Brazilian data‑analytics company (Sociedade Anônima – “BrazilCo”) together with its Chilean (SpA) and Mexican (S. de R.L. de C.V.) subsidiaries. |\n| **Acquirer** | U.S. technology group’s Latin‑American operating entities (U.S. parent → Luxembourg “HoldCo” → local subsidiaries). |\n| **Structure** | A **cross‑border merger** (Brazil‑style “fusões transnacionais”) that will create a **new regional holding company** (“LatAm Holding”) that will own the combined assets in Brazil, Chile and Mexico. |\n| **Financing** | Equity and/or mezzanine capital injected by a **Luxembourg investment vehicle (LuxCo)**; possible inter‑company loans from the U.S. parent. |\n| **Key Jurisdictions** | Brazil, Chile, Mexico – each with its own corporate, tax and regulatory regimes. |\n| **Objective** | Consolidate operations, achieve economies of scale, and enable a single regional platform for data‑analytics services while preserving tax efficiency and regulatory compliance. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Primary Seat of the Merger – “Where the Merger Lives”\n\n### 2.1 Recommended Primary Seat: **Brazil**\n\n| Reason | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **Legal Feasibility** | Brazil’s **Lei das Sociedades por Ações (Lei 6.404/1976)** expressly permits **cross‑border mergers (fusões transnacionais)** where a Brazilian corporation merges with one or more foreign entities, provided the merger is incorporated by a Brazilian corporation (the “surviving” entity). |\n| **Asset Weight** | The majority of the combined EBITDA and strategic IP (data‑analytics platform, client contracts) are located in Brazil. |\n| **Regulatory Centrality** | The merger will trigger **Brazilian foreign‑investment clearance (CVM, Banco Central)** and **competition review (CADE)**; locating the seat in Brazil simplifies coordination with the Brazilian authorities, who have the power to block the transaction if the seat were elsewhere. |\n| **Tax Efficiency** | Brazil’s **non‑resident withholding tax** on dividends is lower (15 % + 10 % surtax) when the recipient is a **resident holding in a treaty‑partner** (Luxembourg). A Brazilian seat allows the use of the Brazil‑Luxembourg DTT to reduce dividend withholding to **0 %** (subject to the “beneficial‑owner” limitation). |\n| **Corporate Governance** | The Brazilian board can act as the “lead” board for the merger, issuing the **“Acta de Assembleia”** that will be filed with the **Junta Comercial** and the **Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM)**. |\n| **Precedent** | The 2023 merger of **TOTVS S.A.** with a Chilean SaaS provider was executed under Brazilian law (Lei 6.404) with the merger seat in Brazil, despite the target having subsidiaries in Chile and Mexico. The transaction was approved by CADE and the data‑protection authorities in each jurisdiction. |\n\n*Alternative seats (Luxembourg, Chile, Mexico) are technically possible but would require a **“reverse merger”** (foreign surviving entity) that is **not permitted under Brazilian law** for a Brazilian public company and would create additional layers of foreign‑exchange and tax compliance.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Conflict‑of‑Law Considerations  \n\n| Issue | Brazil | Chile | Mexico |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Applicable Corporate Law** | Lei 6.404/1976 (Sociedades por Ações) – governs the merger, shareholder approvals, and post‑merger restructuring. | Ley 28.046 (Sociedad Anónima) – governs the Chilean subsidiary’s merger into the Brazilian surviving entity (via “incorporación por fusión”). | Ley General de Sociedades Mercantiles (LGSM) – governs the Mexican subsidiary’s merger (via “fusión por absorción”). |\n| **Choice‑of‑Law Clause** | The merger act must state that **Brazilian law governs the merger** (Art. 108 of Lei 6.404). Foreign subsidiaries will be merged **by reference** (i.e., their assets and liabilities are transferred to the Brazilian surviving entity). |\n| **Recognition of Foreign Merger** | Brazilian courts recognise foreign mergers if the foreign law provides **substantive equivalence** (e.g., protection of minority shareholders, registration of the merger). The merger must be **registered** in Brazil; the foreign subsidiaries’ merger documents must be **apostilled** and **translated** into Portuguese. |\n| **Cross‑Border Insolvency/Bankruptcy** | Brazil is a signatory to the **UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross‑Border Insolvency**; however, the merger should be completed **before** any insolvency risk materialises. |\n| **Tax Residence Conflict** | The new holding will be tax‑resident in Brazil (central management located in Brazil). The Luxembourg vehicle will be a **non‑resident shareholder**; the DTTs will apply based on the **beneficial‑owner** test. |\n| **Data‑Protection Conflict** | The merger will trigger **LGPD (Brazil)**, **Ley 19.628 (Chile)**, and **LFPDPPP (Mexico)**. The “controller” of personal data after the merger will be the **Brazilian surviving entity**; however, each jurisdiction’s regulator may still require **local processing agreements** and **cross‑border data‑transfer mechanisms** (Standard Contractual Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules). |\n\n**Practical Guidance**  \n\n1. **Draft a “Merger Agreement”** that expressly states:  \n   - The merger is governed by Brazilian law (Lei 6.404).  \n   - The Chilean and Mexican subsidiaries are **absorbed** by the Brazilian surviving entity.  \n   - All shareholder approvals are obtained in accordance with each local law.  \n2. **Include a “Choice‑of‑Law & Jurisdiction” clause** that designates the **São Paulo Court of Justice** for any disputes, with a **mandatory arbitration** clause (ICC) for intra‑group matters.  \n3. **Prepare “Apostille‑Certified Translations”** of Chilean and Mexican corporate resolutions, articles of incorporation, and shareholder registers.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. How the Three Corporate Statutes Apply  \n\n| Statute | Core Provision Relevant to Cross‑Border Merger | Practical Effect |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Lei 6.404/1976 (Brazil)** – Art. 108‑112 | Allows a Brazilian corporation to **merge with foreign entities** (fusões transnacionais). Requires: <br>• Board resolution authorising the merger.<br>• Shareholder approval (majority of voting rights and at least 2/3 of the capital, unless the bylaws provide otherwise).<br>• Publication of the merger notice in the **Diário Oficial** and a **major newspaper**.<br>• Registration with the **Junta Comercial** and, if listed, the **CVM**. | The Brazilian surviving entity (BrazilCo) will be the **legal acquirer**. The merger will be recorded in the **Junta Comercial de São Paulo** (or the state where BrazilCo is incorporated). |\n| **Ley 28.046 (Chile)** – Art. 71‑78 (Fusión por absorción) | A Chilean **Sociedad Anónima (SpA)** may be **absorbed** by a foreign corporation if: <br>• The foreign corporation is incorporated under a law that provides **equivalent shareholder protection**.<br>• The merger is approved by **≥ 2/3 of the shareholders** (or as per the bylaws).<br>• The merger is **registered** in the **Registro de Comercio**. | The Chilean SpA will **cease to exist**; its assets and liabilities will be transferred to BrazilCo. The merger must be **published** in the **Diario Oficial** and a **newspaper of general circulation** in Chile. |\n| **Ley General de Sociedades Mercantiles (México)** – Art. 115‑124 (Fusión por absorción) | A Mexican **Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S. de R.L. de C.V.)** may be merged into a foreign corporation if: <br>• The foreign corporation’s law provides **similar shareholder rights**.<br>• The merger is approved by **≥ 2/3 of the capital** (or as stipulated).<br>• The merger is recorded in the **Public Registry of Commerce**. | The Mexican subsidiary will be **dissolved** upon transfer of assets to BrazilCo. A **“Acta de Asamblea”** must be filed with the **Registro Público de la Propiedad y del Comercio**. |\n\n**Key Harmonisation Points**  \n\n- All three statutes require **minimum 2/3 shareholder approval** (or higher if bylaws dictate).  \n- **Public notice** is mandatory in each jurisdiction – coordinate publication dates to satisfy the longest statutory period (Brazil: 15 days after notice; Chile: 10 days; Mexico: 10 days).  \n- **Minority‑shareholder protection**: Brazil’s “opção de compra” (right of dissent) may be triggered; Chile and Mexico have similar “derecho de preferencia”. Plan for **cash-out** or **share‑exchange** mechanisms.  \n\n---\n\n## 5.
