{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 1, \"reasoning\": \"The candidate answer explicitly discusses the arguments related to the injunction and jurisdiction/due process defenses under Article V. In section 6, under the heading 'Overlapping jurisdictions and scholarly/comparative positions supporting deference,' the candidate lists several key scholarly texts on international arbitration, including Gary Born, Van den Berg, and Redfern & Hunter, which are standard references when discussing the pro-enforcement bias and deference under the New York Convention. While the criterion specifically asks about Article VII, the response heavily focuses on the pro-enforcement policy and deference under Article V, which is the core of the enforcement defense strategy. However, upon strict review, the response *does not* mention Article VII of the New York Convention, which permits parties to invoke more favorable domestic enforcement rules. Since the criterion specifically requires mentioning Article VII, and it is absent, the criterion is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"78fd18d0-9c23-4147-855e-44a9ee3a1b64\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3160, "completion_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 3387}, "latency_s": 1.8622354160179384, "request_id": "VBqVaeOBMaOF7M8P9PzH6Ag", "raw_response": null}
