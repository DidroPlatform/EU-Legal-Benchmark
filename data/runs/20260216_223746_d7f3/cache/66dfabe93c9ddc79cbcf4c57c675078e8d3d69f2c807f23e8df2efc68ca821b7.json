English courts have developed a sophisticated framework for this exact scenario.\n\n## Key Principles\n\n**The injunction can proceed because:**\n\n1. **Freezing orders are procedural, not substantive** - they don't determine the underlying dispute, just preserve assets pending resolution\n2. **They support, rather than undermine, arbitration** - preventing dissipation of assets that might satisfy an eventual award\n3. **Section 44 of the Arbitration Act 1996** explicitly allows English courts to grant interim relief in support of foreign arbitrations\n\n## The Balancing Test\n\nEnglish courts apply these considerations:\n\n### In Favor of Granting the Injunction:\n- **Risk of dissipation** - evidence the defendant might move/hide assets\n- **Connection to England** - assets or business presence in the UK\n- **Supporting arbitration** - the order facilitates rather than frustrates the arbitral process\n- **Urgency** - arbitral tribunals may not be constituted yet or lack immediate enforcement power\n\n### Against Granting:\n- **Comity concerns** - respecting the arbitral tribunal's primary jurisdiction\n- **The arbitration agreement itself** - courts honor parties' choice of dispute resolution forum\n- **Forum shopping** - whether the applicant is trying to circumvent the arbitration\n\n## Practical Requirements\n\nThe applicant must typically show:\n\n- **A good arguable case** on the merits\n- **Assets within the jurisdiction** (or defendants subject to personal jurisdiction)\n- **Real risk of dissipation**\n- **The arbitration clause doesn't prohibit court intervention** for interim measures\n\n## Leading Authority\n\nThe **Ust-Kamenogorsk principle** (from a 2013 case) confirms that arbitration agreements don't automatically prevent freezing injunctions - the court retains discretion where:\n- The order supports rather than supplants arbitration\n- There's no alternative effective remedy\n- Granting relief doesn't breach the arbitration agreement\n\n## Singapore Arbitration Specifics\n\nWith Singapore arbitration specifically:\n- English courts recognize Singapore as a respected arbitral seat\n- They're more willing to grant support knowing Singapore courts will enforce awards\n- The **Singapore International Arbitration Act** also permits court-ordered interim measures, creating parallel frameworks\n\n## Potential Complications\n\n**Watch for:**\n- **Express wording** in the arbitration clause prohibiting court intervention\n- **Institutional rules** (SIAC, ICC, etc.) that may affect the analysis\n- **Anti-suit injunction risks** - the Singapore tribunal might order the English proceedings stopped\n- **Enforcement issues** - whether the freezing order can practically be enforced\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nThe English courts will likely uphold the freezing injunction **unless** the arbitration agreement expressly prohibits it or there's no legitimate need for court intervention. The test is whether the injunction supports or subverts the arbitration process - and asset preservation typically supports it.\n\nThe key is demonstrating that you're seeking the court's unique coercive powers (asset freezing) while respecting the arbitrator's role in deciding the substantive dispute.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 59, "completion_tokens": 723, "total_tokens": 782}, "latency_s": 16.986798584024655, "request_id": "chatcmpl-6b4a950e-874f-4311-8551-e0abac5fab44", "raw_response": null}
