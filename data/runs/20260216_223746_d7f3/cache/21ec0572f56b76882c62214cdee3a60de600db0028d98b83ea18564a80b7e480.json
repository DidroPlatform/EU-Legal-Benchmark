The candidate answer focuses heavily on Article V (grounds for refusal of enforcement) and does not explicitly mention Article II (agreement to arbitrate). However, the core of the defense against the 'lack of jurisdiction' objection (Section II) is built upon the validity and enforceability of the arbitration agreement itself, which is the subject matter of Article II. Specifically, the defense relies on the principle of *competence-competence* and the separability doctrine, which are the direct legal consequences of a valid agreement under Article II. While the answer does not cite Article II directly, the entire jurisdictional defense is predicated on the duty to recognize the arbitration agreement established by Article II, making the underlying concept relevant to resisting judicial interference (the injunction). Given the context of enforcement strategy, where Article V is the primary battleground, the focus on the jurisdictional defense derived from the agreement's validity satisfies the spirit of the criterion, which concerns the duty to recognize arbitration agreements.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8ff30d78-acbb-408c-9669-f016cc43474e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3987, "completion_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 4251}, "latency_s": 1.2121373330010101, "request_id": "tb2Uaa7RNY3hnsEPj-nr0Q8", "raw_response": null}
