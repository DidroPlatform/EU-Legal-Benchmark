The candidate answer discusses Section 163(j) and earnings-stripping rules, which are the modern U.S. statutory limitations on interest deductions, but it does not explicitly mention the common law 'thin capitalization doctrine,' which is a distinct concept often relevant in international tax contexts, especially concerning foreign jurisdictions or pre-TCJA U.S. law. Since the criterion specifically asks for the mention of the 'thin capitalization doctrine,' and the answer only mentions the statutory rules (163(j)), it does not strictly satisfy the requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8fdccc9f-9087-40ec-b39f-52d653aca87b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1979, "completion_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 2168}, "latency_s": 0.8390937920194119, "request_id": "0vKUadzMEoTensEP6bbt4Ac", "raw_response": null}
