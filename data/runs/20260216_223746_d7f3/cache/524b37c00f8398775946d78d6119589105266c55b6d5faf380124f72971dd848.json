{"provider": "nim", "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", "text": " Based on the facts you've described, your legal position is **precarious but not necessarily hopeless**—though the six-month absence significantly weakens your claim. Here is a breakdown of the likely legal analysis:\n\n### 1. Your Occupancy Status (The Foundation of Your Rights)\nThe fact that you have not paid rent for 10 years does not automatically mean you have no rights, but it makes your status ambiguous:\n\n*   **If you were a Tenant (AST or Periodic Tenancy):** Even without a written contract or rent payments, if there was ever an agreement that you could live there exclusively in return for services, caretaking, or \"peppercorn\" rent, you likely have an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) or a statutory periodic tenancy. The new buyer **steps into the shoes of the old landlord** and inherits your tenancy. They cannot simply tell you to leave; they must serve a Section 21 or Section 8 notice and obtain a court order for possession.\n*   **If you were a Bare Licensee:** If the arrangement was purely permissive (e.g., you were a friend or family member staying as a favor), you are likely a \"bare licensee.\" While this is revocable, it requires **reasonable notice** (which, after 10 years, would likely be weeks or months, not immediate).\n*   **If you were a \"Property Guardian\":** If this was a guardian scheme, your rights are minimal, but you still require proper notice.\n\n### 2. The Critical Problem: Abandonment (Non-Occupation)\nYour six-month absence creates a strong argument for **abandonment** (implied surrender):\n*   In English law, if a tenant leaves a property for a significant period without paying rent and without communication, the landlord may argue the tenancy was surrendered by \"abandonment.\"\n*   **However**, leaving your belongings behind is strong evidence of your **intention to return**, which generally prevents abandonment.\n*   **Your silence was a mistake:** Ignoring the buyer’s text message asking if you were still living there could be interpreted by a court as evidence that you had, in fact, abandoned the property. It suggests you were not exercising your right to occupy.\n\n### 3. The Sale Itself\n*   If you had a valid tenancy at the time of sale, the new owner purchases the property **\"subject to\"** your tenancy. They cannot evict you without following proper procedure.\n*   However, if the previous landlord (and now the new owner) believed the property was vacant or abandoned, the sale may have proceeded on that basis. The new buyer is now likely claiming you are a **trespasser** (squatter).\n\n### 4. Immediate Risks\n*   **Illegal Eviction:** If you return to the UK and find the locks changed or your belongings removed, this is a criminal offense under the **Protection from Eviction Act 1977**. Even if you are a trespasser, the new owner must use court procedures to remove you (though this is faster for trespassers than tenants).\n*   **Adverse Possession?** After 10 years, you might wonder about \"squatter's rights.\" However, because you entered with the landlord's **permission**, you cannot claim adverse possession (which requires 10 years of *unauthorized* occupation). Your permission likely ended when you left for Asia, but you cannot \"switch\" to an adverse possession claim while you were initially permitted to be there.\n\n### Immediate Steps You Must Take\n\n1.  **Return to the UK immediately** (if possible). Physical presence is your strongest evidence that you have not abandoned the property.\n2.  **Contact the new owner urgently** (in writing/email, keeping records). Explain that:\n    *   You have been the lawful occupier for 10 years.\n    *   You were temporarily abroad for work but maintained your residence (your belongings prove this).\n    *   You did not abandon the property.\n    *   You require proper notice if they wish to terminate your occupancy.\n3.  **Gather evidence:** Find any old messages, emails, or witnesses proving your 10-year occupation and any agreement with the previous landlord (even if informal).\n4.  **Seek emergency legal advice:**\n    *   Contact **Shelter** (shelter.org.uk or 0808 800 4444) immediately.\n    *   Contact a housing solicitor. Given the complexity (10-year history, 6-month gap, sale completion), you need professional representation to argue against abandonment.\n    *   If the new owner has already changed the locks, contact the police (illegal eviction) and a solicitor immediately.\n\n### Summary\nYou likely had a form of tenancy or license that required formal notice to end, **but** your six-month absence and failure to respond to the buyer puts you in a dangerous position where the new owner will claim you are a trespasser. You need to re-establish physical possession and legal representation **now** to avoid being locked out permanently.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 153, "completion_tokens": 2467, "total_tokens": 2620}, "latency_s": 160.89436312500038, "request_id": "chatcmpl-a71cc148c71f646f", "raw_response": null}
