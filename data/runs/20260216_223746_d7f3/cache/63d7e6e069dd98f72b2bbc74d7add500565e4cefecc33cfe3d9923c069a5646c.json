The candidate answer focuses heavily on the PE risk in Singapore (dependent agent PE) and the anti-abuse risk (PPT) under the NL-SG treaty, which would deny the treaty benefit. It does not explicitly state the condition required by the criterion: that the LP *can* obtain the benefit *if* the CV avoids a UK PE. Furthermore, the core analysis suggests the treaty benefit is 'fragile' due to PPT and the primary PE risk is in Singapore, not the UK, making the premise of the criterion (avoiding a UK PE being the key to obtaining the benefit) secondary or potentially misleading in this specific structure.\", \"criterion_id\": \"41118527-14e6-443d-a588-f584d629adec\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1195, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 1409}, "latency_s": 0.8504348330025095, "request_id": "j9aUadrqMI3hnsEPj-nr0Q8", "raw_response": null}
