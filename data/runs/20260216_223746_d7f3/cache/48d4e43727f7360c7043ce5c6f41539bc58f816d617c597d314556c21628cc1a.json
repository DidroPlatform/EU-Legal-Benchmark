The candidate answer discusses the truck driver's liability extensively, concluding that the chain remains intact and the truck driver is likely to be treated as a contributing cause, but it does not explicitly state the premise required by the criterion: that the truck driver's actions were 'at least negligent' as a prerequisite for liability, nor does it explicitly state the conclusion in the required conditional form ('if the drunk driver's actions are not considered an intervening cause, the truck driver will likely be found at least partially liable').
