The candidate answer explicitly discusses the risk that a dependent agent PE in Singapore 'kills the treaty benefit entirely' and that if a dependent agent PE exists, 'the treaty doesn't apply to those profits at all'. Furthermore, it discusses HMRC challenging the structure under PPT, which would also deny treaty benefits. This directly addresses the possibility of treaty denial based on a PE assertion (in Singapore) or other grounds (PPT, which is a common challenge when PE is asserted or suspected).\", \"criterion_id\": \"5d6ef8a4-5c02-47c4-af80-dcacf4655e93\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1183, "completion_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 1358}, "latency_s": 0.9477668330073357, "request_id": "dtaUafSTNarw7M8Pw5-qsA8", "raw_response": null}
