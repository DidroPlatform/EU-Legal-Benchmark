INCORRECT. Legal sociologists use empirical/descriptive methods to observe societal phenomena. They do NOT first prescribe a normative end. That would be more characteristic of legal philosophy/normative jurisprudence. Sociology of law is descriptive, not prescriptive.\\n\\nii. INCORRECT. Under Republican Roman law, treasure found on alien property was split - typically the finder got half and the landowner got half (this was established by Hadrian's rule). The statement says it 'quite likely belonged entirely to the landowner,' which is incorrect. Actually, under early Republican law, treasure (thesaurus) found on another's land belonged to the finder according to some accounts, or was disputed. Hadrian later established the half-and-half rule. The statement saying it 'quite likely belonged entirely to the landowner' is incorrect.\\n\\niii. INCORRECT. Carl Stooss was a Swiss criminal law reformer who drafted the Swiss Penal Code. He was known for advocating a modern approach that included preventive measures (Massnahmen/measures) alongside punishments. He did NOT advocate purely retributive sanctions - quite the opposite, he was a pioneer of the dual-track system (Zweispurigkeit) combining punishment and preventive measures.\\n\\niv. This statement about abstract/direct vs. concrete/indirect judicial review is generally correct in Swiss constitutional law. In abstract review, successful challenge leads to annulment of the legislation. In concrete review, only the specific application/administrative decision is set aside, not the underlying law.\\n\\nv. The Responsible Business Initiative aimed to create liability for Swiss-based companies for human rights and environmental violations by their subsidiaries abroad. This would have changed Swiss commercial/corporate law. This statement appears correct in describing what the initiative would have done.\\n\\nSo statements i, ii, and iii are incorrect, while iv and v are correct.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 563, "completion_tokens": 437, "total_tokens": 1000}, "latency_s": 10.935839624988148, "request_id": "chatcmpl-10ff6244-281c-438d-b45f-1e6f3819c790", "raw_response": null}
