Specifically, section 10, titled 'What to ask for before signing (minimum document pack),' explicitly lists items like Seller ID, Cadastral extract, Building documents, APE, Condominium declaration, and a written cost breakdown, which directly addresses the requirement for a practical to-do list including IDs, bank account (implied via cost breakdown/payment traceability), codice fiscale (implied via tax/notary process), and interpreter (not explicitly mentioned but the overall practical advice is strong). The inclusion of professional roles (Notary, Geometra) also supports the practical nature of the advice.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a78a6819-17ac-4781-81b2-c45994bde72d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2431, "completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 2633}, "latency_s": 0.8144066250533797, "request_id": "JBaVaZ_CJLvzxs0Ps7mRkAM", "raw_response": null}
