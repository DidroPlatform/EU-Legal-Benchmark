{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"score\": 0.4, \"pass\": false, \"rationale\": \"The candidate answer attempts to address the prompt by applying Swiss corporate law to the Friedman statement. However, the task instructions and reference answer clearly indicate that the expected discussion should revolve around general corporate law theories, specifically shareholder wealth maximization versus the social institution model/CSR debate, referencing concepts like Parkinson's model, Janet Dine's article, and historical context. The reference answer explicitly lists these theoretical components as necessary for a complete response.\\n\\nThe candidate answer fails to engage with the core theoretical debate outlined in the reference answer (shareholder primacy vs. stakeholder/social institution model). Instead, it pivots entirely to a specific jurisdiction (Swiss Law) and cites specific articles of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO). While this demonstrates legal knowledge, it does not fulfill the requirements of discussing the *topics covered in the course* as implied by the reference answer's focus on established corporate governance theories (e.g., agency theory vs. stakeholder theory).\\n\\nSpecifically, the candidate misses:\\n1. Discussion of the purpose of the corporation debate.\\n2. Comparison of shareholder wealth maximization vs. social institution model.\\n3. Mention of key theoretical concepts/authors listed in the reference (Parkinson, Dine).\\n4. Discussion of whether companies should be required to state a purpose.\\n\\nBecause the answer completely ignores the required theoretical framework and substitutes it with a jurisdiction-specific analysis, it scores poorly against the reference guidance.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.4}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1871, "completion_tokens": 319, "total_tokens": 2190}, "latency_s": 1.25670920900302, "request_id": "IwOVadPPFo-VkdUPpZbhqAk", "raw_response": null}
