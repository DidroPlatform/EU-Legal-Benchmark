The candidate explicitly discusses several mandatory enforcement mechanisms under the section 'Enforcement Mechanisms That Strengthen Compliance,' including: 1) Financial Penalties, 2) Mandatory Audits (citing the EU Directive requiring audits for gaps >5% and Iceland's certification via audits), and 3) Public Shaming/Market Pressure. While it doesn't explicitly use the term 'algorithmic bias auditing,' mandatory pay equity audits (as proposed in the EU Directive and implemented in Iceland) serve a similar function of mandatory, systematic review of pay structures, which is a strong fulfillment of the spirit of the criterion. Furthermore, the discussion of pay transparency laws (like those in California and Colorado) inherently involves mandatory salary disclosure on job advertisements, which is listed as an example in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"71239f09-3c08-4b68-ad2a-00016917f4aa\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1921, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 2155}, "latency_s": 1.4917522500036284, "request_id": "ADOVaYqzO9z07M8PwPSugQU", "raw_response": null}
