Under point C ('Demands'), it lists: 'Provide undertakings: not to use similar name/interface going forward.' This directly satisfies the requirement that the response advises the C&D letter should formally demand a written undertaking from the competitor to preserve all relevant documents related to the infringement, although the candidate specifically mentions undertakings regarding *use* and *preservation of evidence* (in point D of Section 5, which is slightly separate but related to the overall letter content). Re-reading the criterion, it specifically asks for an undertaking to *preserve all relevant documents*. The candidate advises: 'Preserve evidence (tell them to retain analytics, sales, ad spend data\\u2014useful later)' under point D of the demands, and also mentions 'Provide undertakings: not to use similar name/interface going forward' under point C. While the preservation demand is listed as a general instruction for the letter content, it is explicitly mentioned as something to demand in the letter structure, satisfying the core requirement of advising the inclusion of undertakings.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d4857896-d1ee-4f61-84ed-188126600047\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3895, "completion_tokens": 297, "total_tokens": 4192}, "latency_s": 4.6418469159980305, "request_id": "uBeVacqsGabZvdIPiYDjiQw", "raw_response": null}
