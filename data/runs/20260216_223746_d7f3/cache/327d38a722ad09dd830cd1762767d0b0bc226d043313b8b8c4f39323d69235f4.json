Furthermore, the section 'Treaty Benefit Hold-Up (NL-SG DTA for CV)' discusses the risk of denial under the MLI PPT, which is a mechanism often used by treaty partners (like Singapore) to deny benefits when the structure's principal purpose is tax avoidance, which is directly related to the PE risk assertion in the context of treaty shopping.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5d6ef8a4-5c02-47c4-af80-dcacf4655e93\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1058, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 1274}, "latency_s": 0.7794118330348283, "request_id": "WiOVadjkMrzhnsEPwLCgiQY", "raw_response": null}
