The advice assumes the cartoon character is original, fixed in a video series, and that your client (or his company) already owns the copyright (and, ideally, any related trademarks).  If any of those assumptions are missing, the first step is to secure the appropriate registrations.\n\n---\n\n## 1. QUICK FACT‑CHECK\n\n| Fact | Why it matters |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Original cartoon series** (video, drawings, scripts) | Copyright subsists automatically in Italy (Art. 2‑c of the Italian Copyright Law – **L. 633/1941**) and the U.S. (17 U.S.C. § 102). |\n| **Character is distinctive & used as a brand** | May also be protected by **trademark** (EU Trade Mark Regulation, Italian Law 22/2006). |\n| **Shirts are being sold in Rome** | Infringement occurs **where the infringing act is performed** – i.e., Italy. |\n| **Four variants**: (a) “normal outfit”, (b) “crazy sunglasses”, (c) “worker‑rights activist outfit”, (d) “parody of a show joke” | Different legal analyses (straight copy vs. derivative work vs. parody). |\n| **Your client is a U.S. national** | He can enforce rights abroad, but must do so **through local (Italian) procedures** or via international treaties (Berne, TRIPS). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN ITALY\n\n| Area | Key Statutes / Treaties | Core Protection |\n|------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Copyright** | Italian Law 633/1941 (as amended), **Berne Convention**, **EU InfoSoc Directive** (2001/29/EC) | Exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, communicate to the public, and create **derivative works**. |\n| **Moral rights** | Art. 12‑15 of Law 633/1941 (non‑waivable, perpetual) | Right of attribution, integrity, and to object to derogatory treatments. |\n| **Trademark** | EU Trade Mark Regulation (Reg. 207/2009), Italian Law 22/2006 | Exclusive right to use the mark on goods/services; can block “confusingly similar” merch. |\n| **Parody exception** | Art. 70 of Law 633/1941 (mirroring EU Directive Art. 5(3)(a) – “quotation for criticism, review or parody”) | Allows limited use **provided it is a genuine parody, does not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work, and does not cause unjustified prejudice** to the author. |\n| **Criminal infringement** | Art. 633 of the Italian Penal Code (penalties up to 3 years imprisonment + fines) | Applies when infringement is “commercial” and on a large scale. |\n| **Customs & border measures** | EU Customs Regulation 1383/2003 (right to request seizure of infringing goods) | Useful if the shirts are imported from abroad. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. WHAT YOU CAN DO IN ITALY\n\n### 3.1. **Gather & Preserve Evidence**\n\n| Action | How |\n|--------|-----|\n| **Photograph every shirt** (front, back, tags, price, location). | High‑resolution images, date‑stamped. |\n| **Collect receipts / sales data** (if possible). | Ask vendors for invoices, or use “mystery shopper” to obtain proof of sale. |\n| **Record video of the stall(s)** (including signage, surrounding environment). | Shows public display. |\n| **Identify the vendor(s)** (name, address, tax ID, bank details). | Use local “Registro delle Imprese” (Chamber of Commerce) or ask the vendor directly. |\n| **Document online presence** (if the shirts are also sold on Instagram, Facebook, Etsy, etc.). | Screenshots, URLs, timestamps. |\n| **Check for trademark registrations** (EUIPO, Italian Patent & Trademark Office). | If none exist, file a **trademark application** ASAP (see § 4). |\n\n### 3.2. **Determine the Legal Theory for Each Variant**\n\n| Variant | Likely infringement | Likely defenses |\n|---------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| **(a) Normal outfit** – exact copy of the cartoon character | **Straight copyright infringement** (reproduction & distribution). | None (unless the vendor can prove independent creation, which is unlikely). |\n| **(b) Crazy sunglasses** – minor visual alteration | **Derivative work** (Art. 6‑c, 6‑d). Still infringement because the underlying protected expression is copied. | None (minor changes do not create a new work). |\n| **(c) Worker‑rights activist outfit** – “political” re‑dress | **Derivative work** (still infringing). May attempt **parody** defense, but Italian courts require the parody to be **recognizable as a joke or critique** of the original, not merely a “political appropriation”. | Parody is possible only if the new work **comments on the original**; a mere “political costume” is unlikely to qualify. |\n| **(d) Warped version mocking a show joke** | **Parody** (potentially protected under Art. 70). Must meet three tests: (1) **parodic purpose**, (2) **no conflict with normal exploitation**, (3) **no undue prejudice**. | If the parody is **clearly a joke** that targets the original, it may be allowed. However, commercial exploitation (selling shirts) weighs against a fair‑use defense. Italian courts have been **reluctant** to treat commercial merchandise as a permissible parody. |\n\n### 3.3. **Immediate Enforcement Tools**\n\n| Tool | When to Use | Practical Steps |\n|------|-------------|-----------------|\n| **Cease‑and‑Desist Letter (formal notice)** | First‑hand, low‑cost, often effective. | Draft in Italian (or bilingual). Cite: (i) copyright ownership, (ii) specific infringing acts, (iii) demand removal & destruction of inventory within a set deadline (e.g., 10 days), (iv) warn of civil/criminal action. |\n| **DMCA‑style takedown (for online sales)** | If shirts are listed on platforms (Etsy, Amazon, Instagram). | Use the platform’s “IP infringement” procedure; Italian law recognizes similar “notice‑and‑take‑down” obligations. |\n| **Customs seizure request** | If shirts are imported from outside the EU. | File a request with **Italian Customs** (via the “IPR Right‑Holder” portal) attaching proof of registration and evidence of infringement. |\n| **Criminal complaint** | When the scale is large, organized, or the vendor is a repeat offender. | File a complaint with the **Polizia di Stato** or **Guardia di Finanza**; they can open a criminal investigation under Art. 633 CP. |\n| **Civil injunction & damages** | If the vendor refuses to comply. | File a **preliminary injunction** (ordinanza ingiuntiva) in the **Tribunale** of the jurisdiction where the vendor operates. Seek: (i) **injunctive relief** (stop sales), (ii) **destruction of infringing goods**, (iii) **accounting of profits**, (iv) **statutory damages** (up to € 5 million for willful infringement). |\n| **Trademark enforcement** | If you have a registered EU/Italian trademark for the character. | Send a **trademark cease‑and‑desist**; file a **trademark infringement action** (separate from copyright). |\n| **Settlement / Licensing** | If you prefer a quick resolution. | Offer a **limited‑term license** (e.g., 5 % royalty) in exchange for a written agreement and removal of unauthorized copies. |\n\n### 3.4. **Procedural Checklist for Italy**\n\n1. **Confirm ownership** – locate the original registration (U.S. copyright registration, if any, is persuasive evidence in Italy under the Berne Convention).  \n2. **Register the character in Italy/EU** (optional but strengthens enforcement):  \n   * **Copyright** – not required, but you can file a “deposit” with the **SIAE** (Italian Society of Authors and Publishers) for evidentiary purposes.  \n   * **Trademark** – file a **EU Trade Mark** (Class 25 for clothing) covering the visual representation of the character.  \n3. **Engage local counsel** – an Italian IP attorney can draft the cease‑and‑desist, file the injunction, and liaise with authorities.  \n4. **Send the first‑step notice** (CEASE‑AND‑DESIST).  \n5. **If no response**, proceed with **customs seizure** (if applicable) and **file a civil claim** for injunction & damages.  \n6. **Consider criminal complaint** if the vendor is part of a larger “piracy ring”.  \n7. **Monitor** – set up Google Alerts, watch local markets, and periodically check online marketplaces.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. TRADEMARK STRATEGY (EU/Italy)\n\nEven if the copyright claim is the primary weapon, a **trademark** can block “confusingly similar” merchandise and give you a **broader basis for injunctions**.\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| **Search** | Conduct a clearance search on **EUIPO** and **Ufficio Italiano Brevetti e Marchi (UIBM)** for existing marks that might conflict. |\n| **File** | Submit an **EU Trade Mark** (or Italian national mark) in **Class 25 (clothing)** and **Class 41 (entertainment services)**. Include a **graphical representation** of the character (full‑color, multiple poses). |\n| **Use** | Begin “use in commerce” (sell official merch, post on the website) to secure the **priority** and avoid “non‑use” cancellation. |\n| **Enforce** | Use the trademark claim to demand removal of any **non‑licensed** shirts that **use the same visual representation** or a **confusingly similar** version. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. “WHAT IF” THE SAME SHIRTS SHOW UP IN THE UNITED STATES?\n\n### 5.1. Legal Landscape in the U.S.\n\n| Issue | Governing Law | Key Points |\n|-------|---------------|------------|\n| **Copyright infringement** | 17 U.S.C. § 106 (exclusive rights) + **DMCA** (17 U.S.C. § 512) | Reproduction, distribution, and public display of the character on shirts without permission is infringing. |\n| **Fair use (parody)** | 17 U.S.C. § 107 (four‑factor test) | Parody is a recognized defense, but **commercial sale of T‑shirts** is heavily weighed against fair use. Courts require the parody to **comment on the original work**, not merely use it for humor. |\n| **Trademark infringement** | Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1114, § 1125) | If the character is a registered trademark (or has acquired “secondary meaning”), unauthorized use on clothing can cause **confusion** and be actionable. |\n| **First Sale Doctrine** | 17 U.S.C. § 109(a) | Allows resale of lawfully made copies, **but does not protect** the initial unauthorized *manufacture* of the shirts. |\n| **Criminal copyright infringement** | 18 U.S.C. § 2319 | Applies when the infringement is **willful** and for **commercial advantage**; rarely used for a few shirts but possible if a large operation is uncovered. |\n\n### 5.2. Practical Enforcement Steps in the U.S.\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| **1. Identify the infringer** | Use Amazon/Shopify seller info, subpoena records if needed. |\n| **2. Send a DMCA takedown** | To the platform (e‑bay, Etsy, Instagram, etc.). Include a **copyright registration number** (U.S. registration is mandatory for statutory damages). |\n| **3. Cease‑and‑Desist Letter** | Draft in English, cite 17 U.S.C. § 501 (copyright) and Lanham Act. Demand removal, destruction, and an accounting of profits. |\n| **4. File a civil lawsuit** | In the **U.S. District Court** where the infringer resides or does business. Seek: (i) **preliminary injunction**, (ii) **actual damages** + **profits**, (iii) **statutory damages** (up to $150,000 per work for willful infringement), (iv) **attorney’s fees**. |\n| **5. Consider criminal referral** | If the operation is large‑scale, coordinate with the **U.S. Copyright Office** and **FBI**. |\n| **6. Trademark action** | If you have a registered trademark, file a **Lanham Act infringement** claim (often combined with the copyright suit). |\n| **7. Customs seizure** | Register the U.S. copyright/trademark with **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)** to block importation of infringing shirts. |\n\n### 5.3. Parody Defense – U.S. vs. Italy\n\n| Factor | U.S. (Fair Use) | Italy (Art. 70) |\n|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Purpose** | Parody must **comment on the original**; commercial use is not per se fatal but is a negative factor. | Parody allowed if it is a **“genuine parody”** that comments on the original; commercial exploitation is tolerated only if the parody is clear and does not cause “unjustified prejudice”. |\n| **Amount used** | Must be **no more than necessary** to conjure the original. | No explicit “amount” test, but the *essence* of the work may not be appropriated beyond what is needed for the parody. |\n| **Effect on market** | If the parody **substitutes** the original or harms its market, fair use fails. | Same principle – if the parody **competes** with the author’s normal exploitation, it is less likely to be protected. |\n| **Outcome** | Courts (e.g., *Campbell v. Acuff‑Rockwell*, *Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin*) often **deny fair use** for merchandise that is primarily a profit‑making product. | Italian courts have been **more protective of the author’s moral rights**; commercial parody on clothing is rarely successful. |\n\n**Bottom line:** A shirt that merely “mocks a joke” but is sold for profit is **unlikely to qualify as a protected parody** in either jurisdiction.  The safest route is to treat all four variants as **infringement** and pursue enforcement.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

KEY TAKE‑AWAYS FOR YOUR CLIENT\n\n1. **Act quickly** – the longer the shirts stay on the market, the harder it is to claim “unjustified prejudice”.  \n2. **Use local counsel** – an Italian IP attorney can draft the proper notices, file injunctions, and liaise with customs/police.  \n3. **Leverage both copyright **and** trademark** – the dual‑layer approach gives you more leverage and broader injunctive relief.  \n4. **Document everything** – courts (both Italian and U.S.) rely heavily on contemporaneous evidence.  \n5. **Consider a licensing compromise** only if the infringer is willing to pay a reasonable royalty; otherwise, a **zero‑tolerance** stance (destruction of goods, damages) is advisable to protect the brand’s integrity.  \n6. **Register the character** (EU trademark, optional SIAE deposit) **now** if you haven’t already; this will make future enforcement smoother.  \n7. **Monitor the market** continuously (Google Alerts, local “street‑level” checks in tourist areas, and online marketplace watchlists).  \n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation\n\n- **Immediate**: Have your client’s U.S. counsel retain an Italian IP firm. Provide them with all evidence and the copyright registration (U.S. registration is persuasive evidence in Italy).  \n- **Within 5‑7 days**: Issue a bilingual cease‑and‑desist to each vendor, demanding removal of all infringing shirts and destruction of inventory.  \n-", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 214, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 4310}, "latency_s": 16.946870040992508, "request_id": "chatcmpl-bd479627-56ad-46a2-920a-7d70967557eb", "raw_response": null}
