The candidate answer discusses the shift in the burden of proof for goods moving from GB to NI (Green Lane vs. Red Lane) and explicitly mentions that goods moving through the Green Lane are presumed NOT at risk unless they are subject to commercial processing in NI (referencing the original Protocol's language in the context of the shift). Specifically, under the original Protocol, a good was at risk unless it could be shown that it would not be \\\"subject to commercial processing in Northern Ireland\\\". The candidate answer states: \\\"Under the original Protocol (Article 5(2) and Joint Committee Decision No 1/2020 of 17 December 2020): A good was considered \\\"at risk\\\" of entering the EU single market unless it could be shown that it would not be \\\\\\\"subject to commercial processing in Northern Ireland\\\\\\\" and met certain criteria.\\\" This directly addresses the concept that processing matters for determining risk status under the old rules. However, the core of the Windsor Framework change is that for Green Lane goods, the presumption is reversed, meaning the focus shifts to whether the goods are *destined* for the EU, rather than whether they will be processed. The answer explains the *old* rule which included processing, but it does not clearly articulate how the *new* framework treats goods that are processed in NI but destined for the EU (which would fall into the Red Lane and be subject to full EU checks, meaning they are definitively 'at risk'). The explanation focuses heavily on the GB-to-NI movement and the reversal of the burden of proof, rather than explicitly confirming that processing within NI is a key component of the 'at risk' definition that triggers Red Lane treatment or tariff liability, as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"fc71b680-fd6e-4d06-9a32-d540462c9927\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4161, "completion_tokens": 443, "total_tokens": 4604}, "latency_s": 1.8173185420164373, "request_id": "x8SUaaCTNP3onsEP3cCnyQM", "raw_response": null}
