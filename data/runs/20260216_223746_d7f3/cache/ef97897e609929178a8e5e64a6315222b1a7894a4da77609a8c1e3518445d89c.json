The candidate answer addresses this directly in Section 1 (Article III NYC) and Section 4 (Anticipated Article V Defences, specifically point (e) Public-policy violation), noting that the French injunction is the only 'policy' argument the supplier can raise, implying that the enforcement court must consider this potential conflict, which relates to the public policy exception under Article V(2)(b) (though the table focuses on V(1)(e)). Crucially, the table's final point states: 'The only \\u201cpolicy\\u201d argument the supplier can raise is the French injunction, which is a proced[ural defect/conflict]...'. This directly addresses the scenario where the injunction (a foreign procedural order) might be argued as violating U.S. public policy if enforced, or conversely, how to defend against that argument.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f101b285-a1a0-4537-859b-11fe9252516e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2650, "completion_tokens": 266, "total_tokens": 2916}, "latency_s": 1.125235041952692, "request_id": "DeuUaeafDJz07M8PqPy4oQI", "raw_response": null}
