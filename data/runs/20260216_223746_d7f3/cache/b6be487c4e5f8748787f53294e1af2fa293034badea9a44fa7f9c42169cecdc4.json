{"provider": "mistral_api", "model": "mistral/magistral-medium-latest", "text": "In Swiss corporate law, the primary duty of a company's directors is to act in the best interests of the company, which is often interpreted as maximizing shareholder value. This aligns to some extent with Milton Friedman's statement that the sole social responsibility of business is to increase its profits. However, Swiss law also recognizes that companies have responsibilities to other stakeholders.\n\nAccording to Art. 717 Abs. 1 OR, the board of directors must manage the company with due care and diligence, considering the interests of shareholders, employees, and creditors. This provision indicates that while profit maximization is important, it is not the only responsibility of a business.\n\nFurthermore, companies have legal obligations that go beyond profit maximization. For example, they must comply with labor laws (Art. 319 ff. OR), environmental regulations (Umweltgesetzgebung), and tax laws (Steuergesetze). These obligations can be seen as social responsibilities that businesses must fulfill.\n\nIn the context of corporate social responsibility (CSR), which may have been covered in the course, it is widely recognized that businesses have responsibilities not only to their shareholders but also to other stakeholders such as employees, customers, suppliers, and the community. While Friedman's view emphasizes shareholder primacy, modern corporate governance often adopts a more balanced approach that considers the interests of all stakeholders.\n\nIn conclusion, while profit maximization is a fundamental responsibility of business, it is not the only one. Businesses also have legal and ethical responsibilities to other stakeholders. Therefore, I disagree with Friedman's statement that the sole social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the primary legal duty of directors under Swiss law is to the company and its shareholders. But this duty is not absolute and must be balanced with the interests of other stakeholders and compliance with legal obligations.\n\nIf the course covered specific topics or cases that are relevant to this discussion, please provide more details so that I can tailor my response accordingly.\n\nFor now, based on Swiss corporate law and general principles of corporate social responsibility, I disagree with Friedman's statement.\n\n---\n\nTo summarize, while profit maximization is a key goal, businesses have broader responsibilities under Swiss law and ethical considerations.\n\n(Note: If the course covered specific legal cases or doctrines that are relevant to this discussion, please provide more details so that the response can be more precisely tailored to the course material.)", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 141, "completion_tokens": 1185, "total_tokens": 1326}, "latency_s": 22.95601033300045, "request_id": "c5b77dce1aaf4294a3f7002080a823c8", "raw_response": null}
