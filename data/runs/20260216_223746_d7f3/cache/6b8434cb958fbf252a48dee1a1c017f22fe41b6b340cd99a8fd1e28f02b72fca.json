The candidate answer mentions Section 2(3) in the section titled 'Seat of arbitration considerations' but it does so only in the context of extending court powers (s.44) to foreign-seated arbitrations, not in the context of the general appropriateness of the court acting, which is primarily governed by Section 44(5) and the principle of supporting the tribunal. Crucially, the response does not discuss the specific effect or application of Section 2(3) itself regarding the court's discretion or appropriateness, which is what the criterion implies by linking it to the court's decision to act.\", \"criterion_id\": \"27a7166e-59ca-4a59-8eb6-7e17bb61462f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2263, "completion_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 2470}, "latency_s": 2.2851789580017794, "request_id": "RL2UaZKSJoqB7M8P4pHemAI", "raw_response": null}
