The candidate answer discusses that courts consider the 'Practical effectiveness of either forum' and that factors favoring court intervention include 'Urgency: If the tribunal can't act quickly enough to prevent asset dissipation.' However, it does not state the strict legal requirement that the court *shall* act *only if* the tribunal cannot act effectively. Instead, it presents this as one factor among several in a balancing exercise, suggesting the court *may* decline or stay proceedings if the tribunal is capable, but it never articulates the strict 'only if' condition required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"99bd5e85-c863-444f-96b7-f20fdf0e4b8d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1130, "completion_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 1325}, "latency_s": 0.8921470830100589, "request_id": "kNuUaaaXPIy0vdIP55ysuQ4", "raw_response": null}
