While the candidate provides the date of the legal text adoption (24 Mar 2023) rather than the specific UK Parliamentary approval date mentioned in the criterion (22 March 2023), it clearly identifies the WF as the negotiated replacement for the Protocol, confirms its adoption, and provides a relevant date of formalization (24 Mar 2023). Given the context of the surrounding information provided, this is a sufficient fulfillment of the core requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"dad0e919-f700-46a6-aa9a-2b1456a237f3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2720, "completion_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 2973}, "latency_s": 1.1605318750371225, "request_id": "3TOVaYD1NvKcnsEPtfCWuQg", "raw_response": null}
