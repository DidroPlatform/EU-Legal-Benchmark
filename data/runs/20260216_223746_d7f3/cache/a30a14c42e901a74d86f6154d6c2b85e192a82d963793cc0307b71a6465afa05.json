UK PE Risk for the LP\n\n**The Bad News: High PE Risk**\n\nThe Dutch CV (commanditaire vennootschap) is **tax transparent** under both Dutch and UK law. This creates immediate problems:\n\n- **UK tax treatment**: HMRC will look through the CV and attribute its activities directly to the LP partners\n- **PE trigger**: If the CV has substance (office, employees making decisions on licensing), those activities are **directly attributed** to the UK LP\n- **Fixed place PE**: CV's Dutch office = potential fixed place of business PE in Netherlands for the UK LP\n- **Agency PE**: If CV employees negotiate/conclude contracts, they're acting as dependent agents of the LP\n\n**Critical point**: You can't use a transparent entity to create distance from PE-creating activities. The transparency that makes the CV attractive for treaty access is exactly what creates PE exposure.\n\n## 2. Treaty Benefit Analysis\n\n**The Worse News: Likely Fails**\n\nYour structure has a fatal flaw in the **NL-Singapore treaty access**:\n\n- **Principal Purpose Test (PPT)**: Post-MLI, the NL-SG treaty includes PPT\n- **Obtaining treaty benefits for UK resident = principal purpose**: Obvious\n- **Conduit arrangement**: CV with no substance = treaty shopping red flag\n\n**Singapore's position**: Increasingly aggressive on beneficial ownership and PPT. They'll argue:\n- CV isn't beneficial owner (just conduit)\n- UK LP is the true beneficial owner\n- No UK-SG treaty = no reduced WHT rate\n\n## 3. What Actually Happens\n\n**Likely outcome without restructure:**\n\n1. **Netherlands**: CV is transparent → no Dutch tax (good)\n2. **Singapore**: Denies treaty benefit → **30% WHT** on royalties (bad)\n3. **UK**: LP taxed on full royalty income, credits for SG WHT (if any)\n4. **Netherlands**: Potential PE assessment for LP → Dutch tax on royalties + compliance burden (very bad)\n\n## 4. The Real Issues\n\n- **No UK-SG treaty**: This is your fundamental problem. Rate is 10% under domestic law, but no treaty protection\n- **CV adds cost, no benefit**: You're creating PE risk and substance requirements for zero WHT savings\n- **MLI impact**: Even if this worked pre-2020, PPT kills it now\n\n## 5. What You Should Actually Do\n\n**Option A: Direct licensing** (UK LP → Singapore)\n- 10% WHT under SG domestic law\n- No PE risk\n- No Dutch compliance costs\n- Clean and defensible\n\n**Option B: Genuine IP holding company**\n- Sell/transfer patents to Dutch BV (opaque entity)\n- Real substance: board decisions, IP management in NL\n- Might survive PPT if commercial rationale exists\n- Expensive and time-consuming\n\n**Option C: Singapore structure**\n- License to Singapore IP holding company\n- Sub-license to pubco\n- Keeps value in SG, potential tax incentives\n- Check if this triggers SG PE for LP\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n**Kill this structure.** You're spending money to:\n- Create PE risk in Netherlands\n- Trigger PPT denial in Singapore  \n- End up with 30% WHT instead of 10%\n- Add compliance in two extra jurisdictions\n\nThe CV routing makes sense in **zero** scenarios here. If deal team insists, get written tax opinions from Big 4 in all three jurisdictions and watch them hedge every conclusion to death.\n\nWhat's the commercial driver here?
