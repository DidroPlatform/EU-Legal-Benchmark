The insurance section is separate.\\n\\nCrucially, the response fails to explicitly cite the **Hague Service/Evidence Conventions** as foundational support for the evidence coordination section, which is a core component of cross-border coordination analysis.\\n\\nBecause the response lists many laws but does not clearly and comprehensively cite the specific set of laws required to support the *coordination analyses* as detailed in the criterion, it does not fully satisfy the requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"81a868b6-0097-462d-a1d0-691b3c9cfab5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4503, "completion_tokens": 539, "total_tokens": 5042}, "latency_s": 1.9414680000045337, "request_id": "GfiUaf3eIv7MkdUPkdfHmAk", "raw_response": null}
