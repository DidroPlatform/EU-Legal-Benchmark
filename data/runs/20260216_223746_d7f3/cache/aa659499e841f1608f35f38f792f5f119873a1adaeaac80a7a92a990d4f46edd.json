Statement ii is false: Even temporary/mobile structures (Glaszimmer) anchored to the ground constitute buildings or installations (Bauten/Anlagen) under Swiss law. Their placement outside building zones (in unberührter Natur) is generally prohibited (Art. 16 RPG) and certainly requires a building permit, which would likely be denied. Therefore, only statement ii is false.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1041, "completion_tokens": 6205, "total_tokens": 7246}, "latency_s": 168.60495058400556, "request_id": "chatcmpl-8b7f6915aeefb1a8", "raw_response": null}
