The candidate answer addresses the third-party assessor's liability under Section 3 (Professional Negligence) and notes that their report failed to address electrical safety/PAT testing, which is a weakness. Crucially, in Section 3.3, the candidate states: \\\"If they held themselves out as competent to carry out fire risk assessments and produced a report that failed to address a fundamental and foreseeable ignition source (electrical equipment), they may be liable for professional negligence in civil law.\\\" It then immediately follows up with: \\\"Their report should have identified electrical equipment as a potential ignition source and recommended appropriate controls, including PAT testing or equivalent electrical safety checks.\\\" This directly addresses the condition: if the report *had* mentioned the responsibility (i.e., recommended controls/PAT testing), the assessor's liability would be mitigated or eliminated, and the responsible person's (the owner's) liability would also be significantly reduced. The response correctly frames the assessor's potential liability based on the *omission* of this crucial detail, thereby satisfying the premise of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c3f440bd-74b7-4346-bb37-641760e3aa9f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4428, "completion_tokens": 304, "total_tokens": 4732}, "latency_s": 2.1871217080042697, "request_id": "B7-UaYDOMob1kdUP8IrTsQU", "raw_response": null}
