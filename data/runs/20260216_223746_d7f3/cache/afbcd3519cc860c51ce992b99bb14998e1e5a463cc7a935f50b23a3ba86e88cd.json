This is a classic **two-front war** where the optimal strategy on one front is catastrophic on the other. Let me work through this systematically.\n\n---\n\n## First: Why Neither Pure Option Works\n\n**Taking the deal as offered** hands plaintiffs' counsel exactly what they need. \"Should have known\" plus \"chose to ignore red flags to save money\" is essentially an admission against interest. In a wrongful death case involving contaminated or substandard medical supplies, that language is devastating. Juries will not parse the distinction between tax negligence and clinical negligence. The narrative writes itself.\n\n**Fighting HMRC to the wall** is equally dangerous. If you lose, you're looking at the unpaid duties, VAT, potentially substantial penalties, and possible criminal prosecution of individuals within the hospital's procurement chain. That financial exposure could genuinely destroy the institution, which means the civil plaintiffs get nothing anyway and patients lose their hospital.\n\nSo you're right to ask about a third way.\n\n---\n\n## The Third Way: Negotiate the Language, Compartmentalise the Admissions\n\nHere's where I'd focus the team's energy.\n\n### 1. The Deal Is Not Final Until It's Signed\n\nHMRC has made an opening offer. They want cooperation and they want evidence against the logistics network. That gives your client **significant leverage** because their case against the carousel operators is apparently weaker without your client's records and testimony.\n\nThe critical move is to **negotiate what your client actually admits to**. There is a vast difference between these formulations:\n\n- *\"Our client should have known and ignored red flags\"* — this is what they're asking for, and it's fatal in civil proceedings\n- *\"Our client relied on the logistics company's representations and customs documentation, and did not have the specialist customs expertise to identify the undervaluation scheme\"* — this still gives HMRC what they need (evidence the logistics company was systematically deceiving importers) while framing your client as a **victim of the fraud rather than a participant**\n\nHMRC doesn't actually need your client to be negligent to prosecute the carousel operators. They need your client to demonstrate **what the logistics company did, how they did it, and what they told their clients**. The logistics company's knowledge and intent is what matters for the criminal case, not your client's.\n\nPush back hard on the \"should have known\" language. A good tax silk should be able to negotiate a cooperation agreement that provides full documentary and testimonial cooperation without conceding constructive knowledge.\n\n### 2. Structure the Agreement to Limit Collateral Damage\n\nSpecifically negotiate for:\n\n**Confidentiality provisions** — the cooperation agreement itself should be subject to restrictions on disclosure. HMRC may resist this, but there are precedents for limiting the use of material provided under compulsion or cooperation agreements.\n\n**Use restrictions** — explicitly provide that admissions made in the context of the cooperation agreement cannot be used in civil proceedings. Now, I'll be honest: this is **difficult to enforce against third-party plaintiffs** who aren't party to the agreement. But it creates procedural hurdles and arguments for exclusion.\n\n**Careful framing of the statement of facts** — every word matters. The agreed factual basis should describe what happened without characterising your client's state of mind in ways that map onto civil negligence.\n\n### 3. Separate the Tax Exposure from the Civil Narrative\n\nEven if you reach a cooperation agreement, you need to **proactively control the narrative** in the civil cases. The story should be:\n\n*\"The hospital was the victim of a sophisticated criminal fraud perpetrated by a logistics company that deceived dozens of organisations. When the hospital discovered the fraud, it cooperated fully with law enforcement to bring the criminals to justice. The hospital's procurement decisions were based on fraudulent representations, not on any disregard for quality or safety.\"*\n\nThis reframes cooperation with HMRC as **evidence of good faith**, not an admission of wrongdoing.\n\n### 4. The Critical Factual Question You Need Answered Now\n\nBefore you make any decision, your forensic team needs to nail down one thing: **is there actually a causal link between the undervaluation fraud and the patient harm?**\n\nUndervaluing goods for customs purposes doesn't necessarily mean the goods themselves were substandard. The logistics company may have been declaring lower values on legitimate products to reduce duty payments. If the products that reached patients were the same products that were ordered and met specifications, then the tax fraud and the patient deaths may be **entirely separate chains of causation**.\n\nIf that's the case, the tax cooperation agreement becomes much less dangerous in the civil context, because even if plaintiffs get hold of it, the response is: *\"Yes, the logistics company committed customs fraud. No, that has nothing to do with the quality of supplies that reached patients. Those are different questions entirely.\"*\n\nIf, on the other hand, the undervaluation was achieved by **substituting cheaper, inferior products**, then the link is direct and you have a much harder problem, but also a much stronger argument that your client was deceived rather than complicit.\n\n---\n\n## The Weighing Framework\n\nIf I'm forced to choose between the two pure options, I lean toward **taking a negotiated version of the deal**, for these reasons:\n\n- **Institutional survival is the threshold question.** A hospital that ceases to exist cannot serve patients, cannot compensate victims, cannot do anything. Financial collapse is the worst outcome for everyone, including the plaintiffs.\n- **Civil cases can be managed, settled, insured against, and structured.** Criminal tax exposure and HMRC penalties cannot be negotiated in the same way after a loss.\n- **Cooperation reframed as victimhood is a viable narrative.** Fighting HMRC looks like concealment, which is worse in front of a jury than cooperation.\n- **The civil cases may be strong against you regardless.** If the underlying facts are bad, plaintiffs will build their negligence case with or without the tax agreement. You may be overestimating how much incremental damage the agreement causes.\n\n---\n\n## Immediate Next Steps\n\n1. **Do not respond to HMRC's informal approach yet.** Ask for time. They want this deal too, so they'll give you reasonable time to consider.\n2. **Get your tax silk and your civil litigation lead in the same room** to war-game the exact language that HMRC would need versus what the civil plaintiffs could exploit.\n3. **Nail down the causation question** — is the undervaluation connected to product quality or not?\n4. **Explore whether your professional indemnity or institutional insurance policies** have any coverage that interacts with either the tax settlement or the civil claims.\n5. **Consider whether the logistics company and its insurers** are the proper deep pocket here — if they perpetrated the fraud, your client's civil defence may substantially involve redirecting liability toward them.\n\nThe third way exists. But it requires treating the HMRC offer as the **start** of a negotiation, not a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Your leverage is their need for your client's evidence.
