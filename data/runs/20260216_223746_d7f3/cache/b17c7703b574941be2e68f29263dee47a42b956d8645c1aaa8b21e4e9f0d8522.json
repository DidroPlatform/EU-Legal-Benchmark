The candidate answer states, \\\"You need a qualified supervisor (someone 21+ with a full license) sitting beside you\\\" and \\\"If you're driving alone without these, you *could* face penalties.\\\" While this strongly implies the illegality of unsupervised driving with a provisional license, it does not explicitly state that driving alone with *only* the learner's license (provisional license) is illegal, focusing instead on the requirement for a supervisor. The context is driving home after failing the practical test, meaning the user is currently driving on their provisional license. The response implies the illegality but does not state the core fact required by the criterion clearly enough.\", \"criterion_id\": \"eb545792-32ff-4d27-b44a-8f37a958dd90\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 587, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 797}, "latency_s": 1.509806792018935, "request_id": "hdeUab-nDq3hnsEP0oDs0QE", "raw_response": null}
