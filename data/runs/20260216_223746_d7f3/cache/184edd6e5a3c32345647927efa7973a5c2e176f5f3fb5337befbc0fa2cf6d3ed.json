Let me break down where you actually stand, because registration (or lack of it) isn't the barrier you might think in the UK.\n\n## The Good News First\n\n**Copyright exists automatically in the UK.** You own copyright in your 40 pages the moment you created them—no registration needed. This is a common misconception. Your work is protected whether you registered it or not.\n\n## What You Likely Have Claims For\n\n**1. The scraping itself (training data)**\nThis is murkier but not hopeless:\n- UK copyright law *doesn't* have a blanket \"text and data mining\" exception for commercial AI training (unlike the EU)\n- However, there's a narrow exception for non-commercial research\n- If Synthetic Dreams Corp scraped for *commercial* model training without permission, they may have infringed your reproduction right\n- The fact you posted it publicly doesn't waive your copyright—it's still yours\n\n**2. The fizzy drink ad (the bigger issue)**\nThis is much clearer:\n- The generated image of \"Ophelia\" is likely a derivative work of your character\n- If it's recognisably derived from your original character design, that's infringement of your right to create derivative works\n- The fact it's \"slightly altered\" doesn't matter—derivative works still need permission\n- The user's credit doesn't help them; they needed *your* permission, not just the AI company's\n\n## The Complications\n\n**Character protection is trickier than plot/artwork:**\n- Copyright protects the *specific artistic expression* of Ophelia (how you drew her)\n- It's weaker on the character concept itself (though not unprotectable)\n- You'd need to show the ad version is substantially similar to your specific artistic choices\n\n**The causal chain matters:**\n- You need to prove: your work → training data → model output → ad image\n- This requires evidence of what Synthetic Dreams Corp actually used\n- Their terms of service and documentation will be crucial\n\n## What You Should Do Now\n\n**Immediate steps:**\n\n1. **Document everything:**\n   - Screenshot/archive your original online posts (dates, URLs)\n   - Screenshot the ad, any credits, where it ran\n   - Any communication with Synthetic Dreams Corp\n   - The model's outputs if you can access them\n\n2. **Get legal advice from a UK IP specialist** (this is important—don't DIY this)\n   - Look for solicitors specialising in copyright/digital IP\n   - Many offer initial consultations\n   - Some work on contingency for strong cases\n\n3. **Send a cease-and-desist letter** (via your solicitor)\n   - Formal notice often prompts settlement discussions\n   - Creates a paper trail\n   - Shows you're serious\n\n4. **Consider the Intellectual Property Office (IPO)**\n   - They have guidance on AI and copyright\n   - Not a court, but useful for understanding your position\n\n## The Realistic Picture\n\n**Strengths of your case:**\n- Clear original authorship (you created it)\n- Commercial infringement (the ad)\n- Identifiable derivative work\n- UK copyright is automatic\n\n**Challenges:**\n- AI liability is genuinely unsettled law—courts haven't fully ruled on scraping yet\n- The user (not the company) made the ad, which complicates liability\n- You'd likely need to prove the model was trained on *your specific work*\n- US company = potential jurisdictional complexity (though the ad ran nationally, so UK courts might have jurisdiction)\n\n## One More Thing\n\n**You didn't \"screw yourself\" by not registering.** Seriously. UK copyright doesn't require registration. What *would* have helped:\n- Watermarking your work\n- Explicit terms of use on your site (\"not for AI training\")\n- Registering with the UK Copyright Service (optional but creates evidence)\n\nBut none of that was necessary for you to own the copyright.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** You have a real claim, particularly on the ad. The scraping is legally murkier but not indefensible. This is worth pursuing with proper legal advice. Don't let the lack of registration make you think you're powerless—you're not.\n\nWould it help to know what to look for in an IP solicitor, or do you have questions about any of this?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 282, "completion_tokens": 982, "total_tokens": 1264}, "latency_s": 12.724897958018119, "request_id": "chatcmpl-d8067c85-31c1-4dca-808c-5e47a4bc4378", "raw_response": null}
