The **compromesso** (preliminary contract) is legally binding, typically with a 10-30% deposit (caparra), and commits both parties to finalize the deed (rogito) later. Breaching it can mean losing your deposit or facing lawsuits. Always consult a **notary (notaio)**—they're impartial public officials required for the final deed—and consider hiring an independent **lawyer (avvocato)** or **geometra** (surveyor) fluent in English, especially as a foreigner. Here's what to watch for:\n\n#### 1. **Hidden Costs (Expect 8-15% of Purchase Price on Top of Asking Price)**\n   - **Taxes**:\n     | Buyer Type | Registration Tax | Fixed Assets Tax (Cadastral) | Mortgage Tax | Total ~ |\n     |------------|------------------|------------------------------|--------------|---------|\n     | First home (prima casa) | 2% | €50-200 | €50 | 2-3% |\n     | Investment/second home | 9% | €500+ | €200+ | 9-12% |\n     | New build (IVA) | 4-10% VAT | Varies | Varies | 10-22% |\n     - Prima casa discount requires residency intent within 18 months.\n   - **Notary Fees**: €1,500-4,000 (based on price/location).\n   - **Real Estate Agent Fees**: 2-3% + VAT (often split, but confirm who's paying).\n   - **Land Registry & Checks**: €300-1,000 for title searches (visura catastale, ipotecaria).\n   - **Other**: Energy certificate (APE, €150-300), utilities transfer (€200+), insurance, possible condo fees (if apartment).\n   - **Currency/Transfer**: Bank fees for international wires (use Wise/SEPA); budget for exchange rate fluctuations.\n   - **Renovations**: Old properties often need seismic/upgrades—get quotes pre-signing.\n\n   **Tip**: Negotiate seller covers some costs (e.g., agency fees) in the compromesso.\n\n#### 2. **Legal Risks & Due Diligence (Do This BEFORE Signing)**\n   - **Ownership & Encumbrances**:\n     - Verify seller owns 100% (no co-owners, heirs issues). Get **visure** (registry extracts) for last 30+ years.\n     - Check for mortgages, liens, seizures (pignoramenti), or easements via **Agenzia delle Entrate** or notary.\n   - **Building Compliance**:\n     - **Urbanistic conformity** (conformità urbanistica): Ensure permits match reality—no illegal extensions (abusivismo).\n     - **Geometra certification**: Mandatory; uncovers zoning violations (fines up to €100k+).\n     - **Seismic/agricultural rules**: Strict in quake zones or farmland (no building without permits).\n   - **Energy & Habitability**:\n     - Valid **APE** (energy label)—seller must provide.\n     - **Certificato di agibilità** (habitability)—old buildings may lack it.\n   - **Seller Risks**:\n     - Bankruptcy, divorce, or inheritance disputes.\n     - Undeclared income/taxes owed (can attach to property).\n   - **Foreigner-Specific**:\n     - EU citizens: Easy. Non-EU: No restrictions on buying, but check visa/residency (e.g., Elective Residence Visa).\n     - Golden Visa if investing €250k+ in certain areas.\n\n   **Red Flags**: Vague docs, pressure to sign fast, rural \"bargains\" with permit issues.\n\n#### 3. **Steps to Protect Yourself Pre-Compromesso**\n   1. **Offer (Proposta d'Acquisto)**: Non-binding, low deposit (€1k-5k), conditional on checks.\n   2. **Hire Pros**:\n      - Notary for preliminary search (€500-1k).\n      - Lawyer/geometra for full due diligence (2-4 weeks, €2k-5k).\n      - Independent surveyor for structural inspection.\n   3. **Compromesso Clauses**:\n      - **Penali** (penalties) for delays/breaches.\n      - Suspensive conditions (e.g., financing approval, clear title).\n      - Caparra confirmatoria (10% standard; penitenziale allows walk-away by forfeiting double).\n      - Final price adjustments (e.g., for inventory).\n   4. **Timeline**: 1-3 months to rogito; pay balance then.\n   5. **Financing**: Italian banks wary of foreigners—pre-approve; expect 50-70% LTV.\n\n#### Final Tips\n- **Budget Total**: Asking price + 10-15%. Use sites like Idealista/Immobiliare for comps.\n- **Regions Vary**: Tuscany/Lake Como pricier/taxier; South cheaper but riskier (Mafia-linked sales rare but check).\n- **Post-Purchase**: IMU property tax (0.4-1.1%), TARI waste tax.\n- **Resources**: Notaio.it, AgenziaEntrate.gov.it, or expat forums (e.g., Expats in Italy FB group).\n\n**Disclaimer**: This is general info based on Italian law (as of 2023). Laws change; get personalized advice from a licensed Italian notary/lawyer. Avoid DIY—mistakes cost thousands.
