The candidate answer addresses constructive notice under Section 2.A, stating: 'If you were living in the property at the time of the remortgage, or if there was any evidence (e.g., emails, texts, utility bills in your name) that the bank *should* have known about your beneficial interest, a court *might* rule that the bank had **constructive notice** of your beneficial interest.' While it doesn't explicitly list 'furniture' or 'personal belongings' as examples of occupation, it directly addresses the concept of being 'living in the property' as the primary indicator of constructive notice that a lender should investigate, which aligns with the intent of the criterion regarding physical presence/signs of habitation apparent to a lender.\", \"criterion_id\": \"52652878-e3f0-4e46-ac6b-dde189cd58b5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2709, "completion_tokens": 262, "total_tokens": 2971}, "latency_s": 0.8904893329599872, "request_id": "hfmUaerTFNihnsEPoYDhmQo", "raw_response": null}
