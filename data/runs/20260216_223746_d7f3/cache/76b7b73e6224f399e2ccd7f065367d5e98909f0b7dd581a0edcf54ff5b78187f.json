It explicitly states the tax/compliance implications for both scenarios and offers a practical decision framework, which satisfies the requirement to provide a preferable option based on the *given information* (or lack thereof, by explaining the dependency).\", \"criterion_id\": \"887fd3f3-7bf5-4734-9865-55a4d162238f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2364, "completion_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 2538}, "latency_s": 0.7433831249945797, "request_id": "BBiVaZbWHdrbxs0P1qTOyAQ", "raw_response": null}
