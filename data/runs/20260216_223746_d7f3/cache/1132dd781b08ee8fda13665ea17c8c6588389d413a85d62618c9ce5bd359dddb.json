The candidate answer focuses heavily on operational splits, using fiscal representatives, and amending Incoterms/POs. While it suggests amending the PO to force the buyer's hand (Option 3 in Section 1C), this is framed as leveraging contract terms rather than a 'negotiated settlement' in the sense of finding a mutually agreeable compromise on the customs/origin issue itself, distinct from the formal options presented (splitting entries, seeking BOI). The response does not explicitly mention or detail a 'negotiated settlement' as a distinct strategy for resolving the origin dispute or IOR liability outside of the established legal/operational pathways.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3d32006b-4c2e-4e17-ba68-4187c3803e7e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2968, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 3191}, "latency_s": 1.3105590000050142, "request_id": "NfmUafX2K67pnsEP2M6v6QU", "raw_response": null}
