{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 0, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires the response to state that if the international license is from an EEA country or a designated country like America, the driver could drive temporarily without the L plates. The candidate answer discusses the validity of foreign licenses based on residency status (visitor vs. resident, 12-month rule) and whether the country is designated, but it does not explicitly mention the scenario where a driver with a full foreign license (from an EEA or designated country) can drive temporarily *without* L plates after failing the UK test. The answer implies that if the foreign license is valid for solo driving (as a visitor or within the 12-month grace period), L plates are not required, but it fails to directly address the specific condition mentioned in the criterion (EEA/designated country license holder driving temporarily without L plates in the context of having just failed the UK test). The closest relevant section states that if the driver is a visitor with a full, valid license from an EU/EEA country or designated non-EU country, they 'may drive as you would at home,' which implies no L plates, but it doesn't explicitly link this to the situation of having just failed the UK test, which is the context of the user's query.\", \"criterion_id\": \"28d61f08-2c76-49c0-9c19-79d58a2db576\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2816, "completion_tokens": 307, "total_tokens": 3123}, "latency_s": 1.4969983749906532, "request_id": "zeaUaYy9IciFxN8PnZ-48Qs", "raw_response": null}
