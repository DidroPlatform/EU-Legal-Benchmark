The candidate answer discusses the substantive defense strategy, including the need to prove the security vulnerabilities were not a material breach under Delaware law and that the termination was pretextual. It mentions limiting reputation damages and seeking expectation damages for the client, but it does not explicitly state or analyze the *German distributor's* burden of proof for proving damages (especially reputation damages) as being 'high' or likely to fail based on legal thresholds. It only suggests a tactical goal to 'Dismiss or minimize' reputation damages.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d00808cb-d679-4896-825b-ae9319778964\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2068, "completion_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 2252}, "latency_s": 0.732994707999751, "request_id": "IDKVadeUH-OkkdUPvpSE8Qg", "raw_response": null}
