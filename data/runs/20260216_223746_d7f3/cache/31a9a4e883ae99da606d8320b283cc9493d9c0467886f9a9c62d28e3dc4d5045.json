Under Section I.A, it identifies that the London seat means the English Arbitration Act 1996 governs the process and that English courts serve as the curial courts with supervisory authority. Crucially, under Section I.B, it discusses the German firm's threat to sue in German courts and details the strategy to counter this, including applying to the English High Court for an anti-suit injunction to restrain those proceedings, citing the post-Brexit regaining of power to do so.
