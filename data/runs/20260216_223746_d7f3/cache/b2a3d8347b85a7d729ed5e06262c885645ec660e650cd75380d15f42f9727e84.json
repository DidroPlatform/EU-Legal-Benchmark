The candidate answer discusses the NL-SG treaty benefit extensively, focusing on beneficial ownership, transparency mismatches, and anti-avoidance rules (including principal purpose reasoning). However, it never explicitly states the condition required by the criterion: that the benefit is obtainable *if* the CV passes the principal purpose test. It implies that passing anti-abuse tests is necessary, but does not frame the possibility of obtaining the benefit contingent on passing the PPT specifically.\", \"criterion_id\": \"012f8564-ac72-4ce7-8e0e-0ebe7161dd9a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1773, "completion_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 1947}, "latency_s": 0.6737849169876426, "request_id": "wRSVaePwG9qb28oPgemZoQg", "raw_response": null}
