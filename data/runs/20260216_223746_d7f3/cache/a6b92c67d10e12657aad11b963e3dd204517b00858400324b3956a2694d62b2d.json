The candidate answer correctly identifies the need for competition filings in Chile and explicitly mentions the relevant Chilean antitrust authority, stating: 'Competition and Data Protection Filings (Chile): Notification to the Fiscalía Nacional Económica (FNE) is required if the transaction meets the thresholds set forth in Decreto Ley 211 (Chile) regarding market share or transaction value.' Although the candidate answer incorrectly cites the law as 'Decreto Ley 211' in the competition section (the correct law is Ley 19.994, which established the FNE, and subsequent amendments to DL 211 or specific merger control regulations), it correctly identifies the *requirement* for notification to the *FNE* based on a Chilean competition law instrument, which satisfies the core intent of the criterion (identifying the Chilean competition filing requirement and citing the relevant legal instrument, even if the specific decree number cited in the prompt is slightly off or refers to an older/related provision). The candidate explicitly links the FNE notification to 'Decreto Ley 211 (Chile)'.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9b7ae9ee-f2cc-4e51-850b-dc8702070b7d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4312, "completion_tokens": 308, "total_tokens": 4620}, "latency_s": 1.7824639169848524, "request_id": "jMOUafmlDumekdUPq_LrcQ", "raw_response": null}
