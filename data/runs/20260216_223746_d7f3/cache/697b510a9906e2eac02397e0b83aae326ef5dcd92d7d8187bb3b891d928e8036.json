The candidate answer discusses general principles across multiple jurisdictions, focusing heavily on the priority of a *registered* charge over a *later* equitable claim (Section 1) and various ways to *challenge* the priority (Section 2). It does not explicitly state the rule described in the criterion: that a registered charge against a sole proprietor *cannot* overreach an existing, unregistered beneficiary's interest. In fact, Section 1 suggests the opposite is usually true (registered charge wins over later equitable claim).\", \"criterion_id\": \"56903d4e-63dc-4bc3-85b3-6931cd0ed7b8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4186, "completion_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 4371}, "latency_s": 18.22209004202159, "request_id": "A-qUae7_Dr3ukdUPh-SHsAM", "raw_response": null}
