The candidate answer explicitly discusses the concept of novus actus interveniens (Section 3) and analyzes whether the drunk driver's swerve breaks the chain for the truck driver. It concludes that while the prosecution would argue the chain remains intact because reactions to debris are foreseeable, the defence has a realistic argument that the drunk driver's extreme fault (intoxication and swerving into another car) is sufficiently independent and culpable to be regarded as the main cause, potentially preventing attribution of the ultimate injury to the truck driver for result-crimes that require causation of serious injury/death. This directly addresses the core concept required by the criterion: analyzing whether an intervening act breaks the chain of causation relative to the prior act.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a9079b34-fa4a-4ba6-ab1d-a638762f1067\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1788, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 2022}, "latency_s": 0.7649094589869492, "request_id": "bR6Vae-nKoqjkdUP8qvu2QQ", "raw_response": null}
