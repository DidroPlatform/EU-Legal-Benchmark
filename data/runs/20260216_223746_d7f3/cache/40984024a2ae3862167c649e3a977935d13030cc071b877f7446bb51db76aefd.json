The model lists 'Harassment or illegal eviction (Protection from Eviction Act 1977)' and 'Failure to protect your deposit in a government-approved scheme (Housing Act 2004, ss.213-215)' as potential counterclaims. While failure to protect a deposit primarily results in civil penalties (1-3 times the deposit), illegal eviction/harassment under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 is explicitly a criminal offence, satisfying the requirement for at least one clear criminal offence. Furthermore, the model explicitly states that harassment/illegal eviction 'is a criminal offence as well as a civil wrong,' thus meeting the spirit of the requirement by identifying a relevant statutory offence that carries criminal penalties.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ea1a9a8b-7d7c-44c1-8ced-c217d5f70a0c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1487, "completion_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 1712}, "latency_s": 1.0713188750087284, "request_id": "v8GUaZv9Ia3hnsEP0oDs0QE", "raw_response": null}
