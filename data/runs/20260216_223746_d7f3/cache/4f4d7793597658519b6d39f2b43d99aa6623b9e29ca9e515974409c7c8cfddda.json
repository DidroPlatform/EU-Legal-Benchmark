The candidate answer details Control Point 2.1: Transfer Pricing Documentation. Under the 'Reporting Cadence' section for this control, it lists: '- Quarterly: TP compliance dashboard to CFO'. While it mentions a quarterly report, it is directed to the CFO, not explicitly confirmed as the minimum reporting cadence *to the Audit Committee* as required by the criterion. Furthermore, the criterion refers to a 'Transfer Pricing Compliance control', which is a reasonable proxy for Control Point 2.1, but the reporting cadence specified for the Audit Committee for this control is 'Annual: Comprehensive TP documentation review to Audit Committee'. Since the criterion specifically asks for confirmation of a *minimum quarterly review* cadence *for the Audit Committee*, and the AC review is listed as Annual, this criterion is not strictly met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"63c199bd-96ce-47c1-b5dd-751d1b859f3c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4102, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 4336}, "latency_s": 1.1685552499839105, "request_id": "AOKUac2kIOCO28oPzLWAmAE", "raw_response": null}
