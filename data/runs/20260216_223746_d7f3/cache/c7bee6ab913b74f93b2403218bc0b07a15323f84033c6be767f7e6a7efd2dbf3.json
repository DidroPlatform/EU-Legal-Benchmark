The candidate answer explicitly addresses this balancing act in Section 3 (The balancing test) and Section 6 (Likely outcomes). Specifically, in the balancing test checklist (Step 2), it asks: 'Has the claimant asked the SIAC tribunal for a preservation order? If not, why not (e.g., tribunal not yet constituted, procedural delay, lack of jurisdiction over the assets)?' and concludes: 'If the tribunal can provide an equivalent measure, the court will stay the injunction pending the tribunal\\u2019s decision.' Furthermore, the summary states: 'If the assets are at real risk and the tribunal cannot act quickly, the court will usually let the injunction stand...' This directly reflects the condition that the court intervenes when the tribunal cannot act effectively or quickly enough.\", \"criterion_id\": \"99bd5e85-c863-444f-96b7-f20fdf0e4b8d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3893, "completion_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 4135}, "latency_s": 1.3363529579946771, "request_id": "qeqUaYuVErHzjrEPuLrQyQI", "raw_response": null}
