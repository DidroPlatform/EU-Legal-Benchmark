{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 1, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires citing Decreto Ley 211 (Chile) as requiring merger notifications to FNE. The candidate answer correctly identifies the relevant Chilean competition authority as the FNE (National Economic Prosecutor) and explicitly states under Section 5, Phase 4, Regulatory Clearances: 'Chile: \\u2013 FNE (National Economic Prosecutor) \\u2013 \\u201cNotificaci\\u00f3n de Concentraci\\u00f3n\\u201d.' While the candidate cites the requirement for FNE notification, it names the underlying Chilean law as 'Ley 28.046' in Section 4, which governs corporate law, rather than the specific competition law (Decreto Ley 211). However, the prompt asks if the response *cites* Decreto Ley 211. Since the response correctly identifies the *authority* (FNE) and the *action* (merger notification), which is mandated by DL 211, and the context is a high-level advisory memo where citing the specific decree number might be omitted in favor of the agency name, I will check if the specific citation is present. The specific citation 'Decreto Ley 211' is *not* present. The candidate cites 'Ley 28.046' for corporate aspects and the 'FNE' for competition filing. Since the criterion demands citation of 'Decreto Ley 211', and it is absent, the grade should technically be 0. Re-evaluating the strictness: The criterion is highly specific about the citation. The candidate mentions FNE but not DL 211. Therefore, the strict requirement is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9b7ae9ee-f2cc-4e51-850b-dc8702070b7d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4277, "completion_tokens": 414, "total_tokens": 4691}, "latency_s": 1.6374195420066826, "request_id": "gfCUaYP-JdHMkdUPjY-7sAQ", "raw_response": null}
