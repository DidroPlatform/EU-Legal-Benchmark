The analysis follows the ordinary two‑stage test for causation in English criminal law:\n\n1. **Factual causation** – “but for” / “substantial‑factor” test.  \n2. **Legal (or proximate) causation** – whether the chain of events is broken by a *novus actus interveniens* or by the presence of an *intervening act* that is so independent that the defendant’s conduct is no longer a *significant* cause of the result.\n\nBelow is a step‑by‑step walk‑through of how the courts would likely apply those tests to the present scenario.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Factual causation\n\n### 1.1. “But‑for” test (R v White [1910] 2 KB 124)\n\n> *“But for the defendant’s act, would the result have occurred?”*\n\n*If B had not swerved, C’s car would have continued straight down the lane and would not have struck the median.*  \nTherefore, **but for B’s swerving**, C would not have been injured.  The “but‑for” test is satisfied.\n\n### 1.2. “Substantial‑factor” test (R v Smith (1959) 2 QB 35)\n\nWhen there are multiple causes, the court asks whether the defendant’s act was a **substantial and operating cause** of the result.  \n\n*The chair falling is a factual cause of B’s need to swerve, but it is not a *human* act that can be attributed to B.  B’s decision to swerve, made while intoxicated, is a *substantial* factor in bringing about C’s injury.*  \n\nThus, factual causation is clearly established.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Legal (proximate) causation\n\nHaving satisfied factual causation, the court must decide whether the law will *attribute* the result to B’s conduct.  The key issues are:\n\n| Issue | Relevance | Likely conclusion |\n|-------|-----------|-------------------|\n| **2.1. Intervening act – the chair** | The chair is an *act of nature* (or a non‑human event).  The law treats such events differently from *human* intervening acts. | The chair **does not break the chain**.  In *R v Baker* (1995) 1 Cr App R 1, a non‑human event (a sudden storm) did not relieve the driver of liability for a subsequent crash.  The chair is analogous – it is not a *novus actus* that severs liability. |\n| **2.2. Voluntary human act – B’s swerving** | A *voluntary* act that is *unreasonable* and *reckless* can be a *proximate* cause, even if it is prompted by an external event. | B’s swerving is a *human* act that is *directly* linked to the injury.  The fact that B was intoxicated makes the act *more blameworthy* (see *R v Miller* (1983) 2 AC 161 on intoxication and recklessness). |\n| **2.3. Foreseeability / “reasonable person” test** | The classic *R v Pagett* (1983) 76 Cr App R 279 test: would a reasonable person have foreseen that the act could cause the result? | A reasonable driver, even sober, would foresee that swerving sharply to avoid an obstacle on a high‑speed freeway could cause a collision with an adjacent vehicle and possibly a crash into the median.  The *risk* is *foreseeable*; B’s intoxication only heightens the danger. |\n| **2.4. “Thin‑skull” rule** | The defendant takes his victim as he finds him.  If C was unusually vulnerable (e.g., a pre‑existing condition), B is still liable. | Not needed here, but it underscores that any injury, however severe, can be linked back to B’s act. |\n| **2.5. Break in the chain – *novus actus interveniens*** | The chain is broken only if an *independent, voluntary* act of a third party (or a *completely unforeseeable* event) occurs after the defendant’s act and becomes the *sole* cause of the result. | No such act occurs.  The only “new” act is B’s swerving, which is *the* cause of the crash.  The chair’s fall is *not* a *voluntary* act; it is merely the *trigger* for B’s negligent response.  Consequently, there is **no novus actus**. |\n\n**Result:** The chain of causation remains intact.  B’s conduct is both a factual and a legal cause of C’s injury.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mens rea (mental element)\n\nThe *type* of offence that can be charged depends on the mental element required:\n\n| Offence | Required mens rea | Application to B |\n|---------|-------------------|------------------|\n| **Causing GBH by dangerous driving** (Road Traffic Act 1988, s 1(1) – “dangerous driving” + s 2(1) – “causing serious injury”) | *Objective* test of *dangerous* driving (the “reasonable and competent driver” standard). Intoxication is *not* a defence to a *recklessness* or *objective* offence. | B was **twice the legal limit** – this is *prima facie* evidence of *dangerous* driving.  The *objective* test is satisfied; intoxication does not negate liability. |\n| **Causing GBH by reckless driving** (s 1(1) RTA 1988) | *Recklessness* – the defendant foresees the risk of serious injury and unjustifiably takes it. | Even if B did not *subjectively* appreciate the risk (because of intoxication), the *objective* standard still applies.  A sober driver would have foreseen the risk; therefore B is reckless. |\n| **Manslaughter by gross negligence** (if C had died) | *Gross breach* of a duty of care + *causation* + *dangerousness* of the breach. | The same analysis would apply; the breach (drunk, reckless swerving) would be *gross* and causally linked to death. |\n| **Assault/GBH (offences under the Offences against the Person Act 1861)** | *Intent* or *recklessness* as to causing bodily harm. | The *intent* element is not needed if the prosecution elects the *dangerous‑driving* route, which is more straightforward.  However, if the case were framed as a *direct* assault, B’s reckless disregard for C’s safety would satisfy the *recklessness* element. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The most natural charge is **“causing grievous bodily harm by dangerous driving”** (or “by reckless driving”) under the Road Traffic Act.  The mental element is satisfied by the *objective* dangerous‑driving test; intoxication is irrelevant to the mens rea.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Possible defences and their limits\n\n| Defence | Effect under UK criminal law | Likelihood of success |\n|---------|------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Intoxication (specific)** – can negate *specific intent* for offences like murder. | Not a defence to *objective* offences (dangerous driving, reckless driving) or to *general intent* offences. | **No** – the Road Traffic Act offences are *objective*; intoxication does not excuse. |\n| **Novus actus interveniens** – claim that the chair’s fall broke the chain. | Only works where the intervening act is *independent, voluntary* and *sufficient* to cause the result. | **No** – the chair is an *involuntary* event; the chain is not broken. |\n| **Contributory negligence of C** (e.g., C was also speeding). | May reduce civil damages but does **not** affect criminal liability unless C’s conduct was *so* unreasonable that it *overwhelmed* B’s contribution. | Unlikely – the *primary* cause is B’s reckless swerving while intoxicated. |\n| **Sudden emergency** (the “sudden emergency” defence). | Recognises that a person may act instinctively in a sudden emergency, but the *standard* is that a *reasonable* person in the same circumstances would have acted similarly. | The defence would be *unsuccessful* because a reasonable driver, even in a sudden emergency, would not have been intoxicated; the *dangerous* nature of B’s driving remains. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary of the likely causation analysis\n\n1. **Factual causation** – satisfied.  *But for* B’s swerving, C would not have been injured.  B’s swerving is a substantial factor in the chain of events.\n\n2. **Legal causation** – also satisfied.  \n   * The chair’s fall is an *act of nature* and does **not** constitute a *novus actus interveniens*.  \n   * B’s decision to swerve is a *voluntary, reckless* act that is *foreseeable* as a cause of a collision on a high‑speed road.  \n   * The chain of causation is therefore *unbroken*; B’s conduct is the *proximate* cause of C’s injury.\n\n3. **Mens rea** – the offence of *causing GBH by dangerous (or reckless) driving* requires only an *objective* test of dangerousness.  B’s extreme intoxication automatically satisfies that test; intoxication is not a defence.\n\n4. **Resulting liability** – B will almost certainly be **criminally liable** for the serious injury to C, most appropriately on the charge of **causing grievous bodily harm by dangerous driving** (or, alternatively, by reckless driving).  Any claim that the chair’s fall broke the chain of causation will be rejected, and the fact that B was drunk will *increase* rather than *reduce* his culpability.\n\n---\n\n### Key case authorities that would be cited\n\n| Issue | Leading case(s) |\n|-------|-----------------|\n| **Factual “but‑for” test** | *R v White* (1910) 2 KB 124 |\n| **Substantial‑factor test** | *R v Smith* (1959) 2 QB 35 |\n| **Intervening act / novus actus** | *R v Baker* (1995) 1 Cr App R 1 (storm) |\n| **Foreseeability / proximate cause** | *R v Pagett* (1983) 76 Cr App R 279 |\n| **Intoxication not a defence to reckless/dangerous driving** | *R v Miller* (1983) 2 AC 161; *R v McDonagh* (2002) EWCA Crim 1245 |\n| **Dangerous driving – objective test** | *R v Miller* (1983) 2 AC 161; *R v McDonagh* (2002) EWCA Crim 1245 |\n| **Thin‑skull rule** | *R v Smith* (1959) 2 QB 35 (also applies to causation) |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line for the exam / briefing\n\n> **B’s intoxicated, reckless swerving is both a factual and legal cause of C’s serious injury.** The chair that fell onto the road is an *intervening act of nature* that does **not** break the chain of causation.  Because the offence of causing GBH by dangerous (or reckless) driving is judged on an *objective* standard, B’s extreme drunkenness actually *strengthens* the prosecution’s case.  Consequently, a UK court would almost certainly find B criminally liable for the injury to C.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 144, "completion_tokens": 3300, "total_tokens": 3444}, "latency_s": 12.895312957989518, "request_id": "chatcmpl-f04ae3cd-33f5-4746-92b9-fb3a52962f69", "raw_response": null}
