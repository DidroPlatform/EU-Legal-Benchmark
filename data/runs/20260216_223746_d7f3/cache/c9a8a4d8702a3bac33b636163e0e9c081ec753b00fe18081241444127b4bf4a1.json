The response discusses the FTC limitation in the context of GILTI, noting that 'Foreign taxes paid by the European operating subsidiaries will generally fall into the GILTI basket... The challenge is that excess foreign tax credits in the GILTI basket cannot offset U.S. tax on other categories of income,' and later mentions that 'The foreign tax credit limitation for GILTI is calculated on a pooled basis across all CFCs, so high-taxed income from European operating subsidiaries might blend with low-taxed income from Ireland or Luxembourg.' While this describes the *effect* of the separate basket limitation (i.e., income segregation), it does not explicitly state the *purpose* as defined in the criterion: ensuring foreign taxes on one type of income cannot offset U.S. tax on another type of income. The description is procedural rather than purposive.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9620eeef-a685-4f67-8c7e-caaed3794617\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3240, "completion_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 3498}, "latency_s": 1.284733749984298, "request_id": "X9SUaf_9J43hnsEPj-nr0Q8", "raw_response": null}
