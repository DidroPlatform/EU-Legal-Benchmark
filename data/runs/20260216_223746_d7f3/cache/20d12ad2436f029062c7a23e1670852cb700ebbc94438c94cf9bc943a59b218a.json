The test asks: but for the defendant's act or omission, would the harm (here, serious injury to the occupant(s) of the second car) have occurred when it did?\n\n- **Drunk driver (D1)**: But for D1's swerve into the adjacent lane (exacerbated by being double the legal alcohol limit, impairing judgment and reaction), the second car would not have been struck and forced into the median. Factual causation clearly established.\n  \n- **Truck driver (D2)**: But for D2's failure to secure the chair (an omission contrary to Road Traffic Act 1988 (RTA), s 40A and Construction and Use Regulations), the chair would not have fallen, D1 would not have swerved, and no collision would have occurred. Factual causation arguably established (though thin, as it relies on the chain of events).\n\n### Legal Causation (Operating and Substantial Cause; No Novus Actus Interveniens)\nLegal causation requires the defendant's act to be more than de minimis: it must be an \"operating and substantial\" cause of the harm (*R v Smith* [1959] 2 QB 35), with the outcome not too remote. Any **novus actus interveniens** (new intervening act) must not break the chain. Intervening acts break the chain if they are unforeseeable, voluntary, and sufficiently independent (*R v Jordan* [1956] 40 Cr App R 152: grossly negligent medical treatment; *R v Latif* [1996] 1 WLR 104: outrageous importation plot).\n\n#### Application to Drunk Driver (D1)\nLikely charged under RTA 1988, s 1A (causing serious injury by dangerous driving) and/or s 5 (driving with excess alcohol). D1's driving manner (swerving into occupied adjacent lane on a freeway while grossly intoxicated) was objectively dangerous (*R v Woods* [1969] Crim LR 113: judged by reasonable driver standard).\n\n- D1's swerve is the **immediate, direct, and substantial cause** of the collision and crash—no intervening act between swerve and injury.\n- The chair is a relevant circumstance (like a hazard or pedestrian: *R v Marlor* [1970] Crim LR 95), but D1's negligent *response* to it (impaired by alcohol) is the operative cause. Drink-driving foreseeably worsens reactions to hazards (*R v Woodward* [1995] 1 WLR 375).\n- **No novus actus**: The chair does not break D1's chain; it aggravates his dangerousness.\n- **Outcome**: Causation fully satisfied. Conviction highly likely (99%+), with sentencing factoring alcohol (up to 5 years' custody).\n\n#### Application to Truck Driver (D2)\nPossible charges: RTA s 2A (dangerous driving, if load rendered vehicle dangerous); s 40A/insecure load (summary offence, no causation to injury required); remotely, Offences Against the Person Act 1861, s 20/18 (GBH, if intent/recklessness as to some harm).\n\n- D2's omission is an **initial cause** but not substantial or operating at the injury stage—the collision results from D1's swerve, not direct impact with the chair.\n- **Novus actus interveniens**: D1's swerve qualifies as a chain-breaker:\n  - **Voluntary and deliberate**: D1 *chose* to swerve laterally into traffic (not braking/staying course).\n  - **Grossly negligent/criminal**: Double legal limit (160mg+ breath/80mg+ blood) is extreme impairment (*R v Ash [2007] EWCA Crim 2122); swerving into an adjacent car is \"daft\" or \"outrageous\" (*R v Jordan* test), beyond reasonable reactions to a chair.\n  - **Unforeseeable in scope**: While swerves are foreseeable on a freeway (*The Oropesa* [1943] P 32, applied criminally), a *doubly-illegal drunk* colliding laterally is not a natural consequence—truck drivers secure loads anticipating *normal* drivers (*R v Skelton* [1995] Crim LR 635: direct slab-drop liable, but indirect chains harder).\n- Palpably negligent interveners break chains (*R v Hennigan* [1971] 3 All ER 133 distinguished: applies to victim's minor fault in *defendant's* driving case, not vice versa; here D1's 90%+ responsibility).\n- **Outcome**: Causation **not satisfied** for injury-based charges. D2 liable only for strict load offence (fine/points), not the injury. Civil negligence claim stronger (thin skull/eggshell highway? No, third-party negligence limits).\n\n### Overall Likelihood\n- **D1**: Full criminal liability; causation unassailable. Prosecution priority.\n- **D2**: Causation fails due to D1's gross intervention; treated as background hazard.\n- Policy note: RTA offenses prioritize *driver* fault (*R v Bogdal* [1982] Crim LR 404); multi-causal accidents apportion blame, but D1 dominates.\n\nCases like *R v Roberts* [1971] 56 Cr App R 95 (foreseeable panic jump) or *R v Williams* [1992] 2 All ER 183 (foreseeable grab) affirm chains hold for *reasonable* reactions, but D1's is unreasonable/extreme.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 234, "completion_tokens": 4244, "total_tokens": 4478}, "latency_s": 40.445969166001305, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJC64EX4P23QJXB54G74Z5", "raw_response": null}
