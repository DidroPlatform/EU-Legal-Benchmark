{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 0, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires the response to mention at least two distinct types of tenancy breach (e.g., failure to pay rent and damage to property). The response lists common landlord claims, which include 'Rent arrears / non-payment' and 'Breach of covenant (e.g., sub-letting, pet, damage)'. While these are distinct *claims* the landlord might make, the prompt asks what the *tenant* can do to prove they are not in the wrong regarding *breaches*. The response focuses on defending against claims, not explicitly listing two distinct breaches the tenant might have committed and then defended against. However, the table under Section 1 clearly lists 'Rent arrears / non-payment' and 'Breach of covenant (e.g., sub-letting, pet, damage)' as distinct categories of landlord claims, which implies distinct types of potential tenant breaches being alleged. Since the prompt asks what the tenant can do to prove they are not wrong, and the response details defenses against distinct allegations like non-payment of rent and breach of covenant (like sub-letting/pets/damage), it implicitly covers two distinct types of potential breaches being alleged by the landlord. I will count the distinct claims listed in the table as satisfying the requirement for mentioning distinct types of tenancy breach allegations.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8a3d1e61-d07b-42b4-9e15-bf239c2edd27\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4051, "completion_tokens": 316, "total_tokens": 4367}, "latency_s": 1.302142750006169, "request_id": "oO6Uad_tF_ujkdUP0fjD0QU", "raw_response": null}
