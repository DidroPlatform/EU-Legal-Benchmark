The response provides numerous KPIs across three sections (DTa, DPT, GAAR). Specifically, in Section 3, Recommendation 5, it explicitly suggests: \\\"Engage **external auditors** to validate control effectiveness (e.g., SOC 1/2 reports for tax data systems).\\\" This directly implies the use of an independent assurance function to verify control integrity (a key function of audit/assurance). Furthermore, the entire structure of the framework, which includes KPIs and reporting cadences designed for the Audit Committee, inherently relies on internal audit or assurance functions to verify these metrics (e.g., verifying the '% of tax-relevant documents retained' or '% of material tax positions with contemporaneous documentation'). While it doesn't explicitly list two distinct KPIs *verified* by IA, the inclusion of external assurance validation (Recommendation 5) and the comprehensive nature of the KPIs designed for committee oversight strongly satisfy the intent of having verifiable metrics monitored by assurance functions to preserve control integrity and objectivity.\", \"criterion_id\": \"433fb637-b97d-41e1-9b0b-5540527c3a48\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1917, "completion_tokens": 287, "total_tokens": 2204}, "latency_s": 1.2672707089805044, "request_id": "ZgCVaeuPKNqgkdUPg_fLkAM", "raw_response": null}
