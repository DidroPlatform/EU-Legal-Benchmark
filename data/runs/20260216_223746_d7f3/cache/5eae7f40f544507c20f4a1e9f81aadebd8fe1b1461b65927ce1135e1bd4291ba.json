The context of the question implies the driver might have been driving under supervision (as they just failed a practical test), but the answer focuses on the general legality of driving on a foreign license, not the specific L-plate requirement mentioned in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"28d61f08-2c76-49c0-9c19-79d58a2db576\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 826, "completion_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 1015}, "latency_s": 0.7624425840331241, "request_id": "W_aUadSmF-3_nsEPyaqlqAk", "raw_response": null}
