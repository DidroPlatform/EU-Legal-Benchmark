The candidate answer mentions 'Prohibition/Enforcement Notices' under 'Regulatory Outcomes You May Face' and states, 'May prevent use of premises until improvements made.' However, it does not explicitly quote or reference section 7.10, nor does it use the exact phrasing provided in the criterion description regarding the prohibition notice being the most stringent measure that can be taken by an EA (Enforcement Agency) that prohibits or restricts the use of premises. Since the specific reference and detailed description required by the criterion are missing, the criterion is not clearly satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"61747cb7-5391-47be-be91-aa0c1aaf6b6d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2525, "completion_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 2720}, "latency_s": 0.8537332499981858, "request_id": "C86UaY7pJ-6hnsEPsYODsAI", "raw_response": null}
