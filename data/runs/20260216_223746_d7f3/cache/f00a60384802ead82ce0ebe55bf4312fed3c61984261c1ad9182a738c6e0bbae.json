The truck driver's swerving was a reasonable response to an emergency. Courts recognize emergency responses as breaking the chain of causation.' This directly addresses the concept that the intervening act (the swerve in response to the hazard) breaks the chain, absolving the initial actor (the truck driver) of liability for the subsequent crash.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1f01980d-6a77-455d-a337-952c9912c668\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1134, "completion_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 1316}, "latency_s": 5.170910166983958, "request_id": "7OCUaYysBaaGxN8PueC3gQs", "raw_response": null}
