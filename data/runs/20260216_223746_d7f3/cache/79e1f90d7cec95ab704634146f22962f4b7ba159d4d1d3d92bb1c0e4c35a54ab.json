The candidate answer discusses Section 163(j) regarding interest deduction limitations, which is a modern U.S. statutory limitation on interest deductions, but it does not explicitly mention or discuss the common law or statutory 'thin capitalization doctrine' (which often refers to domestic or foreign rules limiting the debt-to-equity ratio for interest deductibility, sometimes referred to as earnings stripping rules in a broader context, or specific local country rules like those often found in Luxembourg). Since the criterion specifically asks for the 'thin capitalization doctrine,' and the response only mentions Section 163(j) in the U.S. context, it fails to meet the specific requirement of the rubric.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8fdccc9f-9087-40ec-b39f-52d653aca87b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3286, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 3502}, "latency_s": 1.1734725839924067, "request_id": "cuOUabnIH_2O28oPtf2OoQ0", "raw_response": null}
