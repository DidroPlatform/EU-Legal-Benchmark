Cease and Desist Letters (Diffida) The first step would typically be to send formal cease and desist letters (diffide) to the vendors through an Italian attorney (avvocato).\\\" Under the US analysis, while the primary enforcement mechanism discussed is federal litigation, the practical recommendations section advises: \\\"2. Engage Italian IP counsel to send cease and desist letters and evaluate provisional measures.\\\" Although the US section focuses on litigation prerequisites (registration), the overall recommendation section, which applies to the entire situation, includes sending cease and desist letters as a primary step, which is standard practice in the US before filing suit.
