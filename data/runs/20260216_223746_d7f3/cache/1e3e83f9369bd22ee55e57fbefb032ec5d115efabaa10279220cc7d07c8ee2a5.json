Under Step 4, Section B, point 1 (Trademark Infringement), it lists 'Damages (compensation for lost profits)' and 'Account of profits' as remedies. Furthermore, in Step 4, Section B, point 2 (Passing Off), it states the remedies are the same as trademark infringement. This directly addresses the requirement to advise that the court can order an Inquiry as to Damages (or Assessment of Damages) to quantify the final monetary remedy.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ed5318c8-5a19-4ea7-8275-294ca2b150f6\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4223, "completion_tokens": 165, "total_tokens": 4388}, "latency_s": 0.6690371250151657, "request_id": "QPiUacChE6L17M8Pt6zc8AU", "raw_response": null}
