Here's what you need to know:\n\n## Key Elements to Establish\n\nTo succeed, you'll typically need to show:\n\n1. **Substantial interference** with use/enjoyment of your property\n   - Courts consider frequency, duration, and intensity\n   - Late-night noise until 2am twice weekly likely qualifies\n   - Your reasonable expectations in South Kensington are relevant\n\n2. **Unreasonableness**\n   - The test is objective: would a reasonable person find this unreasonable?\n   - Factors include: time of day, nature of the area, duration, and whether the defendant took precautions\n   - 2am rock music is difficult to defend as reasonable\n\n3. **Causation**\n   - The neighbour's band directly causes the interference\n\n4. **Damage/loss**\n   - Typically loss of amenity (reduced enjoyment) rather than physical damage\n   - You don't need to prove financial loss, though it helps\n\n## Practical Steps Before Legal Action\n\n- **Document everything**: dates, times, duration, decibel levels if possible\n- **Check local bylaws**: Most councils have noise regulations (typically 11pm-7am restrictions)\n- **Report to local authority**: They can issue enforcement notices under Environmental Protection Act 1990\n- **Send a formal letter**: Often resolves matters without litigation\n- **Consider mediation**: Cheaper and faster than court\n\n## Important Caveats\n\n- Private nuisance claims are expensive and time-consuming\n- Courts are reluctant to grant injunctions (stopping the activity) unless the case is strong\n- Local authority enforcement is usually more effective for noise complaints\n\n**I'd recommend contacting your local council's environmental health team first**—this is often the most practical route.\n\nWould you like guidance on the council complaint process?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 92, "completion_tokens": 428, "total_tokens": 520}, "latency_s": 4.835971874999814, "request_id": "chatcmpl-7b09a4b2-2946-4f86-ab9f-1dab0784823e", "raw_response": null}
