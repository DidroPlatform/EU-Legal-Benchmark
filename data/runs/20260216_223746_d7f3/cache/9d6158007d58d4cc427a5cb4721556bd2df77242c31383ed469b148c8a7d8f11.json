Furthermore, the conclusion section lists 'Urgency (e.g., assets are being dissipated now and the tribunal cannot act quickly)' as a condition for granting the injunction. This directly satisfies the requirement of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e3e3a87e-99b8-4519-ba0a-5428d28b5c3e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2805, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 3015}, "latency_s": 0.8356857080361806, "request_id": "KvqUaaOKDf_DnsEPhPSp6QQ", "raw_response": null}
