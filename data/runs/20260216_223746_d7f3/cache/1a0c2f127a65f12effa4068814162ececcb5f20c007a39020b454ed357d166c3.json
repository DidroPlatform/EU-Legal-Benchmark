However, the prompt explicitly requires the definition of DTA (Deferred Tax Asset) preservation requirements, DPT (Diverted Profits Tax) defense, and GAAR (General Anti-Avoidance Rule) exposure. The candidate defines KPI (Key Performance Indicator) and uses DPT and GAAR, but it fails to explicitly state the meaning of DTA, which is a core component mentioned in the task instructions ('analysis of the DTa preservation requirements'). While DTA is implied by the context of tax risk management, the criterion requires stating the meanings of *all* acronyms used, and DTA is a key one derived from the prompt's context that is not explicitly defined in the response.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3bdf7601-09c0-4c23-90e1-cea5c34bc194\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4125, "completion_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 4365}, "latency_s": 1.0425831250031479, "request_id": "0-GUaceMGZuivdIPlJSD8A4", "raw_response": null}
