The candidate answer states: \\\"The challenge is that excess foreign tax credits in the GILTI basket cannot offset U.S. tax on other categories of income, and they can only be carried forward one year or back one year under Section 904(c).\\\" This statement is factually incorrect regarding GILTI FTCs. Under Section 904(c), excess foreign tax credits in the GILTI basket *cannot* be carried forward or back; they are lost. The reference to Section 904(c) and the one-year carryforward/carryback applies to the general and passive FTC baskets, not the GILTI basket. Because the response incorrectly describes the carryforward/carryback rule for GILTI FTCs, it fails to satisfy the criterion (which implies stating the correct rule, i.e., no carryforward).\", \"criterion_id\": \"fe820b5e-6973-4f26-b09f-c40991ea99b5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3228, "completion_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 3473}, "latency_s": 0.8932427919935435, "request_id": "btSUaeeUEd_x7M8P3PK2gQE", "raw_response": null}
