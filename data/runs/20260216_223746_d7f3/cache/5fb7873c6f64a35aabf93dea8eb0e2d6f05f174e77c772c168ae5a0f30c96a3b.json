The candidate answer proposes using a 'Broker-Led IOR Proxy' where the broker acts as the IOR Agent, and the retailer indemnifies the broker. It mentions VAT handling (Broker uses PVA, retailer registers if necessary) but it does not explicitly state or recommend the necessity of a *separate, back-to-back sales contract* between the French parent and the UK retailer (or the IOR proxy) specifically to manage the VAT liability structure and prevent double taxation/incorrect VAT treatment that arises from the shift from EXW to a DDP/DAP-like structure facilitated by the proxy. The structure described is an agency agreement, not a back-to-back sale, which is the standard mechanism to legally separate the seller's liability from the IOR's liability for VAT purposes in complex import scenarios.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2941285f-f638-4e87-9944-0cebd24bc52b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2312, "completion_tokens": 250, "total_tokens": 2562}, "latency_s": 1.1794022499816492, "request_id": "-CaVaYX8C7yK7M8Ph5iNuAM", "raw_response": null}
