The candidate answer focuses heavily on the user's likely status as a 'licensee / unlawful occupier' due to the lack of rent and formal agreement, and discusses protections against illegal eviction (PEA 1977). While it discusses the necessity of a court order for eviction, which implies the buyer needs a right to possession, it does not explicitly state or highlight the principle that the occupant's claim to occupation (whether as a tenant, licensee, or otherwise) must stem from some recognized legal right in the land (i.e., permission from the owner) to have any protection against the new owner, beyond the basic protection against unlawful eviction afforded to mere trespassers/licensees under the PEA 1977. The core focus is on the *type* of right (licence vs. tenancy) rather than the prerequisite that *a* right must exist for statutory protection to apply beyond basic criminal protections.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8718243c-5ff0-4b5c-8761-fc13dc640746\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3336, "completion_tokens": 262, "total_tokens": 3598}, "latency_s": 1.266409957956057, "request_id": "UeWUaeP1Ec2Lxs0Pm8GNoA8", "raw_response": null}
