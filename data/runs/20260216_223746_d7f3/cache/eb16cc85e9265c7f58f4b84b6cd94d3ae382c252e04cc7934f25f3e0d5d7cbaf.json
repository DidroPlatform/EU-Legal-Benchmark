The candidate answer discusses 'direct representative' (where the client remains liable) and 'indirect representative' (where they become jointly liable) in the context of a customs agent acting as IOR. However, when recommending the immediate solution (Option B), the candidate advises using a 'third-party IOR service provider' who 'become the named importer on the customs declaration.' This structure implies the third party is acting as a Direct Representative (as they are the named importer) or, more commonly in the UK context for non-established entities, as a Direct Representative using a specific authorization, or potentially as a Direct Representative under a specific IOR service model where the liability is contractually managed. Crucially, the response does not explicitly state that the UK Indirect Representative *must* be jointly and severally liable under an indirect representation agreement, which is the specific legal requirement being tested by the criterion. It mentions 'jointly liable' in passing regarding the legacy UCC term but focuses the solution on a third-party IOR acting as the named importer, which often defaults to a direct representation model where the third party is the primary declarant but the liability structure isn't explicitly defined as 'jointly and severally liable under an indirect representation agreement' as required by the criterion's specific legal phrasing.\", \"criterion_id\": \"566fd9ff-4870-40ea-bad8-2cfc7888257d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4376, "completion_tokens": 336, "total_tokens": 4712}, "latency_s": 5.016614209016552, "request_id": "07eUadYPhvWR1Q_witOxBQ", "raw_response": null}
