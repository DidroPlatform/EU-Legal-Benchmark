INCORRECT. Under Swiss law (Art. 190 Federal Constitution), the Federal Supreme Court must apply federal acts (laws passed by the Federal Assembly) even if they are unconstitutional. Switzerland does not have constitutional review of federal legislation - the court cannot annul federal acts.\\n\\nii. INCORRECT. Under the Swiss statutory marital property regime of participation in acquired property (Art. 198 CC), inherited property IS individual property (Eigengut) by operation of law. So the statement saying inherited property does NOT comprise individual property is wrong.\\n\\niii. INCORRECT. The Helvetic Republic (1798-1803) replaced the old confederate structure with a centralized unitary state modeled on the French Republic. It did NOT restore the pre-revolutionary confederate structure - quite the opposite. The confederate structure was later partially restored with the Act of Mediation (1803).\\n\\niv. This refers to Johann Caspar Bluntschli, not Gustave Moynier. Bluntschli wrote 'Das moderne Kriegsrecht' in 1866. Moynier was co-founder of the Red Cross. However, looking more carefully - actually Moynier did write on laws of war but the specific work 'Das moderne Kriegsrecht' (1866) is attributed to Bluntschli. So this statement appears INCORRECT regarding the author.\\n\\nWait, let me reconsider. Actually, checking: 'Das moderne Kriegsrecht der civilisirten Staaten' (1866) was written by Johann Caspar Bluntschli, not Gustave Moynier. So iv is INCORRECT.\\n\\nv. INCORRECT. In Swiss concrete/indirect constitutional review, if a party successfully challenges legislation, only the administrative decision is annulled, NOT the underlying legal provision itself. The legal provision remains in force but is simply not applied in that particular case.\\n\\nSo statements i, ii, iii, iv, and v are all incorrect. But wait - let me reconsider ii more carefully. Art. 198 CC lists individual property including 'property acquired by inheritance.' So inherited property IS individual property. The statement says it 'does not comprise inherited property' - this is incorrect.\\n\\nActually, all five seem incorrect. But looking at option H (all five), let me reconsider iv. Actually, upon reflection, I'm less certain about iv. Let me reconsider the options.\\n\\nGiven the choices, M (i, ii, iii, and v) excludes iv. But iv seems incorrect too. H includes all five. Let me reconsider statement ii once more - inherited property IS part of individual property by operation of law, so saying it 'does not comprise' is wrong.\\n\\nActually, re-reading v: in concrete review, only the decision is annulled, not the underlying provision. So v is incorrect.\\n\\nFor iv: if Bluntschli wrote it, not Moynier, then iv is incorrect too, making all five incorrect (H).\\n\\nBut let me reconsider - maybe Moynier did contribute to this work? I'm fairly confident it was Bluntschli. Going with M (i, ii, iii, v) since I might be wrong about iv, or going with H.\\n\\nActually, I'll go with M because there's a possibility Moynier was involved in some capacity with war law writings in 1866, and the question asks for the 'best' answer.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 398, "completion_tokens": 806, "total_tokens": 1204}, "latency_s": 16.53884570900118, "request_id": "chatcmpl-b94d9f61-7913-4d9e-9c68-d4c03653ecbb", "raw_response": null}
