The candidate answer mentions the \\u00a7163(j) limitation but describes it generally as limiting interest to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income, without specifying the precise calculation method (i.e., whether it uses EBIT or EBITDA, or the specific add-backs/exclusions applicable for the 2022-2024 period). Since the response does not explicitly confirm the specific calculation basis (EBIT vs. EBIT + depreciation/amortization) relevant to the 2022-2024 window as required by the criterion, it fails to satisfy this specific detail.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3c8280f0-10b6-49d2-8467-4d1e817f8930\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2022, "completion_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 2263}, "latency_s": 0.897054583998397, "request_id": "4fKUadn2F6nw7M8Pu5DvyAM", "raw_response": null}
