The candidate answer explicitly discusses Beckford v R, noting it is a Privy Council (PC) decision, and states that the principle was approved by the PC. However, the candidate answer *fails* to advise that Beckford v R is *not binding* domestic UK precedent. In fact, the candidate answer treats Beckford v R as highly persuasive authority supporting the common law position later codified in s.76 CJIA 2008, which is accurate regarding its persuasive weight, but it does not fulfill the specific negative requirement of the rubric criterion, which demands advice that it is *not binding* domestic precedent because it is not UK-based (PC cases are persuasive, not binding on English courts). Since the required negative advice (that it is not binding domestic precedent) is absent, the criterion is not satisfied as written.\", \"criterion_id\": \"bbfa06d0-1d7b-41af-bb76-fa659eee9bd5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2769, "completion_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 3018}, "latency_s": 2.0529190829838626, "request_id": "qsmUaen4Abnu7M8P587SoAI", "raw_response": null}
