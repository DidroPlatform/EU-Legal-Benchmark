This strongly implies a dispute over the truthfulness of statements made about the client's professional conduct (defamation), not a dispute over the terms of employment termination (wrongful dismissal). The candidate answer correctly focuses on the trade-off between financial settlement and reputational damage (defamation/retraction) and discusses the risks of a defamation trial. It does not confuse wrongful dismissal with defamation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"42de87ff-5a4d-4099-838d-b29471e4f2a8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 922, "completion_tokens": 157, "total_tokens": 1079}, "latency_s": 1.1571082909940742, "request_id": "xgmVafucEfKcnsEPtfCWuQg", "raw_response": null}
