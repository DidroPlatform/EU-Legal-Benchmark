This is historically accurate.\n\n**Statement ii**: A contract with a defect in its conclusion is not automatically void. Depending on the defect, it may be voidable (anfechtbar) rather than void (nichtig). For example, contracts concluded under mistake, fraud, or duress are voidable, not void. Only contracts lacking essential elements or violating mandatory law are void. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**Statement iii**: This correctly describes Swiss criminal law. The federal government has primary criminal law authority (Swiss Criminal Code), while cantons can only legislate on contraventions not covered by federal law. This is correct.\n\n**Statement iv**: This accurately describes the statutory marital property regime of participation in acquired property (Errungenschaftsbeteiligung) under Swiss law. Acquired property includes assets obtained for valuable consideration during marriage. This is correct.\n\n**Statement v**: The Federal Council consists of seven equal members with no Prime Minister. The President of the Confederation rotates annually and has only representative functions with no special powers. The Federal Council cannot dissolve the Federal Assembly. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\nStatements ii and v are incorrect.\n\n{\"answer\": \"B\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement ii is incorrect because contracts with defects are typically voidable, not void. Statement v is incorrect because Switzerland has no Prime Minister; the Federal Council has 7 equal members, and the rotating President has no special powers to dissolve the Federal Assembly.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 322, "completion_tokens": 371, "total_tokens": 693}, "latency_s": 6.839804459013976, "request_id": "chatcmpl-cc2f5b06-f2e9-454b-8572-24cd6eef3f33", "raw_response": null}
