The reasoning about examining the information refusal 'as an aspect of his broader grievance' creates a natural bridge from the preceding argument to the legal framework. Options B and D introduce case citations and alternative characterizations that would be less natural continuations, while Option C lacks the contextual reasoning that ties the complaint to Article 8.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 899, "completion_tokens": 155, "total_tokens": 1054}, "latency_s": 2.4836966670118272, "request_id": "chatcmpl-4ed1bc67-b368-48a8-8092-3cc91aa76b4a", "raw_response": null}
