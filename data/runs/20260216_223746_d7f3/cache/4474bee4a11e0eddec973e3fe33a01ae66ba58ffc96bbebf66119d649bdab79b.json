Statement ii is incorrect: Under Roman law, treasure (thesaurus) found on another's land was typically split between finder and landowner, not entirely to the landowner. Statement iii is incorrect: Carl Stooss advocated for sanctions serving multiple purposes including rehabilitation and deterrence, not only retribution. Statement iv is incorrect: Abstract/direct challenges result in rescission of legislation; concrete/indirect challenges result in the administrative decision being repealed, but the provision itself may still be annulled depending on the court's reasoning. Statement v appears correct regarding the Responsible Business Initiative's potential effects. Therefore, statements i, ii, iii, and iv are incorrect.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 562, "completion_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 759}, "latency_s": 3.6774013329995796, "request_id": "chatcmpl-0851a0bc-6102-4219-8edb-885ad8adeb5e", "raw_response": null}
