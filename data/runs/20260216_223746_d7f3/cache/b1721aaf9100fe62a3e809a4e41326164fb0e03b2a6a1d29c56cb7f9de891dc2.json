The candidate answer correctly identifies the data as 'special category data' (health-related) under Article 9 of the GDPR and mentions the need for 'explicit consent' (which is one of the bases listed in Art. 9(2)). However, it does not explicitly state the general rule that processing is prohibited *unless* an exception (like consent or another specific ground listed in Art. 9(2)) applies. It focuses on the requirement for consent rather than the conditionality of processing sensitive data based on the exceptions.\", \"criterion_id\": \"da699e98-14ef-4832-ab6f-e586bce8ec3c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 972, "completion_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 1157}, "latency_s": 0.9154747079883236, "request_id": "FEiUaYiAO4nUvdIP9NigsQ0", "raw_response": null}
