The candidate answer correctly states the general rule: 'A legal charge (mortgage) normally takes priority over an earlier equitable interest (like your constructive trust claim) BUT this depends heavily on whether the lender is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice.' It then proceeds to discuss exceptions (notice, fraud) that could postpone the bank's charge, which aligns with the ground truth that priority is not automatic but depends on notice/overriding status. Therefore, the candidate answer does *not* incorrectly advise that the constructive trust automatically has priority; it correctly frames the issue as one of priority based on notice.\", \"criterion_id\": \"efe892e8-3336-4d58-afc7-6400db760a08\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1796, "completion_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 2014}, "latency_s": 1.1209372500015888, "request_id": "CMyUaeWqOObgnsEP6p2VqQ8", "raw_response": null}
