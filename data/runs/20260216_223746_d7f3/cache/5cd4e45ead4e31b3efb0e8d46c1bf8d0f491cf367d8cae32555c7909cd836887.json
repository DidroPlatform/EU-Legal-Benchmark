Any “workable” design has to be substance-led, not paper-led.\n\nWhat I *can* do is give you the only pragmatic answer that typically survives HMRC: **make Ireland the real entrepreneur** (i.e., actually move the value-creating functions and risk control to Ireland), and then let the profit follow that substance. If the client’s primary non-negotiable is “>50% of residual profit in Ireland”, the recommendation is:\n\n## Final pragmatic recommendation (HMRC-defensible)\n### Implement a **substance migration** model: Ireland as principal/entrepreneur + UK as routine service provider\n\n**Structure (high level):**\n1. **Irish Principal (IPCo)**: Irish company becomes the contracting entity with customers (or at least the key contracting entity for the relevant markets), owns/controls the key IP (or is the economic owner with real DEMPE), and *actually* makes the strategic decisions and controls the economically significant risks.\n2. **UK Co**: becomes a **limited-risk service provider** to IPCo (e.g., development/engineering services, sales/marketing support, customer success, back-office), remunerated on a **routine cost-plus** or **TNMM** basis.\n3. **IP and people alignment**: either\n   - (a) **Transfer/migrate IP and DEMPE** to Ireland (with a proper valuation/exit charge where required), or\n   - (b) build **new IP** in Ireland going forward, with the key people and decision-making moving as well (and the UK doing support work under contract).\n4. **Governance reality**: Irish board, Irish executives, Irish risk committee/approvals; UK cannot be the de facto mind-and-management for the Irish principal.\n\n**Why this is the only “hybrid” that routinely holds up:**\n- HMRC generally accepts outcomes where **profit allocation mirrors real functions/assets/risks**.\n- If Ireland truly controls the residual drivers (strategy, product roadmap, pricing, customer contracting, IP DEMPE, capital allocation), then **>50% residual in Ireland** can be defensible.\n\n## What this means in practice (non-negotiables)\nIf the client won’t accept these, they shouldn’t expect HMRC to accept >50% residual shift:\n\n- **Senior decision-makers move** (or at least a material portion of C‑suite/VP level who control risks and IP decisions must be Ireland-based).\n- **Contracting and revenue flow** meaningfully changes (not just “UK sells but Ireland invoices” unless the Irish principal genuinely controls the sales function and bears/reviews the risk).\n- **Control of risk** moves (budget authority, hiring/firing authority, product investment decisions, key supplier decisions, IP enforcement decisions).\n- **Transfer pricing file** will need to show UK is routine and Ireland is entrepreneurial; this must match operational reality.\n\n## The closest “alternative hybrid” people try—and why it usually fails\nTo address your direct ask: structures like “Irish IP owner + UK distributor/commissionaire” or “Irish limited risk principal while UK does the work” can appear “hybrid”, but **if UK people are still doing DEMPE and controlling the risks**, HMRC reattributes profit to the UK and/or asserts **DPT**. These aren’t reliably defensible without the substance migration described above.\n\n## So the recommendation, stated plainly\nIf the commercial requirement is **majority residual profit in Ireland**, the pragmatic route is:\n\n**Rebuild the operating model so that Ireland genuinely performs and controls the key value creation (entrepreneurial/risk/IP functions), and the UK is routine.**  \nAnything else is essentially asking for a structure that “looks Irish” while “acts UK”, and that’s exactly the fact pattern HMRC is set up to attack.\n\n## Two implementation options (depending on appetite)\n1. **Full principal model from Day 1**: cleaner defensibility, bigger operational change (people, contracts, systems).\n2. **Phased migration** (still substance-led): move contracting + key leadership first, then migrate DEMPE/IP in stages; accept that **profit split won’t be >50% Ireland until substance is**.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me (i) where the key executives currently sit, (ii) where contracting happens, (iii) what the “residual profit” is driven by (IP vs market/sales vs operations), and (iv) whether the client is willing to relocate senior roles, I can map the **minimum substance change** required for “>50% Ireland” to be credible and what HMRC attack points remain.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 108, "completion_tokens": 1080, "total_tokens": 1188}, "latency_s": 20.544072249991586, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJ2SDFRM6J7KNAMQV4S4R2", "raw_response": null}
