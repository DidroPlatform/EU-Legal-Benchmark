Stone & Rolls Ltd*). Instead, the candidate pivots entirely to Swiss law (OR, SchKG, ZGB), stating assumptions about applying Swiss principles analogously. This fundamentally violates the requirement to address the specific legal issue presented in the context, which clearly points towards English common law principles regarding the *ex turpi causa* defense in auditor liability following insolvency. The reference answer correctly identifies the relevant common law case (*Moore Stephens v. Stone & Rolls Ltd*) and applies the principle that the defense is generally defeated when innocent parties (shareholders/creditors represented by the liquidator) are involved. The candidate's analysis based on Swiss law is irrelevant to the prompt's implied jurisdiction and context.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.1}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2988, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 3211}, "latency_s": 0.915235708002001, "request_id": "QSKVaaevNKOF7M8P9PzH6Ag", "raw_response": null}
