CORRECT. In Switzerland, the debt enforcement procedure (Betreibung) allows a creditor to initiate enforcement proceedings by requesting a payment order (Zahlungsbefehl). If the debtor does not file an objection (Rechtsvorschlag) within 10 days, the creditor can proceed with enforcement without obtaining a court judgment.\\n\\nii. CORRECT. Under Swiss law, parties can normally appeal decisions of the last cantonal instance to the Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgericht) through various remedies (Beschwerde in Zivilsachen, subsidiäre Verfassungsbeschwerde), subject to certain thresholds and conditions.\\n\\niii. CORRECT. The treasure found on another's property (thesaurus) was indeed a classical Roman law problem that raised the question of whether possession could be acquired without knowledge. This relates to the debate about animus possidendi and whether the landowner possessed the treasure without knowing about it.\\n\\niv. CORRECT. Under Swiss Code of Obligations (Art. 31), a party who discovers a fundamental error (or other defect in consent) must declare the non-binding nature of the contract within one year of discovering the defect; otherwise, the contract is deemed ratified.\\n\\nv. INCORRECT. Posters and TV spots published as part of an official information campaign are generally not considered administrative decisions (Verfügungen) and therefore cannot be directly appealed. They are considered real acts (Realakte) rather than formal decisions that create, modify, or extinguish legal rights and obligations.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 560, "completion_tokens": 367, "total_tokens": 927}, "latency_s": 7.880629792023683, "request_id": "chatcmpl-c516bcc3-ba99-4d03-807c-2f1e3a11df30", "raw_response": null}
