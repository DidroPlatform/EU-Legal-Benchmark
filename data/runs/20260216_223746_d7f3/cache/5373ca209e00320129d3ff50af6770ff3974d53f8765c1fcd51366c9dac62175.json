However, for other international law violations including ECHR, the Federal Assembly can declare an initiative invalid only if it violates jus cogens. Initiatives violating \"regular\" international law like ECHR may proceed to vote. This statement is **incorrect** - it's too broad.\n\n**Statement ii**: Swiss civil procedure does NOT apply such a broad res judicata concept. Res judicata is limited to the specific claim decided and doesn't make all factual findings and legal assessments binding for all subsequent disputes between parties. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**Statement iii**: This describes the \"dissensus\" theory. However, Swiss contract law follows the \"trust principle\" (Vertrauensprinzip). When both interpretations are equally admissible, the contract is typically valid based on what a reasonable person would understand. The statement claiming no contract exists is **incorrect**.\n\n**Statement iv**: In Swiss inheritance law, the 2nd parentel (Parentel/Stamm) consists of the deceased's parents and their descendants (siblings, nieces, nephews of the deceased). This statement is **correct**.\n\nStatements i, ii, and iii are incorrect.\n\nLooking at the options, this corresponds to option A (all four) or options that include i, ii, and iii but not iv alone.\n\nThe closest match is **B. i and ii** or we need i, ii, and iii together, which isn't perfectly listed except in A.\n\nActually, reviewing: i, ii, and iii are incorrect; iv is correct. This isn't perfectly matched, but the best answer appears to be **D. ii and iii** if we're being conservative, or we recognize that i is also incorrect.\n\n{\"answer\": \"A\", \"reasoning\": \"Statements i, ii, and iii are incorrect under Swiss law. Statement i overstates invalidity requirements for initiatives; ii incorrectly describes res judicata scope; iii misapplies contract formation principles. Statement iv correctly describes the 2nd parentel in inheritance law.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens": 488, "total_tokens": 828}, "latency_s": 10.462135999987368, "request_id": "chatcmpl-271e7949-7bb0-4d07-a399-9624910d0e6e", "raw_response": null}
