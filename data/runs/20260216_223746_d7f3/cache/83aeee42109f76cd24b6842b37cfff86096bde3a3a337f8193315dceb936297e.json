This is practical (not legal advice), but it will help you spot the “must-haves” and the common traps. For anything you’re unsure about, it’s worth having a UK lawyer and a Canadian lawyer review—distribution agreements are very jurisdiction-specific.\n\n## 1) Structure: distributor vs agent (make sure it’s really a distributor)\n- **Distributor** buys from you and resells in their own name (they carry more commercial risk).\n- **Agent** sells on your behalf (you often carry more risk, plus different tax/regulatory implications).\n**Contract should clearly state**: who invoices the end customer, who takes title to goods, who bears credit risk, and who is the “importer of record”.\n\n## 2) Territory & exclusivity (often the biggest value point)\n- **Territory definition**: Canada only, or specific provinces? Include online sales and cross-border into the US.\n- **Exclusivity**: exclusive / non-exclusive / sole. If exclusive:\n  - Add **performance conditions** (minimum purchases, sales targets, active accounts, marketing spend).\n  - Include **loss of exclusivity** if targets aren’t met.\n- **House accounts**: keep rights to sell to named strategic customers (or existing customers) directly.\n- **Channel restrictions**: e.g., no Amazon/eBay, no discount outlets, no selling outside agreed channels.\n\n## 3) Term, renewal, and exit (avoid being “locked in”)\n- **Initial term**: often 1–3 years.\n- **Renewal**: automatic only if targets met and no breaches.\n- **Termination**:\n  - For cause (non-payment, insolvency, IP misuse, corruption, unlawful sales, breach of brand rules).\n  - For convenience (e.g., 60–180 days’ notice) if commercially acceptable.\n- **Post-termination**:\n  - **Sell-off period** (limited time/quantity) with strict rules.\n  - Return/destruction of marketing materials, customer data, confidential info.\n  - Clear treatment of warranty/returns after termination.\n\n## 4) Products, pricing, and ordering (make it operationally tight)\n- **Product scope**: list SKUs; who controls additions/discontinuations.\n- **Forecasting**: distributor provides rolling forecasts; you confirm orders only when accepted.\n- **Pricing**:\n  - Wholesale price list currency (GBP or CAD) and **price-change mechanism** (notice period).\n  - Explicitly state you can adjust prices for FX, materials, freight, tariffs.\n- **Payment terms**: proforma / net 30 / credit limit; interest on late payment; security if needed.\n- **No “most favoured nation”** clauses unless you truly can comply.\n\n## 5) Incoterms, delivery, and risk (critical in cross-border trade)\nSpecify **Incoterms 2020** and named place/port, e.g.:\n- **EXW UK**, **FCA UK port**, **CIP Toronto**, **DAP distributor warehouse**, etc.\nDefine clearly:\n- When **title** and **risk of loss** transfer.\n- Who arranges and pays **freight** and **insurance**.\n- Who handles **customs clearance**, duties/tariffs, and is **importer of record**.\n- Packaging standards, palletisation, lead times, partial shipments.\n\n## 6) Regulatory compliance in Canada (who is responsible for what)\nThis is often overlooked and can become expensive.\n- **Canadian standards/labels**: bilingual labelling (English/French) may be required depending on product category.\n- Product-specific rules (examples):\n  - Electrical/electronics: certification marks (CSA/UL etc.), NRCan energy efficiency rules.\n  - Food/cosmetics/health products: CFIA/Health Canada rules.\n  - Chemicals: WHMIS/SDS requirements.\n- Contract should allocate:\n  - Who ensures compliance, files registrations, maintains technical files.\n  - Who pays for testing/certification/translation.\n  - Who bears the cost of non-compliance, recalls, penalties.\n\n## 7) Marketing, brand control, and online sales\n- **Brand guidelines**: approval rights over packaging, translations, ads, websites.\n- **Use of trademarks**: limited licence, no registration by distributor, no domain names/social handles without consent.\n- **Digital**: rules for online marketplaces, geo-blocking, pricing display, use of your images/content.\n\n## 8) Minimum performance & reporting (so you can manage from the UK)\n- **KPIs**: minimum annual purchase volumes, number of active dealers, marketing activities.\n- **Reporting**: quarterly sales reports by SKU, customer segment, inventory levels, pipeline/forecast.\n- **Audit rights**: limited right to inspect relevant records (esp. for royalty/IP issues, returns, warranty claims).\n\n## 9) Warranty, returns, and product liability (very important)\n- Define your **manufacturer warranty** and what the distributor may promise downstream.\n- Who handles:\n  - Returns/defects diagnosis\n  - Spare parts/service\n  - Replacement product costs and shipping\n- **Product liability**:\n  - Distributor should carry **product liability insurance** in Canada with specified limits and name you as additional insured.\n  - Indemnities: each party covers liabilities caused by their negligence, misrepresentation, improper storage/installation, or unauthorised modifications/claims.\n\n## 10) Inventory, stock rotation, and end-of-life products\n- Rules on stockholding, storage conditions, FIFO rotation, expiry dates (if applicable).\n- Obsolescence: who pays for old packaging when labels change; handling discontinued SKUs.\n- Buy-back terms (often you should avoid mandatory buy-back unless tightly limited).\n\n## 11) Non-compete / non-solicit (be careful but protect yourself)\n- Reasonable **non-compete** may be enforceable only if narrowly drafted (scope/time).\n- At minimum:\n  - No competing products that are “confusingly similar”.\n  - No poaching of your staff or key suppliers.\n  - No using your confidential info to develop a competing line.\n\n## 12) Confidentiality & data (including customer lists)\n- Strong confidentiality obligations.\n- Make clear who “owns”:\n  - Customer data and CRM entries\n  - Market intel, leads generated\n- Privacy law compliance: Canada has federal and provincial privacy regimes; set obligations for lawful marketing/emailing.\n\n## 13) Anti-bribery, sanctions, ethical trade\nAs a UK company, you must care about the **UK Bribery Act**.\n- Include anti-corruption warranties, audit/cooperation clauses, and termination rights.\n- Sanctions/export controls compliance if products have restricted end uses.\n\n## 14) Dispute resolution, governing law, and practical enforcement\n- Decide **governing law** and **courts/arbitration**.\n  - UK law may be familiar, but enforcement in Canada matters.\n  - Sometimes a neutral arbitration clause is easiest.\n- Include language on attorneys’ fees/costs if you win.\n- Consider whether Quebec-specific language rules affect contracts if operating heavily in Quebec.\n\n## 15) Currency, taxes, and “who pays what”\n- Currency (GBP/CAD), payment method, bank charges.\n- Withholding taxes are usually more relevant to royalties/services than sale of goods, but:\n  - If you charge for **marketing services, commissions, IP royalties**, get tax advice.\n- Clarify whether prices are inclusive/exclusive of GST/HST/PST (usually distributor handles sales taxes as seller of record).\n\n---\n\n# Clauses that commonly cause problems (red flags)\n- **Perpetual exclusivity** or very long terms with no performance exit.\n- Distributor can register **your trademarks** or hold domains.\n- You must **buy back all stock** on termination at full price.\n- Broad **most-favoured pricing** promises.\n- Vague Incoterms / unclear importer-of-record responsibility.\n- Distributor can make **warranty claims or marketing statements** without your approval.\n\n---\n\n## Quick checklist of “definitely have in the contract”\n1. Clear distributor model: title/risk transfer; importer of record; who invoices end customers.  \n2. Territory + (if exclusive) targets + automatic loss of exclusivity if missed.  \n3. Incoterms 2020 + delivery lead times + who pays duties/taxes/freight/insurance.  \n4. Payment terms + credit limits + late-payment remedies.  \n5. Regulatory compliance allocation (labelling, certifications, translations).  \n6. Brand/IP protection + approval rights + no trademark registrations/domains.  \n7. Product liability/warranty framework + insurance requirements + indemnities.  \n8. Term/termination + sell-off rules + post-termination obligations.  \n9. Reporting/KPIs/audit rights.  \n10. Governing law + dispute resolution + enforcement practicality.\n\n---\n\n## A few questions that would let me tailor this to your situation\n1) What kind of products are they (electrical, food, cosmetics, industrial parts, etc.)?  \n2) Will the distributor be **exclusive**? Whole Canada or certain provinces?  \n3) Do you want them to handle **importing and compliance**, or do you plan to?  \n4) Do you already have any Canadian customers or inbound enquiries you want to keep as “house accounts”?  \n5) Are you planning to sell online into Canada yourself?\n\nIf you share what you manufacture and whether the proposal is exclusive, I can suggest a more specific “deal structure” and a set of clauses to negotiate first.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 58, "completion_tokens": 1998, "total_tokens": 2056}, "latency_s": 42.00568358399323, "request_id": "gen_01KHNHZTX3RK7V3AQZZST68TZP", "raw_response": null}
