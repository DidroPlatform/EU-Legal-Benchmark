He published \"A Memory of Solferino\" in 1862. This statement is **incorrect** - it wrongly attributes his influence to the American Civil War.\n\n**Statement ii:** In Swiss criminal proceedings, mandatory defense counsel is required in certain serious cases (e.g., felonies, cases where the accused lacks capacity). The accused cannot always refuse representation. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**Statement iii:** This describes the principle of dissensus (lack of consensus). However, Swiss contract law applies the principle of trust/reliance (Vertrauensprinzip) - the objective interpretation prevails over subjective intent. When both interpretations are equally admissible, the contract may still exist based on objective standards. The statement's absolute claim that \"no contract has ever come to legal existence\" is **incorrect** as it oversimplifies Swiss contract law principles.\n\n**Statement iv:** The Swiss Code of Obligations was enacted in 1881 (effective 1883) and did include general obligations, contracts, torts, and commercial law provisions. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Statement v:** In Swiss law, a limited liability company (GmbH/Sàrl) does limit shareholder liability to their investment. This is a fundamental principle of limited liability companies. This statement is **correct**.\n\nIncorrect statements: i, ii, and iii\n\nLooking at the options, option C states \"i and ii\" which captures two incorrect statements but misses iii. However, reviewing more carefully, statement iii's incorrectness depends on interpretation. Let me reconsider if the most clearly incorrect are i and ii.\n\nThe answer is **C** (i and ii are clearly incorrect).\n\n{\"answer\": \"C\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement i incorrectly attributes Dunant's influence to the American Civil War rather than the Battle of Solferino. Statement ii incorrectly claims the accused never needs mandatory defense counsel, when Swiss law requires it in serious cases.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 330, "completion_tokens": 473, "total_tokens": 803}, "latency_s": 9.572872708988143, "request_id": "chatcmpl-31098019-357f-489f-9905-e0da71d0655a", "raw_response": null}
