The candidate answer discusses foreseeability extensively, referencing *R v Roberts* and the need for the reaction to be 'daft' or unforeseeable. It focuses on whether the *type* of reaction (swerving) was foreseeable, given the hazard. However, it never explicitly links the foreseeability analysis to the *time* the chair was present, which is the specific element required by the criterion (i.e., whether the driver had time to react safely, or if the hazard appeared too suddenly). The analysis focuses on the *nature* of the reaction (swerving) rather than the *timing* of the hazard presentation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"53430ddb-2da1-464a-af19-ff799ad6064e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2721, "completion_tokens": 239, "total_tokens": 2960}, "latency_s": 1.1904484579863492, "request_id": "w8KUadrbJcSzkdUP4ZaoqQU", "raw_response": null}
