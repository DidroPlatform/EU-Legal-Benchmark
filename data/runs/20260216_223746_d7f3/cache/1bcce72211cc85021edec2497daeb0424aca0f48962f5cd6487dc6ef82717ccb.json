More critically, the answer does not explicitly state that *under the NI Protocol* (which is what the criterion implies by referencing the initial state leading to the DUP boycott and the need for the Framework), the presumption was that all NI-bound goods were 'at risk' unless the importer proved otherwise. It discusses the Framework's current state, not the Protocol's initial presumption as requested by the criterion's focus.\", \"criterion_id\": \"61afe06c-4c7c-460c-8a2e-3ba3157cf84e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1296, "completion_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 1539}, "latency_s": 1.1462852080003358, "request_id": "0BGVaeeDB_HXvdIP-aPZgQM", "raw_response": null}
