The candidate answer focuses heavily on structural solutions (UK subsidiary, IOR changes, customs rulings, insurance) and contractual amendments with the retailer. While it discusses amending the contract (Section 8), this is framed as imposing terms on the retailer rather than reaching a mutual, negotiated agreement to resolve the IOR/liability issue outside of the proposed structural changes or formal rulings. It does not explicitly mention or suggest a 'negotiated settlement' as a distinct alternative strategy in the sense of finding a middle ground agreement with the retailer or other parties to bypass the need for the complex structural setup or formal rulings.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3d32006b-4c2e-4e17-ba68-4187c3803e7e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2832, "completion_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 3037}, "latency_s": 2.3208715000073425, "request_id": "dNqUaYHsD9KdvdIPko7omQ8", "raw_response": null}
