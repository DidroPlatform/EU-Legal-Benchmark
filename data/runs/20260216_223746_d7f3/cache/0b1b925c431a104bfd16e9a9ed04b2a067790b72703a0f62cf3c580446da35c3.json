The candidate answer discusses Spain's reservation regarding Article 9(5) and 9(6) in section 4, stating that Spain's reservation makes those articles binding only if the other party (Belgium) has *not* made the reservation under Article 14(3). However, the criterion specifically asks to identify that a Contracting Party *may reserve the right to not apply* Article 9(5) under Article 14(3). The candidate answer correctly identifies the *effect* of Spain's reservation which references Article 14(3), but it does not explicitly state the general right granted by Article 14(3) itself (i.e., the right of a Contracting Party to make such a reservation). Furthermore, the analysis in section 4 is confusing and focuses on Spain's reservation rather than the general provision of Article 14(3) allowing *any* party to reserve the right regarding Article 9(5). Since the core requirement of identifying the right granted by Article 14(3) is not clearly and directly stated, the criterion is not satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"criterion 6\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1597, "completion_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 1885}, "latency_s": 1.138339375029318, "request_id": "GiKVaZeuAtHMkdUPjY-7sAQ", "raw_response": null}
