The response explicitly discusses PAT testing as the 'standard industry practice' but frames the underlying legal duty under the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (EWR) and PUWER 1998 as requiring equipment to be 'maintained in safe condition.' While it doesn't explicitly list alternative methods, by focusing on the general duty to maintain safety under EWR and PUWER, and contrasting it with the specific practice of PAT testing, it implies that compliance is about the *state* of the equipment, not solely the *act* of PAT testing itself. Furthermore, the response correctly identifies the legal basis for electrical safety (EWR 1989) and discusses the broader context of equipment safety (PUWER 1998), which covers maintenance beyond just PAT testing of portable items. This satisfies the spirit of the criterion by grounding the discussion in the primary regulations rather than solely relying on PAT testing as the sole compliance mechanism.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8f03071f-4174-476a-aaad-a897fa9c3bfb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2854, "completion_tokens": 274, "total_tokens": 3128}, "latency_s": 1.043047834013123, "request_id": "2NyUacbrEaGkvdIPktLvwQ4", "raw_response": null}
