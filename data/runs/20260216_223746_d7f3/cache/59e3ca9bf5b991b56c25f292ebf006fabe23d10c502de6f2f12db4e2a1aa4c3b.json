Executive Summary\nYour client's account – that he was first attacked by the victim, genuinely feared for his life due to a (mistaken) belief that the victim was armed, and only then struck the victim with a piece of broken glass – provides a viable basis for arguing self-defence. Self-defence is a complete justification under common law and statute, negating criminal liability if established.  \n\nThe defence succeeds if: (i) the client honestly believed force was necessary; and (ii) the force used was reasonable in the circumstances *as he believed them to be*. An honest but mistaken belief (e.g., that the victim was armed) is sufficient; it need not be reasonable (*Beckford v R* [1988] AC 130). Prospects are **strong on necessity** (first attack + fear for life) but **finely balanced on proportionality** (use of broken glass as an improvised weapon). Success turns on jury evaluation of the client's credibility, supported by any witness/medical evidence of the initial attack and his injuries/state of mind. Acquittal is realistic (c.50-70% chance if facts as stated), but risks remain due to the weapon's lethality.\n\n## 2. Legal Framework: Key Elements of the Test for Reasonable Force\nSelf-defence is governed by a blend of **common law** and **statute**, codified and clarified by **s.76 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (CJIA 2008)**, which applies retrospectively and reflects the pre-existing law (*R v Ray* [2015] EWCA Crim 199).\n\n### 2.1 Statutory Test (s.3(1) Criminal Law Act 1967 + s.76 CJIA 2008)\n- **s.3(1) CLA 1967**: \"A person may use such force as is **reasonable in the circumstances** in the prevention of crime, or in effecting a lawful arrest.\" This justifies force against an actual or reasonably believed threat of unlawful force (*R v Faraj* [2007] EWCA Crim 1380).\n- **s.76 CJIA 2008** (mandatory jury directions):\n  | Subsection | Key Element |\n  |-------------|-------------|\n  | **s.76(2)-(3)** | Force reasonable if the defendant (**D**) **believed** it was not disproportionate to the threat of **violence against D or another** (considering seriousness, immediacy, and proportionality). |\n  | **s.76(4)** | Reasonableness judged by **circumstances as D believed them to be** (even if mistaken). |\n  | **s.76(5)** | If D **honestly believed** force was needed for self-defence/prevention of crime, test applies to that belief. |\n  | **s.76(6)-(7)** | No 'retreat' duty; pre-emptive force allowed if threat imminent (*Palmer v R* [1971] AC 814). Householder presumption irrelevant here. |\n  | **s.76(8)** | Directions must warn jury against hindsight/judging by actual events. |\n\n### 2.2 Common Law Test (Two-Stage Subjective/Objective Hybrid)\nDeveloped pre-CJIA but unchanged (*Attorney General's Reference (No 2 of 1983)* [1984] QB 456):\n1. **Subjective Stage**: Was there a **genuine/honest belief** in imminent danger requiring force? (No need for reasonableness of belief – see s.3 below.)\n2. **Objective Stage**: Was the **force used reasonable/objectively proportionate** in the circumstances *as believed*? Jury assesses quantum/necessity/type of force.\n\nThe test is **jury question** (*s.76(1) CJIA*); prosecution bears burden once raised (*s.76(5)*).\n\n## 3. Impact of Honest but Mistaken Belief\nA **mistaken belief** in facts (e.g., victim armed) does **not defeat the defence** if honestly held. The belief \"colours\" the circumstances for assessing reasonableness (*R v Owino* (No.2) [1996] 2 Cr App R 128). This protects those acting on incomplete information in \"heat of the moment.\"\n\n### 3.1 Key Principles\n- Belief must be **honest** (not deliberately fabricated) but need **not be reasonable** (*Beckford v R* [1988] AC 130, PC Jamaica: police officer shot fleeing suspect honestly believing he was armed/dangerous; mistaken belief sufficient as jury should assess force on \"facts as he believed them\").\n- Applies to **necessity** (need for *any* force) *and proportionality* (*R v Williams (Gladstone)* (1987) 78 Cr App R 276: D mistakenly believed victim was assaulting a woman; punched him. Belief imputed; defence succeeded despite mistake).\n- **Limits**:\n  | Scenario | Impact |\n  |----------|--------|\n  | **Intoxication** | Mistake induced by drink/drugs *not excused* (*R v O'Grady* [1987] QB 995; *Hatton* [2005] EWCA Crim 2951). |\n  | **Excessive force** | Honest belief in threat does not justify disproportionate response (*R v Clegg* [1995] 1 AC 482: excessive shots after threat passed). |\n  | **Hindsight ban** | Jury ignores actual facts (*DPP v Armstrong-Braun* [1999] Crim LR 417: mistaken belief in burglary justified force). |\n\n### 3.2 Application to Facts\n- **Honest belief**: Client's fear (victim attacked first + believed armed) likely genuine (street altercation; imminent threat). No intoxication alleged.\n- **Imputed circumstances**: Jury assesses as if victim *was* armed (life-threatening). Glass strike then potentially proportionate to disarm/stop deadly attack.\n- **Risks**: Broken glass = \"dangerous weapon\" (*R v Wood* [2012] EWCA Crim 830: bottles/glass heighten scrutiny). If strike post-threat neutralised, or gratuitous, fails (*Palmer*: \"long spoon\" warning on retaliation).\n\n## 4. Prospects of Success\n| Strength | Defence Point | Supporting Evidence Needed |\n|----------|---------------|----------------------------|\n| **High** | Initial attack + fear for life = necessity. Mistaken armed belief protected (*Beckford*). | Client injuries; witnesses; no retreat viable. |\n| **Medium** | Proportionality: Glass as improvised response to perceived deadly threat (*Owino*). | Brief/single strike; victim's aggression/size/weapon hints. |\n| **Low** | Weapon lethality; GBH level injury risks \"disproportionate\" verdict (*Clegg*). | Medicals (client vs victim injuries); CCTV/timing. |\n\n**Overall**: **Good prospects** (jury acquittal likely if account believed; CPS drop possible pre-trial). Argue *no case* if prosecution evidence weak (*Galbraith* [1981] 1 WLR 1039). Recommend character refs, psych report on fear (if trauma).\n\n**Strategy**:\n- Plead not guilty; advance self-defence in basis of plea.\n- Jury directions: Insist on *s.76* full text; Owino/Beckford.\n- Alternatives: s.18 downgrade if fails.\n\n**Authorities**: Full cites in skeleton.
