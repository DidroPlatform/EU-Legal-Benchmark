{"provider": "mistral_api", "model": "mistral/magistral-medium-latest", "text": "To safeguard your minority position and ensure a viable exit, the following provisions are typically considered critical:\n\n1. **Veto Rights**: These are essential for protecting your investment by ensuring that major decisions (such as selling the company, issuing new shares, or changing the articles of association) require your consent. Under German law, certain major decisions already require a supermajority, but additional veto rights can be justified as a way to protect your investment.\n\n2. **Tag-Along Rights**: These rights ensure that if the founders sell their shares, you can sell your shares on the same terms. This is a common practice in venture capital investments and can be justified as a way to ensure that minority shareholders are not left behind in a sale.\n\n3. **Drag-along Rights**: These rights allow a majority shareholder to force a sale of the company, but they also ensure that all shareholders, including minorities, benefit from the sale on the same terms. This is also a common practice and can be justified as a way to ensure that all shareholders can benefit from a sale of the company.\n\n4. **Information Rights**: While German law provides some statutory information rights, additional rights can be justified as a way to ensure transparency and allow you to monitor your investment effectively.\n\n5. **Exit Rights**: Provisions that define what constitutes a liquidity event and how proceeds are distributed are crucial for ensuring that you have a way to realize your investment if the company does not go public or is not sold.\n\nTo justify these asks to the founders under German law and market practice, you can point out that these provisions are common in venture capital investments and are designed to protect the interests of all shareholders. They are also consistent with German corporate law, which allows for a great deal of flexibility in the shareholders' agreement.\n\nHere is a suggested way to present these provisions to the founders:\n\n- **Veto Rights**: \"To protect our investment, we would like to have veto rights on major decisions such as selling the company, issuing new shares, or changing the articles of association. This is consistent with German corporate law and common market practice.\"\n\n- **Tag-Along Rights**: \"We would like to include tag-along rights to ensure that if you sell your shares, we can sell our shares on the same terms. This is a standard provision in venture capital investments.\"\n\n- **Drag-along Rights**: \"We would like to include drag-along rights to ensure that if a majority shareholder wants to sell the company, all shareholders can benefit from the sale on the same terms. This is also a common practice.\"\n\n- **Information Rights**: \"To effectively monitor our investment, we would like to have regular financial and operational information about the company. While German law provides some statutory information rights, additional rights would ensure transparency.\"\n\n- **Exit Rights**: \"To ensure that we have a way to realize our investment, we would like to include provisions that define what constitutes a liquidity event and how proceeds are distributed.\"\n\nBy focusing on these critical provisions and justifying them based on German law and market practice, you can negotiate effectively with the founders while keeping the shareholders' agreement relatively simple.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 124, "completion_tokens": 1657, "total_tokens": 1781}, "latency_s": 47.24980229200446, "request_id": "245982971c2c4990844ce917cc839e25", "raw_response": null}
