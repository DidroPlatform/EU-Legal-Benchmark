The analysis correctly maps the roles (Controller/Processor) and suggests appropriate mitigation measures (encryption, contractual safeguards, compliance programs).\\n\\nHowever, the candidate answer introduces a significant, unprompted focus on Swiss law (DSG), despite the provenance being 'canonical:reference_qa' and the context involving a Norwegian company (X AS) outsourcing to Ireland (EEA) and expanding to India. While the reference answer implicitly covers GDPR (which Norway adheres to via EEA), the candidate's deep dive into Swiss law (e.g., Art. 2 DSG, Art. 16 DSG) is speculative and deviates from the most direct legal framework suggested by the facts (Norwegian company, Irish provider).\\n\\nThe reference answer is more direct in applying the GDPR framework (Art. 6, 9, 3, 48) and the UK Bribery Act/FCPA, which are the most relevant extraterritorial/cross-border laws suggested by the facts (EEA outsourcing, US parent, Indian expansion). The candidate's structure is excellent, but the legal focus is slightly misaligned by prioritizing Swiss law over the implied GDPR/EEA context.\\n\\nSpecifically, the reference answer correctly flags the CLOUD Act risk as a breach of Art. 48 GDPR, which is a more direct application than the candidate's discussion of Swiss Art. 16 DSG analogue to Schrems II.\\n\\nScore is high due to comprehensive coverage of risks (Data Protection, Corruption, Cloud Models) but penalized for the unnecessary and speculative focus on Swiss law.\",\n\"criteria\": {\n\"overall\": 0.65\n}\n}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2848, "completion_tokens": 426, "total_tokens": 3274}, "latency_s": 1.70368195802439, "request_id": "RyKVaeqWKKPwnsEPgLOouAM", "raw_response": null}
