Your Potential Claim (Constructive Trust)'. It states that a constructive trust results in an equitable interest (a share of ownership), while the equitable lien (though not explicitly named, the concept of a right to have a debt paid from the property is implied when discussing the priority of the bank's charge over the claimant's interest) is distinct from the ownership share sought via the trust. More directly, the response contrasts the constructive trust (equitable interest/share) with the bank's legal charge (priority), which is the core distinction required by the criterion, as the equitable interest is what is vulnerable to the prior legal charge.\", \"criterion_id\": \"944e2205-52aa-406d-b061-82df0456fa31\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2115, "completion_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 2309}, "latency_s": 0.7973380420007743, "request_id": "fieVaZCoMtWbkdUPueCoyAM", "raw_response": null}
