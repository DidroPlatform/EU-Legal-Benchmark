The candidate answer explicitly addresses this in the section 'Third Country Goods (Your China Example)'. It states that goods arriving directly from third countries (like China) are NOT covered by the Green Lane and are subject to full EU customs procedures, implying they are treated as entering the EU market and are not presumed safe for the UK internal market, which aligns with the concept that the reversed presumption does not apply to them, leaving them subject to the stricter, 'at risk' treatment (i.e., full EU controls/tariffs unless waived/reimbursed). The answer contrasts this with the Green Lane goods where the presumption is reversed.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2f0e047c-09d7-40ee-a04e-af21eca6630e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4157, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 4373}, "latency_s": 1.2169905839837156, "request_id": "-cSUacyMCtjpnsEPp8vxyAE", "raw_response": null}
