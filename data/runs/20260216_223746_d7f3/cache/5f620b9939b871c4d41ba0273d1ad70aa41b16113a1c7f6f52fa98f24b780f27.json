The candidate answer explicitly states: 'In the UK, you have moral rights, which include the right to be identified as the author of your work. The fact that the ad didn't credit you could be a violation of these rights.' While it does not explicitly name the 'Right of Paternity' or cite 's.77 CDPA 1988', it correctly identifies the *concept* of the right to be identified as the author, which is the essence of the Right of Paternity, in response to the user's complaint about not being credited. Given the context of a general advice response, this is sufficient identification of the relevant right.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ca200bce-50d9-4e30-b9ed-2460dccd0c78\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1000, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 1216}, "latency_s": 1.1541807079920545, "request_id": "xAyVaZOpFP6o28oPm8yLkQI", "raw_response": null}
