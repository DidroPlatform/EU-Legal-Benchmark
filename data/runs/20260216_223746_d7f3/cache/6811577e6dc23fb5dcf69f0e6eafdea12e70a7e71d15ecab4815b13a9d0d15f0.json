The candidate answer focuses almost entirely on provisions to be included in the Shareholders' Agreement (SHA) and does not explicitly state or advise that specific minority protection rights (like transfer restrictions or veto rights) *must* be in the Satzung (Articles of Association) to be enforceable against third parties or the company itself, which is a critical distinction in German corporate law (GmbHG). While it mentions statutory rights (§ 15 GmbHG) and suggests confirming pre-emptive rights in the SHA, it fails to address the enforceability requirement for the key negotiated terms (like ROFR, Tag-along, Vetoes) by explicitly stating which ones need to be in the Satzung versus those that can remain purely contractual in the SHA.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f462ad42-2453-401c-bc17-67772f6a802f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4252, "completion_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 4501}, "latency_s": 1.185333083034493, "request_id": "Q-yUaaDHBPCMkdUPpaWNwAE", "raw_response": null}
