The candidate answer discusses the necessity of force (Question 1: 'Did he honestly believe he was under attack/imminent attack?'), but it does not explicitly state that the defence *will fail* if the force was not used to avert such an attack. While the concept of 'imminent attack' is correctly identified as part of the subjective test for necessity, the response fails to deliver the specific negative assertion required by the criterion (i.e., that failure to meet this requirement leads to failure of the defence).\", \"criterion_id\": \"74ca3b09-c13e-4143-b0da-ede48e93caee\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2783, "completion_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 2968}, "latency_s": 1.4660680000088178, "request_id": "pMmUaafBDMeqnsEPypadgQU", "raw_response": null}
