The candidate answer explicitly addresses shared responsibility under the FSO 2005, noting the owner's role as the 'responsible person' and the tenant's role in causing the fire. Crucially, in the section 'Who Is Primarily to Blame?', it states: 'Legally, blame will likely be shared: Tenant: 60-70%... You: 30-40%... However, both parties had independent legal duties that were breached, so both can be fully prosecuted regardless of proportionate blame.' This directly supports the concept that liability is shared/apportioned between the owner and tenant due to shared control and failure to cooperate on safety obligations (e.g., coordination under Article 22 FSO 2005).\", \"criterion_id\": \"e230acad-079d-4755-a895-6b8e56fa4390\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2505, "completion_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 2747}, "latency_s": 0.8680784580064937, "request_id": "6M2UacO_JY3hnsEPj-nr0Q8", "raw_response": null}
