The conversion from a restaurant (public use) to a club facility (semi-private use) represents a material change in use that would require authorization. This statement appears **TRUE**.\n\n**Statement ii Analysis:**\nFritz wants to place four mobile glass cube sleeping rooms (15m² each) in pristine alpine nature outside building zones. He believes no building permit is needed because they are:\n- Mobile/removable\n- Only placed in summer months\n- Anchored with removable steel cables\n\nThe statement says his view that no building permit is needed is \"zutreffend\" (correct).\n\nUnder Swiss law (RPG Art. 22), construction outside building zones requires a permit and must meet strict requirements. These glass cubes:\n- Are clearly structures/buildings (Bauten)\n- Serve tourism/accommodation purposes\n- Are visible from afar\n- Are anchored to the ground\n- Have a commercial purpose\n\nEven temporary or mobile structures typically require permits, especially outside building zones. The fact they can be removed doesn't exempt them from permit requirements. Fritz's assumption is **FALSE** - he would need a permit.\n\nTherefore, statement ii is false.\n\n{\"answer\": \"C\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement i is true - the change of use from restaurant to club facility requires a permit. Statement ii is false - the mobile glass sleeping cubes outside building zones require a building permit despite being removable, as they constitute structures under Swiss planning law.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1148, "completion_tokens": 464, "total_tokens": 1612}, "latency_s": 11.960332833026769, "request_id": "chatcmpl-7f6c3f84-2374-44ea-891d-a8c64fc24bd2", "raw_response": null}
