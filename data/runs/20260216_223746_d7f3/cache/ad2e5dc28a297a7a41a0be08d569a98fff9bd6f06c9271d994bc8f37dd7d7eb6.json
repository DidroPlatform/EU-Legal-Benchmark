The candidate answer focuses heavily on the user being a 'squatter' or 'informal licensee' and discusses criminal squatting, adverse possession, and tenancy rights. While the user's status (which relates to occupation) is central, the specific legal term 'actual occupation' (which is typically used in the context of overriding interests in registered land law, often concerning beneficial interests in property, or sometimes in tenancy law to establish rights against a new purchaser) is not explicitly identified or discussed as the core legal principle governing the user's potential protection against the new owner. The user's situation is primarily about whether their informal arrangement survived the sale, which touches upon proprietary rights, but the model fails to name the specific concept requested by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d3fe8fdc-4186-4aac-aa48-c595472e7863\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1242, "completion_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 1463}, "latency_s": 0.8004744169884361, "request_id": "5iKVaZPfLfKcnsEPtfCWuQg", "raw_response": null}
