Specifically, it mentions 'Random and risk-based audits' and 'Per-employee or per-violation fines.' While it does not use the exact phrases 'algorithmic bias auditing' or 'mandatory salary band disclosure on job advertisements,' it strongly implies and supports these concepts through its discussion of audits of 'pay-setting systems' and the requirement for 'Worker access to meaningful comparisons: transparency about pay bands, leveling criteria, and promotion pathways.'
