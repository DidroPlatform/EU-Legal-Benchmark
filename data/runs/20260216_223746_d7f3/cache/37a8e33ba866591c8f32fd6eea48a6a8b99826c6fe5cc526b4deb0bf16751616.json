It follows the logical structure of admissibility decisions by: (1) identifying that serious legal questions exist requiring merits examination, (2) confirming no other admissibility grounds for rejection, and (3) declaring admissibility and proceeding to merits analysis. Options A, C, and D represent different procedural outcomes (manifest ill-foundedness, merits examination with preliminary objections joined, and admissibility with prior objections), but B most naturally extends a general admissibility argument excerpt with the standard formulation used in ECHR decisions.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 569, "completion_tokens": 154, "total_tokens": 723}, "latency_s": 2.5024848339962773, "request_id": "chatcmpl-eeb0f638-0355-4601-b4b3-0c1537b9ca96", "raw_response": null}
