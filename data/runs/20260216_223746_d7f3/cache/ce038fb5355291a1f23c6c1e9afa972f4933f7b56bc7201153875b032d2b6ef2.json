The Reinvermögenszugangstheorie defines income as the total increase in net wealth during a period plus consumption, whereas the description given (income that can be used without diminishing wealth) matches the Quellentheorie. Statement iv is false because it is not the ESTV (Federal Tax Administration) that specifies the principles of adequacy, collectivity, equal treatment, systematic planning, and the insurance principle - it is the BVV 2 / the Bundesrat (Federal Council) that does so. Statements i and iii are correct: i correctly describes Art. 24b FiG as adopted on May 15, 2022, and iii correctly states that cantons have a subsidiary general competence in tax matters.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 847, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 1063}, "latency_s": 5.312025584018556, "request_id": "chatcmpl-b59f29d2-decb-40b3-82f3-63ed56dee904", "raw_response": null}
