The candidate answer analyzes the drunk driver's liability and states that the intoxication is not an intervening act, but it fails to explicitly make the required comparison: that a *reasonable, sober* person would also have swerved to avoid the unexpected hazard (the chair). Instead, it focuses on the drunk driver's own impairment being part of their culpability, which is a different legal point regarding their own liability, not the required analysis of whether the swerve itself broke the chain of causation from the truck owner's negligence.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e6c03261-2d1c-42d6-bea6-ac11720c84cf\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1132, "completion_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 1325}, "latency_s": 1.1060796669917181, "request_id": "1OCUac2oAe-0xN8PyOCmuQ4", "raw_response": null}
