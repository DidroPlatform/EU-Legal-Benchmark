Specifically, Section 7, titled 'Checklist Before Signing the Compromesso,' explicitly lists items like verifying ownership (atto di propriet\\u00e0, visura catastale), checking for liens, confirming building compliance, reviewing condominium fees, and hiring a surveyor. Furthermore, Section 5 advises hiring a lawyer if the buyer is not fluent in Italian, which implies the need for an interpreter or legal assistance for documentation. This directly satisfies the requirement for providing a practical to-do list including IDs, bank account (implied by payment steps), codice fiscale (implied by tax/legal requirements), and interpreter (implied by language barrier advice).\", \"criterion_id\": \"a78a6819-17ac-4781-81b2-c45994bde72d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3029, "completion_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 3237}, "latency_s": 0.938902624999173, "request_id": "pvaUafOTIuKAkdUPiI2EmQs", "raw_response": null}
