The candidate answer discusses Section 44(2)(e) and Section 44(5) extensively, focusing on when the court *can* grant relief (i.e., when the tribunal cannot act effectively). It does not mention Section 44(6) at all, which deals with the court's power to revoke or vary an order previously made by the tribunal, or vice versa. Therefore, the specific requirement of the criterion is not met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3b951acb-152e-4be0-a915-e1528b4664a3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2273, "completion_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 2457}, "latency_s": 1.1880664589989465, "request_id": "db2UacDBIcKHnsEPkpLbwQ8", "raw_response": null}
