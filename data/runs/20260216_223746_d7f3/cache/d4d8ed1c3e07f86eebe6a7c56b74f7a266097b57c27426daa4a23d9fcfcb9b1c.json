The response explicitly addresses the liability of the French parent acting as the IOR, stating: 'A French-registered entity can technically be the IOR... But doing so means your French parent's balance sheet is directly exposed to HMRC enforcement...'. Furthermore, under Option B, the response advises using a third-party IOR to avoid the French parent being the direct declarant to HMRC, which achieves the goal of insulating the French entity from direct liability as the declarant/importer, which is the practical implication of the French entity acting as the EU Exporter/IOR in this context. The response clearly advises against the French entity taking on the IOR role directly due to liability exposure, satisfying the intent of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"cf77364d-885c-4118-9665-e75f304c088a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4390, "completion_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 4617}, "latency_s": 1.23790433400427, "request_id": "yreUaYPnEvWinsEPtZuzkQE", "raw_response": null}
