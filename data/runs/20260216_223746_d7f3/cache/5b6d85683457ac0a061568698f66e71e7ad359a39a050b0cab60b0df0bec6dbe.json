The candidate answer addresses this under section 2A, stating: 'If you were living in the property at the time of the remortgage, or if there was any evidence (e.g., emails, texts, utility bills in your name) that the bank *should* have known about your interest, a court *might* rule that the bank had **constructive notice** of your beneficial interest.' This directly covers the concept that the bank's failure to inquire (leading to constructive notice) can bind them to an unregistered interest (the overriding interest).\", \"criterion_id\": \"94c14c26-3d41-4b09-abe3-a18f253ce007\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2703, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 2904}, "latency_s": 0.678892707976047, "request_id": "YvmUaZWNBryK7M8PiJiNuAM", "raw_response": null}
