The candidate answer discusses intervening acts and cites cases like *R v Jordan* (grossly negligent medical treatment) and *R v Latif* (outrageous importation plot) as examples where the chain is broken. It then applies this standard to D1, stating D1's swerve was \\\"unreasonable/extreme\\\" and \\\"grossly negligent/criminal\\\" (due to alcohol level). However, the response never explicitly defines the legal threshold for an intervening act to be considered 'unreasonable' as requiring 'at least grossly negligent (a serious and extreme lack of care)'. It uses the term 'grossly negligent' to describe D1's actions, but does not define the *standard* for an intervening act using that specific phrasing as required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"adfdd50d-89a6-4813-81a8-984a4534df8d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1710, "completion_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 1951}, "latency_s": 1.0494905420346186, "request_id": "TjGVabOhGM2pvdIP5cbXoAg", "raw_response": null}
