This mirrors standard ECHR practice of avoiding redundant analysis once a violation is found. Options B and D reject complaints as manifestly ill-founded, which would be premature without prior substantive examination. Option C merely declares admissibility without addressing the merits, which is incomplete for a reasoned judgment continuation.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 464, "completion_tokens": 148, "total_tokens": 612}, "latency_s": 2.1567736249999143, "request_id": "chatcmpl-d2e48bc4-62a8-4a2a-ada4-2c7674d68629", "raw_response": null}
