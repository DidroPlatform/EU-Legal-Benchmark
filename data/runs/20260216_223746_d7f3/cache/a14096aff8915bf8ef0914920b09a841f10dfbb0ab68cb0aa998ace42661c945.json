The candidate answer discusses the location of assets (Section 4, Table, and Conclusion), stating the court is 'more likely to grant relief' if assets are in the UK, and may refuse if they are abroad. It also mentions granting an injunction 'restricted to UK assets'. However, the primary focus of the answer is on the relationship between the court's power under s.44 AA 1996 (which can support foreign arbitration) and the need to avoid undermining the arbitration, rather than explicitly stating that the *jurisdiction* to grant the injunction is *limited* solely to assets connected to England. While asset location is a factor in *exercising* discretion, the response does not clearly state this as a jurisdictional limitation in the manner implied by the criterion's negative weighting.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1ecca6f8-3c08-4562-8fa2-0491fea32bb3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2779, "completion_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 3011}, "latency_s": 0.9060631250031292, "request_id": "YfqUafrwE_fo7M8PipSSoQk", "raw_response": null}
