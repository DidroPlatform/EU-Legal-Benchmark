The candidate answer discusses the burden of proof reversal (presumption of 'not at risk' under WF vs. 'at risk' under Protocol) and mentions that goods from third countries (China) are subject to UK duties unless for NI consumption, and that high-risk goods are diverted to the red lane. It also mentions that the green lane is for goods staying in NI/UK and the red lane for goods destined for Ireland/EU. However, it does not explicitly state or confirm that the specific enforcement difficulties related to *raw materials/intermediate products* that are processed in NI before potentially entering the EU market (a known complex area under the Protocol that the WF aimed to simplify but arguably left unresolved in certain aspects) have *not* been resolved by the WF or subsequent instruments. The answer focuses more on the general green/red lane split and the shift in the burden of proof for final destination, rather than confirming the persistence of the unresolved issue regarding intermediate processing.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4415a72c-e330-4316-a7cb-27df04119e0a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2718, "completion_tokens": 289, "total_tokens": 3007}, "latency_s": 1.378271333000157, "request_id": "wDOVacz1BOKAkdUPiI2EmQs", "raw_response": null}
