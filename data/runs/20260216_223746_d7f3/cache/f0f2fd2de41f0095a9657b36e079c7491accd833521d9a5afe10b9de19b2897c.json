The candidate answer addresses the 'at risk' definition under the Protocol (which the WF modifies) by stating: '1. They are **not subject to commercial processing in NI**, or 2. There is a genuine risk they will enter the EU'. This directly addresses the concept that goods *subject* to processing are generally *not* considered 'at risk' (or at least, the inverse is true: goods *not* subject to processing are at risk). While it doesn't explicitly state 'goods processed in NI to become parts of products subsequently imported to the EU,' the inclusion of 'commercial processing in NI' as a factor determining 'at risk' status satisfies the core concept required by the criterion, which contrasts processing with simple transit/resale.\", \"criterion_id\": \"fc71b680-fd6e-4d06-9a32-d540462c9927\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2982, "completion_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 3223}, "latency_s": 1.1798692080192268, "request_id": "LgGVabyZJpmG7M8PkeL4mAM", "raw_response": null}
