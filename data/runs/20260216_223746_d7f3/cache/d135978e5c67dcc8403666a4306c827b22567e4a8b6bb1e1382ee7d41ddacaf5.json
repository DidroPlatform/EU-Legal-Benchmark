Background**\n\nBelgian authorized officers observed that lines anchored in the sea were not marked in accordance with the Convention's requirements. Upon identifying and approaching a Spanish vessel in connection with this observation, the Belgian officers sought to obtain information from the vessel. The Spanish officers on board refused to cooperate. Belgium has reported the vessel and further argues that the refusal to cooperate constitutes an additional violation of Spain's obligations under the Convention.\n\n**II. The Marking Violation (Article 5 and Annex IV)**\n\nArticle 5 of the Convention requires that \"[n]ets, lines and other gear anchored in the sea and nets or lines which drift in the sea shall be marked in order to indicate their position and extent,\" in accordance with Annex IV. Annex IV, Rule 1 sets out detailed requirements for anchored gear, including the fitting of flag or radar reflector buoys by day and light buoys by night, sufficient to indicate position and extent.\n\nIf the review board finds that the unmarked lines anchored in the sea belonged to the Spanish vessel, this would constitute a clear breach of Article 5 and Annex IV, Rule 1. Under Article 8(1), each Contracting Party undertakes to take such measures as may be appropriate to implement and enforce the provisions of the Convention with respect to its vessels and gear. Spain would therefore bear responsibility for ensuring its vessel's compliance with these marking requirements.\n\nThe review board is likely to find a violation of Article 5 and Annex IV on this basis.\n\n**III. The Belgian Officers' Authority to Identify, Approach, and Seek Information**\n\nUnder Article 9(4), authorized officers are empowered to \"observe whether the provisions of the Convention are being carried out, enquire and report on infringements of the provisions of the Convention, [and] seek information in cases of damage.\" Under Article 9(5), if an authorized officer \"has reason to believe that a vessel of any Contracting Party is not complying with the provisions of the Convention, he may identify the vessel, seek to obtain the necessary information from the vessel and report.\"\n\nThe Belgian officers had reason to believe that a Convention violation was occurring—namely, the unmarked anchored lines—and were therefore fully within their authority to identify the Spanish vessel and seek to obtain the necessary information.\n\n**IV. The Refusal to Cooperate and Spain's Reservation**\n\nHowever, we must draw your attention to a critical distinction in the Convention's framework, and to Spain's reservation, which will significantly affect the review board's analysis of the cooperation issue.\n\nArticle 9(5) grants authorized officers a graduated set of powers: (a) identifying the vessel and seeking information, (b) ordering the vessel to stop, and (c) boarding the vessel for enquiry and report. The power to identify and seek information is a baseline authority available under Article 9(5) generally. The more intrusive powers—ordering a vessel to stop and boarding—are addressed in the second sentence of Article 9(5) and in Article 9(6).\n\nSpain, upon signature and ratification, made a reservation under Article 14(3) to **paragraphs (5) and (6) of Article 9**, \"applicable to all Contracting Parties and signatory Governments, as also to those Governments which shall in future accede to the Convention.\" Spain further clarified upon ratification that \"Article 9, paragraphs 5 and 6, shall be binding on the Spanish Government only in respect of Contracting Parties which have not made to that end the reservation provided for in article 14, paragraph 3.\"\n\nBelgium did not make a reciprocal reservation to paragraphs (5) and (6) of Article 9 with respect to Spain. However, Spain's own reservation means that **Spain does not consider itself bound by paragraphs (5) and (6) of Article 9 vis-à-vis Belgium** (since Spain's reservation applies to all Contracting Parties).\n\nThis reservation is significant. Because Spain has validly reserved against paragraphs (5) and (6) of Article 9 with respect to all Contracting Parties, Spain is not obligated under those paragraphs to submit to the identification, information-seeking, stop, and boarding powers of Belgian authorized officers. The Spanish vessel's refusal to cooperate with the Belgian officers' requests under Article 9(5) would therefore fall within the scope of Spain's reservation.\n\n**V. Article 9(10) — Resistance as Resistance to the Flag State**\n\nBelgium has argued that the refusal to cooperate constitutes a further violation. Article 9(10) provides that \"[r]esistance by a vessel to the directions of an authorised officer shall be deemed as resistance to the authority of the flag State of that vessel.\" Belgium may contend that the Spanish vessel's non-cooperation amounts to \"resistance\" under this provision, which would be deemed resistance to Spain's own authority.\n\nHowever, Article 9(10) presupposes that the authorized officer is lawfully exercising powers that are binding on the vessel in question. Given Spain's reservation to Article 9(5) and (6), the Belgian authorized officers' directions under those paragraphs are not binding on Spanish vessels. Where the underlying authority to give directions does not apply due to a valid reservation, resistance to those directions cannot be characterized as a Convention violation. The review board is likely to find that Article 9(10) does not create an independent obligation separate from the paragraphs to which Spain has reserved.\n\n**VI. The Underlying Marking Obligation Remains**\n\nIt is important to emphasize that Spain's reservation to Article 9(5) and (6) relates only to the **enforcement and inspection mechanism**—it does not exempt Spain from the substantive obligations of the Convention. Spain remains fully bound by Article 5 (marking of gear), Annex IV (detailed marking requirements), and Article 8(1) (the obligation to implement and enforce the Convention with respect to its own vessels and gear).\n\nThe review board will therefore likely still find that Spain has an obligation under Article 8(1) to investigate the underlying marking violation and to take appropriate measures with respect to its vessel.\n\n**VII. Article 9(11) — Obligation to Consider Reports**\n\nUnder Article 9(11), \"[t]he Contracting Parties shall consider and act on reports of foreign authorised officers under these arrangements on the same basis as reports of national officers.\" Even though Spain has reserved against paragraphs (5) and (6), Article 9(11) creates an independent obligation to consider and act upon reports received. The review board may note that Spain is obligated to take the Belgian officers' report seriously and to investigate the matter, even if the Belgian officers could not compel cooperation at sea.\n\n**VIII. Likely Decision of the Review Board**\n\nIn summary, the review board is likely to decide as follows:\n\n1. **On the marking violation:** The review board will likely find that if the unmarked anchored lines belonged to the Spanish vessel, this constitutes a violation of Article 5 and Annex IV, Rule 1 of the Convention. Spain, under Article 8(1), bears the obligation to take appropriate measures to implement and enforce these provisions with respect to its vessels.\n\n2. **On the refusal to cooperate:** The review board is likely to find that Spain's reservation to paragraphs (5) and (6) of Article 9—which was validly made under Article 14(3) and applies to all Contracting Parties including Belgium—means that the Spanish vessel was **not obligated** under those paragraphs to submit to the Belgian authorized officers' identification, information-seeking, or boarding powers. Consequently, the refusal to cooperate does **not** constitute an additional violation of Spain's obligations under the Convention. The Belgian argument that the refusal to cooperate is a separate breach will likely fail.\n\n3. **On Article 9(10):** The review board will likely determine that because Spain has reserved against the paragraphs granting Belgian officers the authority to direct Spanish vessels, the \"resistance\" provision of Article 9(10) cannot be invoked to create an obligation where the underlying authority does not bind Spain.\n\n4. **On Spain's continuing obligations:** Notwithstanding the above, the review board may emphasize that Spain remains obligated under Article 9(11) to consider and act on the Belgian officers' report on the same basis as reports of its own national officers, and under Article 8(1) to take appropriate enforcement measures regarding the marking violation.\n\n**IX. Recommendation**\n\nWe advise Spain to take the following steps:\n\n- Investigate the reported marking violation through its own competent authorities and take appropriate enforcement action against the vessel if the violation is confirmed, consistent with Article 8(1).\n- Respond to Belgium's report in accordance with Article 9(11), demonstrating that Spain takes its Convention obligations seriously.\n- While Spain's reservation provides a valid legal defense against the cooperation charge, Spain should be mindful that persistent non-cooperation by its vessels may prompt other Contracting Parties to seek amendments to the Convention or to pursue dispute resolution under Article 13.\n\nWe remain at your disposal for any further questions.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Legal Advisory Office]", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 13449, "completion_tokens": 2135, "total_tokens": 15584}, "latency_s": 44.79836845799582, "request_id": "chatcmpl-eb59b451-5ce6-45eb-8173-9b604ab22c60", "raw_response": null}
