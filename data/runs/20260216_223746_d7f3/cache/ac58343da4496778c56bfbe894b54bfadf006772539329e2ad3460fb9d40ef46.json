More importantly, the scenario involves multiple *causal* actors (the truck driver, the drunk driver B, and the victim C), but the analysis focuses almost exclusively on B's liability, not on the concept of shared liability (contributory negligence) among the actors as a general principle.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ffc688ef-22ba-407e-bdc3-16550e83ea45\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3178, "completion_tokens": 252, "total_tokens": 3430}, "latency_s": 1.6775739999720827, "request_id": "oO-UabfCJtqI7M8Plt3AoAM", "raw_response": null}
