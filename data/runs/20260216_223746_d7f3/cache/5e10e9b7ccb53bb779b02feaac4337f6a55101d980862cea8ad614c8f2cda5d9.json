{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"score\": 0.95, \"pass\": true, \"rationale\": \"The candidate answer directly addresses the prompt by taking a clear stance (disagreement) and providing extensive justification rooted in legal concepts, which aligns perfectly with the reference answer's requirements. The reference answer mandates discussing shareholder wealth maximization vs. broader social responsibilities (CSR), mentioning specific legal theories, and citing relevant concepts/cases (though the candidate correctly substitutes Swiss law for the implied US/UK context, focusing on relevant Swiss statutes like OR articles and the Responsible Business Initiative debate, which maps well onto the required discussion points).\\n\\nSpecifically, the candidate covers:\\n1. Shareholder wealth maximization argument (Section II).\\n2. Broader social responsibilities/CSR (Section III).\\n3. Mentioning stakeholder obligations (Art. 717 OR interpretation, Art. 964a ff. OR, employee rights).\\n4. Discussing the purpose of corporate law/company operations (Conclusion).\\n\\nWhile the candidate does not cite the specific New Jersey Supreme Court case or Parkinson's/Dine's specific theories (which are marked as 'extra credit' in the reference), the depth of analysis regarding Swiss corporate law (OR, ESG, new reporting duties) provides a robust, legally grounded answer that fulfills the core requirements of the task context. The structure is logical and the conclusion is strong.\", \"criteria\": {\"overall\": 0.95}}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2199, "completion_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 2500}, "latency_s": 1.9834544579789508, "request_id": "vMaUacQE_eiewQ_dwKfJAw", "raw_response": null}
