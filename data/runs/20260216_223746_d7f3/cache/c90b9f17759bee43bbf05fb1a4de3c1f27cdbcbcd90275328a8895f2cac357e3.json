The candidate answer explicitly argues the opposite: \\\"The existence of an injunction against the arbitration proceedings may not necessarily affect the tribunal's jurisdiction. The tribunal's jurisdiction is derived from the arbitration agreement between the parties. If the tribunal has determined that it has jurisdiction, courts may defer to this determination.\\\" Since the response does *not* assert that the injunction automatically invalidates the award, it fails to meet the condition described in the criterion (which is phrased as a negative condition to check for). Therefore, the response is compliant with the expected behavior for this negative criterion (i.e., it does not make the prohibited assertion).\", \"criterion_id\": \"de5ab140-8126-4615-aadf-578d40e44047\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 993, "completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 1195}, "latency_s": 1.3986902079777792, "request_id": "sQqVafLFH_T1xs0PlO7m0AQ", "raw_response": null}
