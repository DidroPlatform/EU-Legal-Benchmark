The response mentions 'Canadian product standards,' 'labelling in English AND French,' 'product safety standards,' and 'Sanctions and export controls' under Section 6 (Regulatory and Compliance). It also mentions the UK-Canada Trade Continuity Agreement (CETA rollover) under Section 11 (Customs, Duties, and Trade Agreements). However, it does not explicitly discuss Canadian *competition law* (e.g., the Competition Act, prohibitions on vertical restraints like price maintenance or refusal to deal, or how exclusivity might be viewed under those laws) or the specific impact of *import regulations* beyond general compliance and tariffs. Therefore, the explanation of the required legal aspects is missing or too vague.\", \"criterion_id\": \"722d356d-883a-4a6f-90eb-737bbcf869e7\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1842, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 2056}, "latency_s": 1.1210661669902038, "request_id": "3UiUacGDOpzSvdIPmLSLwQs", "raw_response": null}
