The candidate answer discusses procedural fragmentation, including the difference between UK disclosure (CPR Part 31), German limited disclosure (ZPO \\u00a7\\u00a7 299-307), and extensive US e-discovery (FRCP). It mentions data privacy coordination (GDPR/BDSG-new) but does not explicitly state that the *enforceability of US discovery orders in the EU* is a key uncertainty or risk in coordination. While the differences in discovery regimes are noted, the specific legal uncertainty regarding the extraterritorial enforcement of US discovery mandates (e.g., under the Hague Evidence Convention or lack thereof) is not highlighted as the required key uncertainty.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3e986a45-fd40-4d19-9122-1432a8a5e47d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4394, "completion_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 4622}, "latency_s": 1.2078837499720976, "request_id": "XeiUaafjDOjd28oPzYGewAE", "raw_response": null}
