The candidate answer addresses this under the 'Green Lane' section for goods from third countries (China example): 'UNLESS the importer is in the Trusted Trader scheme AND can demonstrate goods are for NI final consumption only. Then: Green lane, but still subject to SPS checks if applicable.' While it mentions SPS checks, the core implication of the Green Lane is that the goods avoid the EU tariff and are subject to UK rules, which aligns with the spirit of the criterion regarding the UK tariff rate applying when intent to remain in NI is proven.\", \"criterion_id\": \"31ba07bc-6e8b-4a21-b24c-b747c1641530\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1981, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 2182}, "latency_s": 0.8143680420180317, "request_id": "59OUaYCGDpz07M8PqPy4oQI", "raw_response": null}
