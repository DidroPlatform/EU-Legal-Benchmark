Specifically, in section 1(e), it states: 'The contract can be used to allocate duties between you and the neighbour, but it does not relieve the RP of statutory duties.' In section 2, it notes that 'Lease clauses allocating fire-safety duties' provide 'contractual backup for enforcement' but cautions that 'A lease cannot override the statutory duty of the RP.' This directly addresses the criterion regarding explaining that a commercial lease can assign fire-safety responsibilities to the tenant.\", \"criterion_id\": \"938b8ea8-338e-4b84-90ec-be0a7edc224e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4324, "completion_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 4501}, "latency_s": 0.9096133330021985, "request_id": "p-uUacn6Ob-NkdUPkILV0AM", "raw_response": null}
