After the checklist you’ll find a **plain‑English guide** to each point, why it matters, and practical tips for a UK‑to‑Canada distribution deal.\n\n| # | Clause / Issue | ✅ Yes / No | Comments / Notes |\n|---|----------------|------------|------------------|\n| 1 | Parties & Definitions | | Full legal names, registered addresses, and clear definitions of “Products”, “Territory”, “Channel”, “Confidential Information”, etc. |\n| 2 | Grant of Distribution Rights | | Exclusive vs. non‑exclusive; exact Canadian provinces/territories; any channel restrictions (retail, e‑commerce, OEM). |\n| 3 | Territory & Language Requirements | | Must cover English‑ and French‑language obligations (Quebec). |\n| 4 | Performance Targets / Minimum Purchases | | Quarterly/annual volume commitments, sales forecasts, and consequences of missing them. |\n| 5 | Pricing & Payment Terms | | Currency (CAD or GBP), invoicing schedule, payment method, early‑payment discounts, interest on late payments, and who bears bank fees. |\n| 6 | Incoterms & Delivery Responsibilities | | E.g., DAP (Delivered at Place) or DDP (Delivered Duty Paid). Who handles customs clearance, duties, GST/HST? |\n| 7 | Import & Regulatory Compliance | | Distributor must obtain all licences, safety certifications, bilingual labeling, and product‑specific approvals (Health Canada, CSA, etc.). |\n| 8 | Product Liability & Insurance | | Minimum product‑liability coverage (e.g., CAD 10 M), cargo insurance, proof of insurance, indemnity provisions. |\n| 9 | Warranty & After‑Sales Service | | Who provides warranty service, repair, returns, and how costs are allocated. |\n|10 | Intellectual Property (IP) Protection | | Trademark/patent registration in Canada, licence scope, IP ownership, anti‑counterfeit measures. |\n|11 | Marketing & Branding Obligations | | Distributor’s marketing budget, brand guidelines, required approvals for advertising, co‑op funds. |\n|12 | Pricing Control / MAP / Resale Price Maintenance | | What you can (or cannot) dictate under Canadian Competition Act and UK competition law. |\n|13 | Confidentiality & Non‑Disclosure | | Duration (usually 3‑5 years) and scope of confidential information. |\n|14 | Non‑Compete / Non‑Solicitation | | Reasonable duration and geographic scope (must be enforceable under Canadian law). |\n|15 | Audit Rights | | Right to audit distributor’s books to verify sales, royalties, or compliance. |\n|16 | Term & Renewal | | Initial term (e.g., 2‑3 years), automatic renewal triggers, notice periods. |\n|17 | Termination Rights | | For cause (material breach, insolvency, IP infringement) and for convenience (with notice, possibly a break‑fee). |\n|18 | Post‑Termination Obligations | | Stock clearance, return of IP, de‑branding, outstanding payments, transition assistance. |\n|19 | Governing Law & Dispute Resolution | | Choice of law (UK or Canada), jurisdiction, arbitration venue (e.g., ICC in London, or CIETAC in Toronto), language. |\n|20 | Force Majeure | | Definition, notice requirements, and effect on obligations. |\n|21 | Export Controls & Sanctions | | UK export licences, EU/UK sanctions, and distributor’s compliance with Canadian import controls. |\n|22 | Miscellaneous (Notices, Assignment, Entire Agreement, Severability) | | Standard boiler‑plate but still important. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Why Each Clause Matters – Plain‑English Guide\n\n### 1. Parties & Definitions\n- **What:** Full legal names (e.g., “ABC Ltd., a company incorporated in England and Wales, company number 12345678, whose registered office is …”) and clear definitions.\n- **Why:** Prevents ambiguity. In Canada, a “company” can be a corporation, partnership, or sole‑prop. Make sure you’re dealing with a **registered legal entity**, not just a “trading name”.\n\n### 2. Grant of Distribution Rights\n- **Exclusive vs. Non‑Exclusive:**  \n  - *Exclusive* gives the distributor sole rights in the territory, but you must usually give them a **minimum purchase commitment** and **performance metrics**.  \n  - *Non‑exclusive* lets you appoint other distributors or sell directly (e‑commerce, Amazon, etc.).\n- **Territory:** Spell out provinces/territories (e.g., “the Province of Ontario and the Province of Quebec”). Canada is a federation; each province can have its own labeling, language, and consumer‑protection rules.\n\n### 3. Territory & Language Requirements\n- **Bilingual labeling:** Quebec law (the *Charte de la langue française*) requires French on all consumer‑facing packaging, instructions, safety data sheets, and marketing.  \n- **Advertising:** French‑language ads are mandatory in Quebec; English is acceptable elsewhere but you may still need French for national campaigns.\n\n### 4. Performance Targets / Minimum Purchases\n- **Why:** Protects you from a “dead‑weight” distributor who never moves product.  \n- **Typical structure:**  \n  - **Annual minimum purchase** (e.g., CAD 500 k)  \n  - **Quarterly forecasts** that the distributor must submit and meet (±10 %).  \n  - **Remedies:** Right to terminate, or to convert to a non‑exclusive arrangement if targets aren’t met.\n\n### 5. Pricing & Payment Terms\n- **Currency:** Most UK exporters prefer to invoice in **GBP** to avoid exchange‑rate risk, but Canadian distributors often want CAD. Decide early and include a **currency‑conversion clause** (e.g., “GBP amount = CAD amount on the day of invoice at the Bank of England rate”).  \n- **Payment method:** Wire transfer (SWIFT), credit card, or a **Letter of Credit (LC)** for first shipments.  \n- **Late‑payment interest:** Canada’s **Bank of Canada rate + 2 %** is common.  \n- **Bank fees:** Usually borne by the payer, but specify who pays SWIFT fees, conversion fees, etc.\n\n### 6. Incoterms & Delivery Responsibilities\n- **Incoterms 2020** are the global standard. Two common choices for a distributor‑only model:  \n\n| Incoterm | Who handles customs clearance? | Who pays duties & taxes? | Typical use |\n|----------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| **DAP (Delivered at Place)** | Distributor | Distributor | You ship to the distributor’s warehouse; they clear customs. |\n| **DDP (Delivered Duty Paid)** | Supplier (you) | Supplier | You handle everything, then invoice the distributor for the product cost only. |\n\n- **Why it matters:** If you choose DDP, you must be comfortable dealing with **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)**, paying **GST/HST** (5‑15 % depending on province), and any provincial sales tax (PST).  \n\n### 7. Import & Regulatory Compliance\n| Product type | Key Canadian regulator(s) | Typical approvals |\n|--------------|---------------------------|-------------------|\n| Food & beverages | **Health Canada – CFIA** | Food licence, nutrition facts (bilingual) |\n| Medical devices | **Health Canada – Medical Devices Bureau** | Device licence (MDL) |\n| Electrical/electronic | **CSA Group, IEC** | CSA/UL certification, Energy‑Star |\n| Toys & children’s products | **Health Canada – Consumer Product Safety** | Safety standard (e.g., CPSIA‑equivalent) |\n| Chemicals | **Health Canada – PMRA** | Pest Control Product licence, SDS (bilingual) |\n\n- **Distributor’s duty:** Must obtain all licences, ensure product meets **Canadian Standards Association (CSA)** or **UL** certifications, and provide **bilingual (EN/FR) labeling** (ingredients, warnings, instructions).  \n- **Your duty:** Provide all technical files, test reports, and **English‑only** documentation that can be translated. Keep records for **5‑7 years** (Canadian record‑keeping rules).\n\n### 8. Product Liability & Insurance\n- **Minimum coverage:** Most Canadian distributors demand **CAD 10 million** (combined single limit) product‑liability insurance, plus **commercial general liability**.  \n- **Proof:** Require a **certificate of insurance** naming you (the manufacturer) as an **additional insured**.  \n- **Indemnity:** The distributor should **indemnify** you against claims arising from their negligence (e.g., improper storage, marketing mis‑representations).\n\n### 9. Warranty & After‑Sales Service\n- **Who handles warranty claims?**  \n  - **Manufacturer‑backed warranty** (you repair/replace).  \n  - **Distributor‑backed warranty** (they handle returns, you reimburse).  \n- **Cost allocation:** Clarify who pays for shipping, parts, labour.  \n- **Recall procedures:** Must be **jointly** documented. Canada has a **mandatory recall** regime; the distributor must notify **Health Canada** within 24 hours of a safety issue.\n\n### 10. Intellectual Property (IP) Protection\n- **Register trademarks & patents in Canada** (via the **Canadian Intellectual Property Office – CIPO**) before signing.  \n- **License:** Grant the distributor a **non‑transferable, non‑sublicensable licence** to use your marks only within the territory.  \n- **Anti‑counterfeit:** Include a clause requiring the distributor to **monitor** for counterfeit goods and to **report** any infringement to you promptly.\n\n### 11. Marketing & Branding Obligations\n- **Co‑op marketing fund:** You may allocate a percentage of sales (e.g., 2 % of net sales) for the distributor to spend on brand‑building activities.  \n- **Brand guidelines:** Provide a **brand manual** (logo usage, colour palette, tone).  \n- **Approval rights:** You should retain **pre‑approval** of all advertising, packaging, and promotional material (especially important for regulated products).\n\n### 12. Pricing Control / MAP / Resale Price Maintenance\n- **Canadian Competition Act** prohibits **price‑fixing** and **unreasonable resale price maintenance (RPM)**.  \n- **What you can do:**  \n  - Set **maximum resale price** (allowed if it’s a “price ceiling”).  \n  - Provide **recommended retail price (RRP)** or **minimum advertised price (MAP)**, but you cannot enforce it through penalties.  \n- **UK competition law** also applies to your conduct abroad, so avoid any “price‑fixing” language that could be illegal in either jurisdiction.\n\n### 13. Confidentiality & Non‑Disclosure\n- **Scope:** Business plans, pricing, customer lists, technical data.  \n- **Duration:** Typically **3‑5 years** after termination.  \n- **Survival:** Must survive termination of the agreement.\n\n### 14. Non‑Compete / Non‑Solicitation\n- **Reasonableness test (Canada):** Must be limited in **duration (≤2 years)**, **geography (the territory)**, and **activity (selling competing products)**.  \n- **Enforceability:** Quebec (civil law) is stricter; a non‑compete must be **reasonable and necessary** to protect a legitimate interest.\n\n### 15. Audit Rights\n- Gives you the ability to **audit the distributor’s sales records** to verify:  \n  - Minimum purchase compliance  \n  - Correct calculation of royalties or marketing funds  \n  - Proper handling of confidential information  \n\n### 16. Term & Renewal\n- **Typical initial term:** 2‑3 years (allows you to test the market).  \n- **Automatic renewal:** “Unless either party gives 90 days written notice of non‑renewal.”  \n- **Renewal criteria:** May require the distributor to meet a **performance threshold** to qualify for renewal.\n\n### 17. Termination Rights\n| Reason | Notice | Remedy |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| **Material breach** (e.g., non‑payment, IP infringement) | 30 days to cure | Immediate termination if not cured |\n| **Insolvency / bankruptcy** | Immediate | |\n| **Failure to meet minimum purchases** | 60‑90 days after notice | Right to terminate or convert to non‑exclusive |\n| **Convenience** | 6‑12 months (often with a **break‑fee** or **stock buy‑back**) | Allows you to exit if market conditions change |\n\n### 18. Post‑Termination Obligations\n- **Stock clearance:** Distributor may be required to **sell off existing inventory** at a discount or return it to you.  \n- **De‑branding:** Remove your trademarks from any marketing material.  \n- **Outstanding payments:** Must be settled within a set period (e.g., 30 days).  \n- **Transition assistance:** Provide training to a new distributor if you appoint one.\n\n### 19. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution\n- **Choice of law:** You can pick **English law** (common for UK exporters) **or** **Ontario law** (or the province where the distributor is based).  \n- **Arbitration:** Preferred for cross‑border deals—fast, confidential, enforceable under the **New York Convention**.  \n  - Example clause: “Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in London, England, in English.”  \n- **If you choose Canadian law:** Consider arbitration in **Toronto** (ICC or ADR Institute of Canada) to avoid the need for a UK court to enforce a Canadian judgment.\n\n### 20. Force Majeure\n- Include **pandemic, natural disaster, customs strikes, trade embargoes**.  \n- Require **prompt written notice** and a **reasonable period** to cure (e.g., 30 days).  \n\n### 21. Export Controls & Sanctions\n- **UK Export Control Order 2008** (post‑Brexit) may require an **export licence** for certain dual‑use goods.  \n- Verify that the distributor is **not on any UK, EU, or US sanctions list**.  \n- Include a clause obligating the distributor to **comply with all Canadian import controls** (e.g., CITES for wildlife products).\n\n### 22. Miscellaneous Boiler‑Plate\n- **Notices:** Email + registered mail, with specific addresses.  \n- **Assignment:** Distributor may not assign the agreement without your written consent (protects you from being forced to work with a third party).  \n- **Entire Agreement:** Confirms that the written contract supersedes all prior discussions.  \n- **Severability:** If one clause is invalid, the rest stays alive.  \n\n---\n\n## 2.  Practical Steps Before You Sign\n\n| Step | What to Do | Tools / Resources |\n|------|------------|-------------------|\n| **A. Due Diligence on the Distributor** | • Check corporate registration (Corporations Canada). <br>• Review credit reports (Dun & Bradstreet, Equifax Canada). <br>• Ask for references from other UK/EU manufacturers. <br>• Verify they have a **Canadian Importer Number (BIN)** and are GST/HST‑registered. | • Companies‑House (UK) for cross‑check <br>• CBSA Importer Database <br>• LinkedIn, industry forums |\n| **B. Verify Regulatory Fit** | • Obtain a copy of the product’s **technical file** and confirm it meets Canadian standards. <br>• If you’re selling food, cosmetics, medical devices, etc., request the distributor’s **licence numbers**. | • Health Canada website (product‑specific guidance) <br>• CSA Group certification lookup |\n| **C. Protect Your IP** | • Register trademarks/patents in Canada **before** the first shipment. <br>• Draft a **license‑back** clause that limits the distributor’s use of IP to the territory only. | • CIPO (Canadian Intellectual Property Office) <br>• World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Madrid System for trademarks |\n| **D. Draft / Review the Contract** | • Use a **template** (see below) as a starting point. <br>• Have a **UK solicitor** with international trade experience review it, and a **Canadian counsel** (Ontario or Quebec, depending on the distributor) to ensure local enforceability. | • Law firms: Pinsent Masons, Hogan Lovells, Borden Ladner Gervais (BLG) <br>• Online contract platforms (e.g., **Contractbook**, **Ironclad**) for version control |\n| **E. Arrange Payment & Finance** | • Decide on **payment method** (LC for first order, then net‑30/45). <br>• Consider **export credit insurance** (UK Export Finance – UKEF) to protect against non‑payment. | • UKEF Export Credit Insurance <br>• Bank’s trade finance desk |\n| **F. Logistics & Customs** | • Choose an **Incoterm** and confirm who will handle customs clearance. <br>• Obtain a **Customs Broker** (e.g., **Livingston International**, **Kuehne + Nagel**) to avoid delays. | • CBSA Importer Self‑Assessment (ISA) program <br>• Freight forwarder quotes |\n| **G.
