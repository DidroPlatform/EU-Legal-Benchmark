The candidate answer explicitly rejects simple cost-plus/routine service models if the UK retains the key value drivers, stating that such structures are exactly what HMRC challenges. Instead, the recommendation is a full 'substance migration' where Ireland becomes the real entrepreneur/principal, which is a much more fundamental change than the simple 'Contract R&D' or 'Service Hub' model implied by the criterion's description of a failing structure. Therefore, the response does not claim that a simple cost-plus model successfully shifts the profit; it argues that only substance migration works.\", \"criterion_id\": \"fba931fb-bff7-4680-a849-8a48d7ca08e3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1517, "completion_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 1721}, "latency_s": 0.8328521660296246, "request_id": "2ByVafbMLYDHnsEPq_XX6Qg", "raw_response": null}
