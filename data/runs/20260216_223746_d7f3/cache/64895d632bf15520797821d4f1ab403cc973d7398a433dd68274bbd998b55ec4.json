The candidate answer discusses the 'at risk' presumption for goods moving from GB to NI and third-country goods entering NI directly, but it does not specifically address the unresolved issue of enforcement difficulties related to raw materials or intermediate products that are processed in NI before potentially entering the EU. It mentions the EU can audit and challenge diversion, but fails to state that the specific problem of tracing processed goods remains unresolved, which is the core of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"4415a72c-e330-4316-a7cb-27df04119e0a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2986, "completion_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 3169}, "latency_s": 1.2493706669774838, "request_id": "MwGVaZKBJ5jknsEPxt7C0AU", "raw_response": null}
