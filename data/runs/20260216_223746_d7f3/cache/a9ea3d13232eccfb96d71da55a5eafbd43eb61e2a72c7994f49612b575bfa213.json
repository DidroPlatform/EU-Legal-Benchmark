The candidate answer extensively discusses whether the occupier is a 'tenant' or a 'licensee' based on exclusive possession and agreement, which directly addresses whether they have a 'right in the land' (a tenancy or license). However, the answer does not explicitly state the legal principle that *actual occupation* alone is insufficient without a *right in the land* (like a lease or license) to gain protection against a new owner, which is the core focus of this specific criterion. It focuses on *what* right they might have, rather than stating the prerequisite that a right must exist for occupation to matter against a purchaser.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8718243c-5ff0-4b5c-8761-fc13dc640746\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2030, "completion_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 2229}, "latency_s": 1.1643931660219096, "request_id": "z_SUaeu1MKfx7M8PiZPD-AQ", "raw_response": null}
