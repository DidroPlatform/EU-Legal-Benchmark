It follows a typical judicial reasoning pattern: after establishing a violation of a fundamental right (Article 8), the Court concludes it need not examine all technical requirements of that article, then delivers its final finding of violation. Options A, C, and D all reference prior findings or examine alternative articles, which would typically appear earlier in the judgment rather than as a natural conclusion. Option B's structure—declining to examine remaining requirements, then stating the violation finding—represents standard ECHR judgment conclusion logic.\"\n}\n```", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 388, "completion_tokens": 140, "total_tokens": 528}, "latency_s": 2.4295806250011083, "request_id": "chatcmpl-baad4b31-7e32-4d43-b7b5-e823b8531542", "raw_response": null}
