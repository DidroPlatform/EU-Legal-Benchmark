While the candidate's definition is generally correct, it omits the explicit mention of selling a 'pro rata portion,' which is the specific detail required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"32a99ce4-2e4a-42d1-bf72-6db07c939b16\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2659, "completion_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 2835}, "latency_s": 1.902224333025515, "request_id": "ed2UabXPB6H0xN8P39CegA8", "raw_response": null}
