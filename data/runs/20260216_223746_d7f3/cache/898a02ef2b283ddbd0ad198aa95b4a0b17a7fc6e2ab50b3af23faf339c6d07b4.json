The candidate answer mentions 'Connection to the UK' as a factor the court would consider, stating: 'If the foreign company has assets in the UK or if the contract has some connection to the UK, the court might be more inclined to issue the injunction.' This implies that the presence of assets in the UK is a factor supporting the injunction, which aligns with the idea that jurisdiction over the assets is relevant, but it does not explicitly state that the jurisdiction is *limited* to assets connected to England. In fact, English courts can grant worldwide freezing orders (Mareva injunctions) even against foreign companies, provided there is a good arguable case on the merits and a real risk of dissipation, and the English court is the appropriate forum. The response focuses on balancing jurisdiction with arbitration, not on limiting jurisdiction solely to UK assets. Therefore, the criterion is not clearly satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1ecca6f8-3c08-4562-8fa2-0491fea32bb3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 696, "completion_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 942}, "latency_s": 16.394442999968305, "request_id": "egqVaYmWIJnqkdUP57jkuQo", "raw_response": null}
