The candidate answer discusses the difficulty of a single entry due to differing HS codes and suggests splitting the shipment. In Section 4, under 'How to Substantiate a Single Origin Claim (If You Must)', it suggests obtaining a 'Combined Certificate of Origin' that lists both models, but it does not explicitly state that a 'Statement on Origin' must list each product's model number as required by the criterion. Instead, it focuses on the need for a single HS code and substantial transformation, which are reasons *against* a single entry, rather than the specific declaration requirement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"fb98e7e2-e997-4f81-b5c1-ab1ae0d00140\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4566, "completion_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 4760}, "latency_s": 0.9269727499922737, "request_id": "QumUacaXO7_ZvdIPscGFwA8", "raw_response": null}
