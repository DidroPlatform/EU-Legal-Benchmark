The candidate answer correctly identifies that the lender's charge is *not* automatically superior and argues for the priority of the constructive trust based on timing ('If your constructive trust interest arose *before* the lender's charge was registered, there is a strong argument that your interest has priority'). While the candidate answer correctly points out exceptions (notice, actual occupation, fraud making the charge voidable), it leans heavily on the idea that pre-existing equitable interest *should* have priority, which contradicts the ground truth that a registered charge *almost always* has priority unless specific exceptions (like overriding interests or setting aside the charge) apply. The candidate answer frames the priority argument around the timing of the equitable interest arising *before* the charge, which is the exact scenario where the ground truth suggests the registered charge *still* usually wins unless an exception applies. Therefore, the response fails to align with the ground truth that registered charges have strong priority.\", \"criterion_id\": \"efe892e8-3336-4d58-afc7-6400db760a08\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1856, "completion_tokens": 285, "total_tokens": 2141}, "latency_s": 2.155702250020113, "request_id": "jbiUaZalKsewnsEPm4ag0QM", "raw_response": null}
