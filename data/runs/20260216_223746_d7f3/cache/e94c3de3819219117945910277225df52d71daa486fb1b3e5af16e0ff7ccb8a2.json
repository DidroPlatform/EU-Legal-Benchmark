The jurists had varying opinions; some held the treasure belonged to the landowner. The statement's attribution to 'the opinion of Roman legal experts' as finding this 'most equitable solution' is misleading/incorrect. Statement ii is incorrect: Legal sociologists use empirical/descriptive methods to observe societal phenomena; they do not first prescribe normative ends. That would be normative legal science, not legal sociology. Statement iii is generally correct as a description of abstract vs. concrete judicial review in many systems (e.g., Swiss/European constitutional review). Statement iv is correct: In Swiss civil proceedings, the court may refuse evidence that is irrelevant (anticipatory evaluation of evidence / antizipierte Beweiswürdigung). Statement v is incorrect: The Act of Mediation of 1803 actually ended the Helvetic Republic (which was established in 1798) and replaced it with a new Swiss Confederation. Napoleon did not 'found' the Helvetic Republic with the Act of Mediation. Thus statements i, ii, and v are incorrect.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 324, "completion_tokens": 304, "total_tokens": 628}, "latency_s": 7.577015582995955, "request_id": "chatcmpl-8214885d-e8ad-436c-9239-d72b73a48faa", "raw_response": null}
