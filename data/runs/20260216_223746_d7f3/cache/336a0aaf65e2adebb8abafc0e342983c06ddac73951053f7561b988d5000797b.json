Distributors can be great partners, but issues like non-payment, poor performance, or IP theft are common. **Strongly recommend consulting a UK lawyer specializing in international trade and a Canadian trade advisor (e.g., via UK Export Finance or the Department for Business and Trade)** before signing. Here's what to watch:\n\n- **Distributor's Credibility**: Verify their track record. Ask for references, financials (credit check via Dun & Bradstreet or Equifax Canada), trading history, and proof of similar deals. Red flag: New or unproven company, or evasive about past partners.\n- **Exclusivity**: Is it exclusive (they're your only seller in Canada)? If yes, ensure minimum sales targets to avoid them \"warehousing\" rights without effort.\n- **Payment Risks**: New relationships = high default risk. Insist on secure methods like letters of credit (LCs) or advance payments initially.\n- **Currency & Forex**: Proposals in CAD? UK firms often face GBP weakness—fix exchange rates or use hedging.\n- **Post-Brexit Realities**: UK-Canada Trade Continuity Agreement (TCA) mirrors CETA, so low/no tariffs on most goods (check your HS code via gov.uk/trade-tariff). But rules of origin apply—prove UK manufacture to avoid duties.\n- **Regulatory Hurdles**: Canada has strict labeling (bilingual English/French), safety standards (e.g., Health Canada for food/cosmetics), and import rules. Ensure distributor handles customs clearance.\n- **Taxes & Duties**: No VAT on exports from UK, but Canadian GST/HST (5-15%) applies on sales there. Distributor should handle.\n- **Red Flags in Proposal**: Vague terms, pressure to sign fast, no minimum orders, or overly generous \"guarantees\" without reciprocity.\n\n### Essential Clauses to Definitely Include in the Contract\nUse a robust, lawyer-drafted agreement (not a simple template). Aim for UK governing law with neutral arbitration (e.g., LCIA in London). Key must-haves:\n\n1. **Parties, Territory, and Exclusivity**:\n   - Clear identification of both parties.\n   - Defined territory (e.g., all Canada or specific provinces).\n   - Exclusive/non-exclusive rights, with your right to sell directly online or via others.\n\n2. **Products and IP Protection**:\n   - Detailed product specs, serial numbers, or schedules.\n   - License for trademarks/patents (non-transferable, revocable).\n   - Anti-counterfeiting: Distributor must report fakes; you get audit rights.\n   - No parallel imports from third countries.\n\n3. **Pricing, Payment, and Orders**:\n   - Fixed prices in GBP (or CAD with forex clause), with escalation for inflation.\n   - Secure terms: 30% advance, LC for balance, net 30 days max.\n   - Minimum annual purchase volumes (e.g., escalating yearly).\n   - Audit rights: Inspect their books twice yearly.\n\n4. **Delivery and Logistics (Incoterms)**:\n   - Use EXW or FCA (your UK warehouse) initially—you control export.\n   - Distributor handles Canadian import/customs.\n   - Clear title transfer and risk of loss.\n\n5. **Performance Obligations**:\n   - Sales targets/forecasts with penalties for missing (e.g., lose exclusivity).\n   - Marketing spend/commitments (e.g., X% of sales on ads).\n   - Reporting: Monthly sales data, inventory levels.\n\n6. **Term, Renewal, and Termination**:\n   - Initial 1-2 year term, auto-renew if targets met.\n   - Termination rights: For breach (e.g., non-payment >30 days), insolvency, or force majeure.\n   - 90-day notice post-term; sell-off existing stock only.\n\n7. **Warranties, Liability, and Insurance**:\n   - Your product warranties (limited to UK standards).\n   - Cap your liability (e.g., invoice value).\n   - Distributor insures goods in transit/stock; provide proof.\n\n8. **Confidentiality and Non-Compete**:\n   - Mutual NDA for 5+ years post-term.\n   - No competing products during term + 1 year after.\n\n9. **Governing Law, Disputes, and Compliance**:\n   - English law, exclusive jurisdiction in English courts (or ICC arbitration in London).\n   - Compliance with UK/Canada export controls, anti-bribery (UK Bribery Act), and modern slavery laws.\n   - Force majeure (e.g., strikes, pandemics—but not forex fluctuations).\n\n10. **Miscellaneous**:\n    - Entire agreement clause (no side deals).\n    - Severability (if one part invalid, rest stands).\n    - Notices in writing/email.\n\n### Next Steps and Resources\n- **Get Help**: Use UK gov's Export Academy (great.gov.uk), British Chambers of Commerce, or a solicitor via Law Society. For Canada, contact Trade Commissioner Service (international.gc.ca).\n- **Test Small**: Start with a short-term trial order before full contract.\n- **Costs**: Budget £2k-5k for legal review; consider export insurance via UK Export Finance.\n- **Sample Contracts**: ICC model distribution agreement as a base (iccwbo.org).\n\nThis covers 80% of pitfalls—tailor to your products (e.g., food needs extra regs). Proceed cautiously; a bad distributor can sink your expansion!
