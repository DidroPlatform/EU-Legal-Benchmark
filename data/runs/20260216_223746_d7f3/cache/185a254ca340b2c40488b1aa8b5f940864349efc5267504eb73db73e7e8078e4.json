{"provider": "google_genai", "model": "gemini-flash-lite-latest", "text": "{\"grade\": 0, \"reasoning\": \"The criterion requires the model to mention that the contract should include the tax payment terms and conditions. The candidate answer discusses taxes and duties in Section 5 ('Taxes & Duties') and Section 12 ('Canadian-Specific Considerations'), specifically mentioning who pays import duties, GST/HST, and the distributor's potential need to register for GST/HST. However, it does not explicitly state that the *tax payment terms and conditions* must be included in the contract as a specific contractual clause, although it covers the allocation of tax responsibility, which is closely related. Given the strict nature of the evaluation, the exact phrasing or clear inclusion of 'tax payment terms and conditions' as a required contractual element is missing, focusing instead on who is responsible for paying the various taxes.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b46b7cfb-5908-49f9-9de8-8741d5f6ff20\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2675, "completion_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 2882}, "latency_s": 3.1244013750110753, "request_id": "A_aUabSdKJzw7M8Pu9TR-AQ", "raw_response": null}
