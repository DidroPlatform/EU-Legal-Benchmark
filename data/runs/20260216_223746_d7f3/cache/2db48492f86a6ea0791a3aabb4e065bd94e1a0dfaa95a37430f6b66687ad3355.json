Acts adopted by the Federal Assembly can be challenged before the Federal Supreme Court, which might annul them in case they violate the constitution (constitutional review).**\n\nThis is **INCORRECT**. Switzerland has a unique system where federal laws (acts of the Federal Assembly) cannot be subject to constitutional review by the Federal Supreme Court. Article 190 of the Swiss Constitution requires courts to apply federal laws regardless of their constitutionality. This is a distinctive feature of Swiss constitutional law.\n\n**ii. Under the statutory marital property regime of participation in acquired property, by operation of law a spouse's individual property does not comprise inherited property.**\n\nThis is **INCORRECT**. Under Swiss law's participation in acquired property regime, inherited property IS part of a spouse's individual property (along with property owned before marriage and personal effects). The statement says it does NOT comprise inherited property, which is false.\n\n**iii. With the Helvetic Republic the pre-revolutionary confederate structure was restored.**\n\nThis is **INCORRECT**. The Helvetic Republic (1798-1803) actually replaced the confederate structure with a centralized unitary state under French influence. It was the Act of Mediation (1803) that partially restored the confederate structure.\n\n**iv. In 1866, Gustave Moynier wrote Das moderne Kriegsrecht (The Modern Law of War).**\n\nThis is **INCORRECT**. \"Das moderne Kriegsrecht\" was written by Johann Caspar Bluntschli, not Gustave Moynier. Moynier was a co-founder of the Red Cross but did not write this particular work.\n\n**v. If a party successfully concretely/indirectly challenges legislation, the administrative decision as well as the underlying legal provision are annulled.**\n\nThis is **INCORRECT**. In concrete/indirect review, only the administrative decision is annulled, not the underlying legal provision itself. The provision remains valid but is not applied in that specific case.\n\nAll five statements are incorrect.\n\n{\"answer\": \"H\", \"reasoning\": \"All five statements contain errors: i) Swiss federal laws cannot be subject to constitutional review; ii) inherited property IS individual property; iii) Helvetic Republic centralized rather than restored confederate structure; iv) Bluntschli, not Moynier, wrote that work; v) only the decision, not the provision, is annulled in concrete review.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 397, "completion_tokens": 535, "total_tokens": 932}, "latency_s": 7.979719416995067, "request_id": "chatcmpl-a0c321f3-1a8c-42c4-9363-be5aa8e1d99f", "raw_response": null}
