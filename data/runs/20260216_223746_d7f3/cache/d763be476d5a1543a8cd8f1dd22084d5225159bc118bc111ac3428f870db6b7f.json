The candidate explicitly proposes several mandatory enforcement mechanisms, including: 1. Mandatory Pay Audits & Corrective Action (citing Iceland's model where companies must prove pay equity via audits). 2. Financial Penalties for Non-Compliance (citing France's fine up to 1% of payroll). 3. Private Right of Action (allowing employees to sue). 4. Government Contracting Leverage (requiring proof of pay equity for federal contractors). These clearly satisfy the requirement for proposing mandatory enforcement mechanisms.\", \"criterion_id\": \"71239f09-3c08-4b68-ad2a-00016917f4aa\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2167, "completion_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 2347}, "latency_s": 0.8689010000089183, "request_id": "zwCVabuxEbW5kdUPzM_0sAM", "raw_response": null}
