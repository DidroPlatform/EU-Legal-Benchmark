The candidate response provides KPIs with targets (which act as thresholds) and immediate escalation triggers (which act as remediation triggers and timelines, e.g., \\\"Immediate escalation for any hold initiation >72 hours\\\"). However, it fails to explicitly define 'materiality thresholds/tolerances' separate from the KPI targets for most controls. For example, while it has a KPI target for 'False Positive Rate' (<5%), it does not explicitly state the materiality tolerance (e.g., 'Tolerance for False Positive Rate is 5%; anything above 7% triggers remediation protocol X within Y days'). The escalation triggers provided are often binary (e.g., 0 incidents, 100% compliance) rather than defining a tolerance band (e.g., 95% is acceptable, 90% triggers escalation). Since the explicit requirement for 'materiality thresholds/tolerances' alongside triggers is not clearly and consistently met across all control points, the criterion is not fully satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c81f11b1-1de7-4a08-9bea-c09bd530c8ac\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4024, "completion_tokens": 283, "total_tokens": 4307}, "latency_s": 1.2922697090252768, "request_id": "8tKUafWtKb3knsEP-_zhiQI", "raw_response": null}
