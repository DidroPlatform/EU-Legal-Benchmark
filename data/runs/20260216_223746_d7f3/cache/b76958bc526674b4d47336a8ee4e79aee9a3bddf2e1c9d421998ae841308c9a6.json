To avoid hidden costs and legal risks, you should thoroughly understand the steps, obligations, and potential pitfalls before signing the **preliminary contract (compromesso)**. Here’s what you need to know:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Key Steps Before Signing the Compromesso**\n#### **A. Due Diligence (Verifica Preliminare)**\nBefore committing, verify:\n- **Property Ownership (Visura Catastale & Atto di Proprietà)**\n  - Request a **visura catastale** (land registry extract) and the **atto di proprietà** (deed) to confirm the seller’s legal ownership.\n  - Check for **mortgages, liens, or encumbrances** (e.g., unpaid taxes, easements, or usufruct rights).\n  - Use a **notary (notaio)** or a **real estate lawyer (avvocato immobiliare)** to verify these documents.\n\n- **Urban Planning & Building Compliance (Conformità Urbanistica)**\n  - Ensure the property complies with local building codes (e.g., no illegal extensions).\n  - Request a **certificato di agibilità** (habitability certificate) for residential properties.\n  - Check the **piano regolatore** (zoning plan) for future developments that could affect value.\n\n- **Condominium Rules (If Applicable)**\n  - If buying an apartment, review the **condominium regulations** (regolamento di condominio) for fees, restrictions, or pending disputes.\n  - Ask for the **last 3 years of condominium meeting minutes** (verbali di assemblea) to check for issues.\n\n- **Tax & Debt Checks**\n  - Verify that **IMU (property tax), TARI (waste tax), and condominium fees** are up to date.\n  - Check for **unpaid utility bills** (electricity, water, gas) that may transfer to you.\n\n#### **B. Preliminary Contract (Compromesso) – What It Entails**\nThe **compromesso** is a legally binding agreement where:\n- You and the seller agree on **price, payment terms, and completion date**.\n- You typically pay a **deposit (caparra confirmatoria)**, usually **10-20% of the price**.\n  - If you back out, you **lose the deposit**.\n  - If the seller backs out, they must **pay double the deposit**.\n- The final deed (**rogito**) is signed later before a notary.\n\n**⚠️ Risks of the Compromesso:**\n- If the property has **hidden defects** (e.g., structural issues, illegal construction), you may still be bound to buy it.\n- If the seller **doesn’t have clear title**, you could lose your deposit.\n- If the **notary finds issues** (e.g., unpaid taxes, missing permits), the sale may collapse, and you may not get your deposit back.\n\n**✅ What to Include in the Compromesso:**\n- **Full property description** (cadastral details, boundaries, square meters).\n- **Price & payment schedule** (including any mortgage conditions).\n- **Completion deadline** (usually 3-6 months later).\n- **Conditions precedent (condizioni sospensive)** – e.g.,:\n  - Obtaining a mortgage.\n  - Clearance of any legal issues.\n  - Approval of building permits (if renovating).\n- **Penalties for breach** (e.g., if the seller pulls out).\n- **Clarification on who pays which costs** (notary, taxes, agent fees).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Hidden Costs to Watch For**\n| **Cost** | **Estimated Amount** | **Notes** |\n|----------|----------------------|-----------|\n| **Notary Fees (Onorario del Notaio)** | 1-2.5% of property value | Mandatory for the deed (rogito). Higher for complex transactions. |\n| **Registration Tax (Imposta di Registro)** | 2-9% | Depends on residency status and property type (primary vs. secondary home). |\n| **VAT (IVA)** | 4-22% | Only if buying from a developer (new builds). Resale properties are VAT-exempt. |\n| **Land Registry Tax (Imposta Ipotecaria & Catastale)** | €50-€200 each | Fixed fees for registering the deed. |\n| **Agent Fees (Provvigione)** | 3-5% (+VAT) | Usually split between buyer and seller (check contract). |\n| **Legal Fees (Avvocato)** | 1-2% | Recommended for due diligence. |\n| **Surveyor (Geometra) Fees** | €500-€2,000 | For structural checks, especially in rural areas. |\n| **Translation Costs** | €200-€1,000 | If documents are in Italian and you need certified translations. |\n| **Mortgage Fees (If Applicable)** | 1-3% of loan | Includes bank appraisal, notary, and registration. |\n| **Condominium Fees (Spese Condominiali)** | €50-€500/month | Varies by building (check arrears). |\n| **IMU (Property Tax)** | 0.4-1.06% of cadastral value | Higher for luxury/secondary homes. |\n| **TARI (Waste Tax)** | €100-€500/year | Depends on municipality. |\n| **Renovation Costs** | Varies | Many older Italian homes need updates (plumbing, electrical, heating). |\n\n**💡 Pro Tip:**\n- **Primary Residence (Prima Casa) Tax Benefits:**\n  - If you become a tax resident in Italy, you may qualify for **reduced registration tax (2% instead of 9%)** and **lower notary fees**.\n  - You must **not own another property in Italy** and **reside in the new home within 18 months**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Legal Risks & How to Avoid Them**\n#### **A. Seller Doesn’t Have Clear Title**\n- **Risk:** The seller may not legally own the property (e.g., inherited disputes, fraud).\n- **Solution:**\n  - Get a **certified copy of the deed (atto di proprietà)** from the **land registry (Agenzia delle Entrate)**.\n  - Check for **usufruct rights** (someone else may have the right to use the property).\n  - Verify **inheritance status** (if the seller inherited the property, ensure all heirs have signed off).\n\n#### **B. Illegal Construction or Missing Permits**\n- **Risk:** The property may have **unauthorized extensions, missing permits, or zoning violations**.\n- **Solution:**\n  - Request a **certificato di agibilità** (habitability certificate).\n  - Check **building permits (concessioni edilizie)** with the **municipality (comune)**.\n  - Hire a **surveyor (geometra)** to inspect the property.\n\n#### **C. Unpaid Taxes or Debts**\n- **Risk:** You may inherit **unpaid IMU, TARI, or condominium fees**.\n- **Solution:**\n  - Ask for **receipts of paid taxes** from the seller.\n  - Request a **certificate of no debts (nulla osta)** from the condominium (if applicable).\n\n#### **D. Fraudulent Agents or Sellers**\n- **Risk:** Some agents may **overcharge, misrepresent the property, or disappear with your deposit**.\n- **Solution:**\n  - **Only work with licensed agents (agenti immobiliari iscritti al REA)**.\n  - **Never pay a deposit without a written compromesso**.\n  - **Use an escrow account** (some notaries offer this) to hold funds until completion.\n\n#### **E. Currency & Payment Risks**\n- **Risk:** If you’re paying in a foreign currency, **exchange rate fluctuations** can increase costs.\n- **Solution:**\n  - Use a **currency specialist (e.g., Wise, Revolut, or a forex broker)** to lock in rates.\n  - Avoid paying large sums in cash (Italy has **anti-money laundering laws**).\n\n---\n\n### **4. The Final Deed (Rogito) – What Happens Next?**\n- The **notary** prepares the final deed (**atto pubblico**) and registers it with the **land registry**.\n- You **pay the remaining balance** (minus the deposit).\n- The notary **withholds taxes** (registration tax, VAT, etc.) and pays them to the government.\n- You receive the **keys and the deed** (now you’re the legal owner!).\n\n**⚠️ Important:**\n- The notary **does not guarantee the property’s condition**—only its legal status.\n- You must **register the deed within 20 days** to avoid penalties.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Should You Hire a Lawyer?**\n**✅ Yes, if:**\n- You’re **not fluent in Italian**.\n- The property is **old, rural, or has complex ownership history**.\n- You’re **buying through a company or trust**.\n- You want **tax optimization** (e.g., Golden Visa, residency planning).\n\n**❌ Maybe not if:**\n- The property is **new, from a reputable developer**, and you’ve done thorough checks.\n- You’re **buying with a mortgage** (the bank will do some due diligence).\n\n**💰 Cost:** ~1-2% of the property value (worth it for peace of mind).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Red Flags to Watch For**\n❌ **Seller refuses to provide documents** (deed, permits, tax receipts).\n❌ **Property is much cheaper than similar ones** (could be illegal or have hidden issues).\n❌ **Agent pressures you to sign quickly** (good deals don’t disappear overnight).\n❌ **No written compromesso** (never pay a deposit without a contract).\n❌ **Seller wants cash payments** (illegal for amounts over €3,000 in Italy).\n❌ **Property has no habitability certificate** (may not be legally livable).\n\n---\n\n### **7. Checklist Before Signing the Compromesso**\n✔ **Verify seller’s ownership** (atto di proprietà + visura catastale).\n✔ **Check for mortgages/liens** (visura ipotecaria).\n✔ **Confirm building compliance** (certificato di agibilità, permits).\n✔ **Review condominium rules & fees** (if applicable).\n✔ **Check for unpaid taxes** (IMU, TARI, condominium fees).\n✔ **Hire a surveyor** (for structural issues, especially in old/rural homes).\n✔ **Negotiate conditions precedent** (e.g., mortgage approval, legal clearance).\n✔ **Agree on who pays which costs** (notary, taxes, agent fees).\n✔ **Use a notary for the compromesso** (not just a handshake deal).\n✔ **Get everything in writing** (no verbal promises).\n\n---\n\n### **8. Final Advice**\n- **Take your time** – Don’t rush into a deal, even if the agent says it’s urgent.\n- **Visit the property multiple times** – Check for damp, cracks, noise, and neighborhood issues.\n- **Talk to neighbors** – They may reveal problems (e.g., flooding, noisy bars, bad condominium management).\n- **Consider a \"cooling-off\" clause** – Some compromessi allow a short period to back out if issues arise.\n- **Get a tax advisor** – If you’re a foreigner, understand **capital gains tax, inheritance tax, and residency implications**.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **Find a reputable real estate lawyer** (ask for recommendations from expat groups or your embassy).\n2. **Hire a notary** (they can also help with due diligence).\n3. **Get a surveyor’s report** (especially for older properties).\n4. **Negotiate the compromesso carefully** (include escape clauses).\n5. **Only sign when you’re 100% sure** – Once signed, backing out is costly.\n\nWould you like help finding a **trusted lawyer or notary** in a specific region of Italy?
