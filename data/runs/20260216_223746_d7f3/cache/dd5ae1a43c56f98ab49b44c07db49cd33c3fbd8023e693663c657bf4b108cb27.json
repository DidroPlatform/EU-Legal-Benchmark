The candidate answer proposes setting up a UK Import-Facilitator (a separate legal entity acting as the IOR) and using a customs broker under a limited Power of Attorney (PoA) and a 'Declaration-Only Services Agreement'. This structure is based on *Direct Representation* (where the UK entity is the IOR) or a variation thereof, not *Indirect Representation*. In indirect representation, the agent (the representative) acts in their own name but on behalf of the principal (the non-resident seller), making the agent jointly and severally liable for the debt. The candidate's proposed structure avoids this liability by making the UK entity the principal IOR, which is a direct representation model, thus failing to address the specific requirement of joint and several liability under an *indirect* representation agreement.\", \"criterion_id\": \"566fd9ff-4870-40ea-bad8-2cfc7888257d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4560, "completion_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 4798}, "latency_s": 1.0936917499639094, "request_id": "OemUaY7nB5iwxN8PlZ_qsQw", "raw_response": null}
