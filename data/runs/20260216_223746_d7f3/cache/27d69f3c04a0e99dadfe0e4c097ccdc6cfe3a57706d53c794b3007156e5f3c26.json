Driving alone = **driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence** (and often **no valid insurance**).\n\n### Arrest vs. what usually happens\n- **Arrest is possible but not typical** for this alone.\n- More commonly: you may get **points**, a **fine**, the car could be **seized**, and you could be reported for **no insurance** if your policy doesn’t cover you to drive unsupervised.\n\n### What to do right now (safest)\n- **Do not drive home alone.**\n- Ask your instructor to take you / do a paid drive home, or\n- Get a **qualified driver** to come and supervise you, or\n- Use **public transport/taxi** and collect the car later.\n\n### If you tell me these 3 things, I can give a more definite answer\n1) Where was your international licence issued (country)?  \n2) Are you **resident in the UK** (living here), and for how long?  \n3) Were you driving today on a **UK provisional**, and are L plates on the car / is there insurance for unsupervised driving?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 44, "completion_tokens": 370, "total_tokens": 414}, "latency_s": 8.056153374986025, "request_id": "gen_01KHNHZXD79QR0HCK0RZ2RHZXZ", "raw_response": null}
