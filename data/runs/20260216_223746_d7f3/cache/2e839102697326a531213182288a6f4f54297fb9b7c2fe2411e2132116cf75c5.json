The candidate answer discusses the legislative framework, duties, and liability but does not explicitly mention or detail the enforcement actions or sanctions available to the Enforcing Authority (EA) under the FSO, such as prohibition notices, alteration notices, or enforcement notices, which are typically found in Section 31 of the FSO (or referenced generally as sanctions). The reference to Section 7.10 in the criterion seems to be an internal reference point, but the core requirement is the mention of the prohibition notice as a sanction. This specific enforcement measure is entirely absent from the detailed analysis.\", \"criterion_id\": \"61747cb7-5391-47be-be91-aa0c1aaf6b6d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4443, "completion_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 4646}, "latency_s": 1.6864313330152072, "request_id": "Pr-UafW2HMKHnsEPkpLbwQ8", "raw_response": null}
