The candidate answer explicitly advises *against* the French parent company becoming the 'de-facto' IOR and instead proposes setting up a new UK entity ('UK import-facilitator') to act as the IOR. While the *newly created* UK entity can act as IOR, the response does not confirm that the *existing* UK retailer (the buyer) can or should act as the IOR, which is what the criterion asks about. In fact, the context implies the UK retailer is refusing this role, and the candidate solution bypasses confirming their ability to do so.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b95ec896-bf99-44a0-bde1-07de5ee914e5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4557, "completion_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 4748}, "latency_s": 1.4967942499788478, "request_id": "jumUab2uH4zLvdIPg8L54AI", "raw_response": null}
