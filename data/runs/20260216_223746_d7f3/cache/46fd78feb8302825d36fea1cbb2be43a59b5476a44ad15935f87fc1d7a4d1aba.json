Furthermore, Step 4, section A, explicitly mentions the requirement to send a 'Letter Before Action (LBA)' before suing, which is the formal step mandated by the Protocol.\", \"criterion_id\": \"7be1c4f0-9de0-4816-8887-142072b36ba8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4217, "completion_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 4416}, "latency_s": 1.111012916022446, "request_id": "LPiUadn9LceC7M8P_tvRkAs", "raw_response": null}
