The candidate answer discusses the drunk driver's actions as a potential *novus actus interveniens* for the truck driver, but it explicitly frames the argument around whether the drunk driver's conduct was 'independent' and 'unforeseeable/extraordinary' due to his intoxication and swerving into another car. It notes that a reaction to debris is generally foreseeable, but it does not assert the specific argument required by the criterion: that a *reasonable person* (even sober) would have swerved similarly. In fact, the analysis suggests the drunk driver's action (swerving into another car) might be considered abnormal or extreme, which runs contrary to the required argument.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e6c03261-2d1c-42d6-bea6-ac11720c84cf\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1792, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 2015}, "latency_s": 1.1217271250206977, "request_id": "hx6VadeGA_Dm7M8PqbvO6QU", "raw_response": null}
