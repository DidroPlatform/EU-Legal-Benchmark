The response discusses jurisdiction (consent, connection, applicable law) extensively, which is the primary gatekeeper for counterclaims in investment arbitration. However, it treats admissibility and jurisdiction as largely synonymous throughout the analysis, failing to explicitly draw the distinction required by the criterion. For instance, it frames the entire discussion around jurisdictional hurdles (consent, connection) without clarifying that a claim could pass these jurisdictional tests but still be deemed inadmissible on other grounds (e.g., procedural timing, lack of standing for the state to bring the claim, or failure to exhaust local remedies if required, although the latter is less common for counterclaims). The response focuses on *jurisdictional* tests, not the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5bd9c5b8-913d-4e37-8ca4-67a98f63820c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3015, "completion_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 3236}, "latency_s": 1.0668049579835497, "request_id": "jv2UaauaDfT77M8Prpvt6Ag", "raw_response": null}
