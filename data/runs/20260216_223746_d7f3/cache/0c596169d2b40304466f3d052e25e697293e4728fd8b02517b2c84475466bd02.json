The candidate answer discusses the need for assets in England or within reach of English orders (Section 3(c) and 4), which implies a connection to the jurisdiction is necessary for the injunction to be effective or upheld. However, the primary focus of the answer is on the court's power under s.44 AA 1996 to grant relief 'in support of' arbitration, which applies regardless of where the assets are, provided the respondent can be made subject to the order (Section 1, Key features). The answer states the injunction can be made against a foreign company if there is a sufficient connection and/or assets within the jurisdiction, but it does not explicitly state that the *jurisdiction* of the English Courts is *limited* solely to assets connected to England, especially since English courts can grant relief against assets outside England if the respondent is subject to the order (e.g., via English bank accounts or third parties). The answer focuses more on the *exercise* of discretion based on connections rather than a strict *limitation* of jurisdiction based on asset location.\", \"criterion_id\": \"1ecca6f8-3c08-4562-8fa2-0491fea32bb3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1641, "completion_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 1933}, "latency_s": 6.569602584000677, "request_id": "_hmVaejMNJjknsEPxt7C0AU", "raw_response": null}
