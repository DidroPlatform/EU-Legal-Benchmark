Once it is signed you (and the seller) are obliged to complete the transaction, and breaking it can cost you the deposit **and** a penalty.  \n>  \n> The safest way to protect yourself is to do a full “due‑diligence” before you even put pen to paper.\n\nBelow is a **step‑by‑step checklist** of the legal, fiscal and practical items you should verify, the typical hidden costs you will meet, and the red‑flags that can turn a dream home into a nightmare.\n\n---\n\n## 1️⃣  Preliminary Legal Due Diligence (Do this **before** the *compromesso*)\n\n| Item | Why it matters | How to verify / who to involve |\n|------|----------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Title & ownership** | Confirms the seller really owns the property and can sell it. | Request the *visura catastale* (cadastral sheet) and *visura ipotecaria* (land‑registry search) from the *Conservatoria dei Registri Immobiliari*. A qualified **Italian lawyer (avvocato)** or **notary** should read them. |\n| **Encumbrances & liens** | Mortgages, tax debts, utility charges, or a *pignoramento* (seizure) can follow the buyer. | Same land‑registry search; also ask for a *certificato di stato libero da ipoteche* (certificate of no mortgage). |\n| **Usufruct / servitudes / easements** | May limit how you can use the land (e.g., right of way, agricultural use, historic preservation). | Check the *visura catastale* and the *planimetria*; ask the seller for any *servitù* documents. |\n| **Building permits & conformity** | Illegal extensions, missing *SCIA* (communication of start of works) or *permesso di costruire* can lead to fines or demolition orders. | Ask for the *certificato di agibilità* (occupancy certificate) and any *permessi di costruire* filed at the *Comune*. A **technical surveyor (geometra/architetto)** can verify. |\n| **Energy Performance Certificate (APE)** | Mandatory for any sale; tells you the energy class and heating costs. | Must be supplied by the seller; check the rating. |\n| **Condominium status (if applicable)** | Ongoing maintenance fees, reserve fund contributions, pending works, or disputes with other owners. | Request the *verbali* of the last two *assemblee condominiali* and the *regolamento condominiale*. |\n| **Outstanding utility bills & taxes** | Water, gas, electricity, waste, and *IMU* (property tax) arrears can be transferred to you. | Ask for recent *bollette* and the *certificato di pagamento IMU* from the *Comune*. |\n| **Seismic zone & structural safety** | Italy has strict seismic classifications; older buildings may need costly retrofits. | The *APE* includes a seismic class; a structural engineer can assess. |\n| **Heritage / “Vincolo”** | If the property is in a protected historic zone, you may need special permits for any work. | Check with the *Soprintendenza* (cultural heritage office) or the *Comune*. |\n| **Foreign‑buyer restrictions** | Non‑EU citizens may need a *permesso di soggiorno* or a *cassa di deposito* (bank escrow) for large sums. | Verify your tax code (*codice fiscale*) and bank account; consult a **tax advisor**. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** *Never sign the compromesso until you have a clean title, no hidden debts, and all required permits in place.*  \n\n---\n\n## 2️⃣  What the *Compromesso* Actually Contains (Key Clauses)\n\n| Clause | What you should look for / negotiate |\n|--------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Identifying data** | Full names, *codice fiscale*, and exact property description (address, cadastral reference, plan). |\n| **Price & payment schedule** | Total price, deposit amount, dates of subsequent payments, and method (bank transfer, escrow). |\n| **Deposit (caparra confirmatoria)** | Usually 10 % of the price (or 5 % for a *caparra penitenziale*). Clarify whether it’s **confirmatory** (you lose it if you back out) or **penitential** (you can get it back, seller keeps half). |\n| **Escrow / fidejussione** | Consider using a **notary‑held escrow account** or a **bank guarantee** instead of a cash deposit. |\n| **Conditions precedent (condizioni sospensive)** | Common ones: buyer obtains mortgage, seller clears debts, building permits are valid, *certificato di agibilità* is delivered, buyer’s financing is approved. If any condition fails, the contract can be terminated without penalty. |\n| **Completion date (data del rogito)** | Usually 30‑90 days after signing. Make sure you have enough time to arrange a mortgage and any required permits. |\n| **Penalty clause (penale)** | Usually 10 % of the purchase price for the party that breaches. Verify the exact amount. |\n| **Transfer of risk** | Usually risk passes at *rogito*, but some contracts shift it earlier (e.g., after the *compromesso*). |\n| **Inventory & fixtures** | List of what stays (e.g., kitchen appliances, built‑in wardrobes). |\n| **Warranty for hidden defects (garanzia per vizi occulti)** | Italian law gives the buyer 2 years to claim hidden defects. The contract should reference this statutory warranty. |\n| **Governing law & jurisdiction** | Usually Italian law; if you are a foreign buyer, you may want a clause allowing arbitration in your home country. |\n| **Signature & witnesses** | Both parties sign; a *notaio* is not required for the *compromesso* but you may want one to witness it. |\n\n> **Tip:** Have a bilingual (Italian‑English) version of the contract, or at least a certified translation, so you fully understand every clause.\n\n---\n\n## 3️⃣  Hidden Costs You’ll Meet After the *Compromesso*\n\n| Cost | Approx. % of purchase price (or flat fee) | Who pays? | When due |\n|------|-------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| **Registration tax (imposta di registro)** | 2 % (first‑home *prima casa*) or 9 % (second home) of the declared price | Buyer | At *rogito* (notary) |\n| **Cadastral tax (imposta catastale)** | €50 (first home) or €100 (second home) | Buyer | At *rogito* |\n| **Mortgage tax (imposta ipotecaria)** | €50 (first home) or €200 (second home) | Buyer (if you take a mortgage) | At *rogito* |\n| **Notary fees** | 1‑2 % of purchase price (plus VAT) | Buyer (usually) | At *rogito* |\n| **Real estate agency commission** | 2‑3 % of price + VAT (often split 50/50 between buyer & seller) | Usually buyer, but can be negotiated | At *rogito* |\n| **Surveyor / technical inspection** | €300‑€1 500 (depends on size) | Buyer | Before *compromesso* |\n| **Legal fees (avvocato)** | €1 000‑€3 000 (flat or hourly) | Buyer | Before *compromesso* |\n| **Translation / certified copies** | €100‑€300 per document | Buyer | As needed |\n| **Utility connection fees** | €100‑€500 (water, gas, electricity) | Buyer | After *rogito* |\n| **Condominium reserve fund contribution** | Usually 1‑2 % of the purchase price (one‑off) | Buyer (if condo) | At *rogito* |\n| **Renovation / compliance works** | Highly variable (often 5‑20 % of price) | Buyer | After *rogito* |\n| **Annual property taxes** | IMU (if second home) – 0.4‑0.76 % of cadastral value; TASI (if applicable) | Buyer | Ongoing |\n| **Insurance (building & contents)** | €200‑€800 per year | Buyer | After *rogito* |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The “price you see” is only the tip of the iceberg. Budget **at least an extra 8‑12 %** of the purchase price for taxes, notary, agency and ancillary fees, plus a contingency fund for unexpected repairs.\n\n---\n\n## 4️⃣  Practical Checklist – “Do‑Before‑Signing” List\n\n| # | Action | Who does it? | Documents / Proof |\n|---|--------|--------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | Obtain your **Italian tax code (codice fiscale)** | You (through Italian consulate or a tax service) | Tax code certificate |\n| 2 | Open an **Italian bank account** (needed for escrow, notary fees) | You | Bank statement |\n| 3 | **Hire a bilingual lawyer** (or *avvocato* experienced in real estate) | You | Engagement letter |\n| 4 | Request **visura catastale** and **visura ipotecaria** (title search) | Lawyer / notary | Official extracts |\n| 5 | Verify **no pending mortgages or liens** | Lawyer | *Certificato di stato libero da ipoteche* |\n| 6 | Check **building permits, agibilità, APE** | Surveyor / architect | Copies of permits, APE |\n| 7 | Review **condominium documents** (if applicable) | Lawyer | Minutes of last 2 assemblies, reserve fund balance |\n| 8 | Order a **technical inspection** (structural, electrical, plumbing) | Surveyor | Inspection report |\n| 9 | Confirm **utility bills are paid up to date** | Seller / your lawyer | Recent bills, *certificato di pagamento* |\n|10| Negotiate **conditions precedent** (mortgage, clear title) into the *compromesso* | Lawyer & you | Draft contract |\n|11| Decide **deposit method** – cash vs escrow vs bank guarantee | You & seller | Bank escrow agreement |\n|12| Review **penalty clause** – ensure it’s not excessive (10 % is standard) | Lawyer | Contract clause |\n|13| Get **translation** of all key documents (if you don’t read Italian) | Certified translator | Translated copies |\n|14| Verify **foreign‑buyer tax regime** (e.g., *imposta di registro* for non‑EU) | Tax advisor | Tax calculation |\n|15| Sign the **pre‑sale contract** only after all above are satisfied | You & seller (witnessed) | Signed *compromesso* |\n\n---\n\n## 5️⃣  Common Pitfalls & Red Flags\n\n| Pitfall | Why it’s risky | How to avoid |\n|---------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Seller can’t produce a clean title** | You may inherit mortgages, tax debts, or even a *possesso* (occupancy) dispute. | Insist on a *certificato di libero da ipoteche*; make title clearance a condition precedent. |\n| **Missing *certificato di agibilità*** | The property may be illegal to occupy; you could be forced to regularize or face demolition. | Demand the certificate; if missing, ask the seller to obtain it before *rogito* or negotiate a price reduction. |\n| **Undisclosed condominium debts** | You inherit unpaid fees and may be sued by the condo. | Request the *verbale* of the last assembly and a *certificato di saldo* from the administrator. |\n| **Seismic non‑compliance** | Retrofitting can cost €1 000‑€2 000 per sqm. | Get a seismic classification from the *APE*; hire a structural engineer for an estimate. |\n| **Over‑valuation of the property** | You’ll pay higher registration tax and may over‑pay for a low‑quality asset. | Compare recent sales of similar properties in the same *zona*; ask for an independent appraisal. |\n| **Deposit (caparra) too high without escrow** | If the seller disappears you could lose the money. | Use a **notary‑held escrow** or a **bank guarantee** instead of handing cash directly. |\n| **No clause for mortgage approval** | If your loan is denied you’re stuck paying the penalty. | Insert a **mortgage‑contingency** clause (e.g., “contract void if buyer cannot obtain financing within 45 days”). |\n| **Seller is a company in liquidation** | The sale may be halted by the court. | Verify the seller’s *visura camerale* (company register) and that the liquidation is completed. |\n| **Unclear boundaries / “abandoned” land** | You may discover that part of the lot is public land or belongs to a neighbor. | Check the *planimetria catastale* and the *carta topografica* at the *Comune*. |\n| **Currency fluctuations (if paying in euros from abroad)** | A sudden euro rise can increase your effective cost. | Consider a **FX forward contract** or a multi‑currency bank account to lock the rate. |\n\n---\n\n## 6️⃣  After the *Compromesso* – What Happens Next?\n\n1. **Mortgage application** – If you need a loan, start it immediately. Lenders will request the *compromesso* and the title search.\n2. **Final due‑diligence** – The notary will double‑check the land‑registry extracts, verify that all taxes are paid, and prepare the *rogito* deed.\n3. **Escrow / deposit release** – The deposit is either held by the notary or returned if a condition precedent fails.\n4. **Signing the *rogito*** – This is the public deed signed before a notary. The notary reads the deed aloud, both parties sign, and the notary registers the transfer.\n5. **Payment of taxes & fees** – The notary collects registration tax, cadastral tax, mortgage tax, and his/her fee, then forwards them to the tax office.\n6. **Delivery of keys & inventory** – Usually at the same moment as the *rogito*; a *verbale di consegna* (hand‑over protocol) is signed.\n7. **Post‑sale registrations** – The notary updates the *catasto* (cadastral) and *registro immobiliare* (land registry). You will receive a copy of the deed (*atto di vendita*) and the updated *visura catastale*.\n\n---\n\n## 7️⃣  Quick “Cheat‑Sheet” for a First‑Time Foreign Buyer\n\n| Step | Timeline | Who’s Involved |\n|------|----------|----------------|\n| **Obtain codice fiscale** | 1‑2 weeks | Italian consulate / tax service |\n| **Open Italian bank account** | 1‑2 weeks | Bank |\n| **Hire bilingual lawyer & notary** | Immediately | Lawyer, notary |\n| **Property search & preliminary visit** | Ongoing | Real‑estate agent |\n| **Technical inspection & title search** | 2‑3 weeks | Surveyor, lawyer |\n| **Negotiate price & conditions** | 1‑2 weeks | Lawyer, agent |\n| **Sign *compromesso*** | After all checks | You, seller, lawyer (optional) |\n| **Deposit (escrow)** | Same day | Bank / notary |\n| **Apply for mortgage** | 2‑4 weeks | Bank |\n| **Finalize *rogito*** | 30‑90 days after *compromesso* | Notary, buyer, seller |\n| **Pay taxes & fees** | At *rogito* | Notary |\n| **Register & receive deed** | Within 1 month | Notary, land registry |\n| **Move‑in / start renovations** | After *rogito* | You |\n\n---\n\n## 8️⃣  Resources & Where to Get Help\n\n| Resource | What it offers | How to access |\n|----------|----------------|---------------|\n| **Agenzia delle Entrate – “Imposta di Registro” calculator** | Quick estimate of registration tax | <https://telematici.agenziaentrate.gov.it/> |\n| **Portale del Catasto** | Online cadastral extracts (visura) | Requires *codice fiscale* and a fee |\n| **Conservatoria dei Registri Immobiliari** | Land‑registry searches (mortgage, liens) | Via a *notaio* or online service (e.g., *VisuraOnline*) |\n| **Italian Bar Association (Consiglio Nazionale Forense)** | Find a qualified *avvocato* in any region | <https://www.consiglionazionaleforense.it/> |\n| **Notariato Italiano** | Directory of notaries,", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 102, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 4198}, "latency_s": 19.427578208007617, "request_id": "chatcmpl-775032a8-2871-439f-baee-d8315d90f574", "raw_response": null}
