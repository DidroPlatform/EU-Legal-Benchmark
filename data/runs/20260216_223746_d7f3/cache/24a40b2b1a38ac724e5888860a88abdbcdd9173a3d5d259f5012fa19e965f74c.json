Section 4.2, under 'Core duties,' explicitly mentions the duty to 'Maintain a transparent accounting' and details the requirement to keep a 'registro delle operazioni' and file an 'annual report' (*relazione annuale*) which includes a 'Balance sheet of assets at the beginning and end of the year.' Furthermore, Section 3, Document 8, mentions providing a 'Financial overview' (list of assets, bank accounts, properties, debts) as a useful document for the petition. While it doesn't cite the specific Civil Code article governing the *inventory* itself (which is often part of the initial decree or subsequent reporting duties under Art. 411 c.c.), it clearly references the procedural requirements (annual report, balance sheet) and the court's expectation regarding financial documentation, satisfying the spirit of referencing legal/procedural bases for asset accounting.\", \"criterion_id\": \"309c2405-ecd4-4a2c-a518-231740e71554\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4194, "completion_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 4450}, "latency_s": 1.2701663339976221, "request_id": "J-eUadbPDKaGxN8PueC3gQs", "raw_response": null}
