Statement ii is incorrect: Swiss res judicata is narrower than described—it binds only the specific parties and specific claims, not all findings of fact and legal assessments for subsequent disputes. Statement iii is incorrect: Swiss arbitral tribunals can make binding decisions on jurisdiction (Kompetenz-Kompetenz), but Swiss law does allow limited court scrutiny under specific circumstances. Statement iv is correct: legal sociology does recommend observing real legal problems from doctrinal perspectives and reintegrating findings. Statement v is correct: Swiss limited liability company law (GmbH) provides limited liability protection—shareholders' liability is limited to their capital contributions.
