Every structural trick to move profit away from where substance sits runs into the same wall:\n\n**Post-BEPS, post-Pillar Two, post-DPT**, the international framework has been specifically redesigned to prevent exactly this outcome. The UK's arsenal now includes:\n\n- **Transfer pricing rules** aligned to value creation\n- **Diverted Profits Tax** at 25% as a backstop\n- **GAAR** for anything artificial\n- **CFC rules** to tax Irish-held profits anyway if controlled from the UK\n- **Pillar Two** ensuring 15% minimum regardless\n\nAny structure shifting >50% of residual profit to Ireland **without genuinely moving the people, decisions, risk management, and key functions to Ireland** will fail. And if you do genuinely move all of that, you no longer have a UK business with an Irish structure — you have an Irish business, which is a different conversation entirely.\n\n---\n\n## What I Actually Recommend\n\n### The Real Conversation to Have With the Client\n\nReframe the engagement. The client is asking the wrong question. They're asking *\"how do I move profit to Ireland?\"* when they should be asking **\"how do I minimise my global effective tax rate legitimately?\"**\n\n### Concrete Steps That Actually Work\n\n**1. Genuine Functional Reallocation (12-24 months)**\n- Actually relocate specific business functions to Ireland — not brass plates, but real teams making real decisions\n- This might support 20-30% of residual profit in Ireland, defensibly\n- Yes, this costs money. It also survives audit.\n\n**2. R&D Tax Relief Optimisation (UK)**\n- If there's qualifying R&D activity, the UK's own regime can significantly reduce the effective rate\n- Enhanced deductions or expenditure credits can bring the effective UK rate down materially\n\n**3. Patent Box (UK)**\n- If IP generates qualifying income, the UK Patent Box taxes it at **10%** — lower than Ireland's 12.5%\n- The irony: the UK may already offer a lower rate than Ireland for the right income streams\n\n**4. Genuine IP Development in Ireland**\n- If new IP is developed (not transferred) by a real Irish team, future profits from that IP can legitimately sit in Ireland\n- This is a forward-looking strategy, not a retrospective profit shift\n\n**5. Holding and Financing Structures**\n- Legitimate group financing arrangements with Irish entities can achieve modest but defensible tax efficiencies\n- Within transfer pricing constraints\n\n### Realistic Combined Outcome\n\nA well-executed version of the above might achieve an **effective global rate of 15-19%** versus the headline 25% UK rate. That's meaningful. It's not the 12.5% fantasy, but it's real money that survives scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n## The Conversation You Need to Have\n\nIf the client insists on >50% profit to Ireland without genuine substance relocation, you have three options:\n\n1. **Decline the engagement** — because the advice they want cannot be given responsibly\n2. **Refer to a firm willing to be more aggressive** — understanding the reputational implications\n3. **Persuade them that the legitimate optimisation is worth doing** — because saving 6-10 percentage points on a defensible basis is commercially significant\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nThe era where legal structures alone could override economic substance is over. That's not a cautious interpretation — it's the settled position after a decade of international reform. Any adviser telling the client otherwise is selling them a future dispute with HMRC that they will very likely lose, plus penalties.\n\nThe best advice is sometimes telling the client that what they want cannot be done the way they want it done — and showing them what *can* be done instead.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 121, "completion_tokens": 990, "total_tokens": 1111}, "latency_s": 25.350091041997075, "request_id": "chatcmpl-1aa6071a-c7be-4cd2-8d9d-0d2ece2de8c9", "raw_response": null}
