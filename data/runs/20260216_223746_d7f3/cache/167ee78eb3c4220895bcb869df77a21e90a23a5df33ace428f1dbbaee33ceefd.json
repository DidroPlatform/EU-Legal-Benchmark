Statement ii is incorrect: Swiss commercial law is not based on a comprehensive codification from the 2000s. Switzerland's civil code (ZGB) dates from 1907/1912, and its Code of Obligations serves as commercial law. There was no comprehensive commercial codification in the 2000s. Statement iii is incorrect: The Digest (Pandects) had an enormous impact on the Western legal tradition - it was the centerpiece of the revival of Roman law in medieval universities and the foundation of the ius commune. Saying it had only marginal impact compared to the Justinian Code is wrong. Statement iv is correct: Luhmann's systems theory identifies the political system's binary code as power/not-power (Macht/Nicht-Macht). So statements ii and iii are incorrect, making H the answer.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 291, "completion_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 537}, "latency_s": 8.03903833401273, "request_id": "chatcmpl-22f8dadb-e935-4947-9afe-826dcb3b677a", "raw_response": null}
