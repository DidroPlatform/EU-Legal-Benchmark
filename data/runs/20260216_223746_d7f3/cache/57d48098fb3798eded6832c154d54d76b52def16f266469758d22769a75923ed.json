The candidate answer proposes using a 'Broker-Led IOR Proxy' who acts as an agent, but it does not explicitly state or confirm that this UK entity (the broker/proxy) must be jointly and severally liable under an *indirect representation agreement* as required by UK customs law for this structure to be legally sound regarding liability insulation. The answer focuses on contractual indemnification and the broker using their own EORI, which implies direct liability for the broker, but it fails to use the specific legal terminology ('jointly and severally liable' under 'indirect representation') required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"566fd9ff-4870-40ea-bad8-2cfc7888257d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2299, "completion_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 2493}, "latency_s": 0.8448720420128666, "request_id": "8iaVaanpNLzhnsEPwLCgiQY", "raw_response": null}
