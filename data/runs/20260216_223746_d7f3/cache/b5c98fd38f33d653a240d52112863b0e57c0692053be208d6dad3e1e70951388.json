English courts routinely grant such relief in support of foreign arbitrations, provided certain conditions are met. This is not overridden by the arbitration clause, which primarily governs substantive disputes rather than ancillary interim measures.\n\nThe key legal basis is **section 44 of the Arbitration Act 1996** (as amended), which empowers English courts to grant interim relief \"for the purposes of arbitral proceedings,\" including:\n- Freezing orders to secure disputed amounts (s44(2)(a) and (b)).\n- Orders for the preservation of assets.\n\nThis power extends to **foreign-seated arbitrations** (like Singapore), but with safeguards under **s44(2A) and s44(5)**:\n- The court will not act if the arbitral tribunal (or a court with more appropriate jurisdiction) has already granted, refused, or is likely to grant/refuse the relief.\n- Relief is available if it is **urgent**, the tribunal cannot be approached promptly, or other exceptional circumstances apply.\n- Permission from the tribunal is often sought first as a matter of comity, but not always required.\n\nAdditionally, English courts have **inherent jurisdiction** under CPR 25 (Interim Injunctions) to grant worldwide or jurisdiction-specific freezing orders if:\n- There is a serious issue to be tried.\n- The balance of convenience favours the order (e.g., real risk of asset dissipation).\n- The claimant has a good arguable case on jurisdiction (often via service out under CPR 6.36–6.37, based on assets in England/Wales, a contract with English governing law, or submission to jurisdiction).\n\nIn practice, injunctions often target **assets within the jurisdiction** (e.g., UK bank accounts) to avoid extraterritorial overreach, though worldwide orders are possible against foreign defendants with sufficient UK connections.\n\n### How English Courts Balance Jurisdiction Against the Arbitration Clause\n\nEnglish courts prioritise upholding arbitration agreements (per **s9 Arbitration Act 1996**, mandating stays of substantive proceedings, and the pro-arbitration policy under the New York Convention). However, they balance this against their **supportive role** in ensuring arbitration's effectiveness. The arbitration clause does **not oust court jurisdiction** for interim relief—doing so would allow parties to dissipate assets and render awards nugatory.\n\n#### Balancing Framework (Key Principles and Tests)\nCourts apply a **two-stage test** for freezing injunctions generally (*American Cyanamid* principles, adapted), plus arbitration-specific considerations:\n\n1. **Threshold Jurisdictional Hurdles**:\n   - **Good arguable case** on the underlying claim (even if arbitrable).\n   - **Real risk of dissipation** (e.g., evidence of asset transfers).\n   - **Assets within reach** (UK assets make enforcement straightforward; foreign assets require caution to avoid conflicting with Singapore courts).\n\n2. **Arbitration-Specific Balancing (s44 and Case Law)**:\n   | Factor | How Courts Weigh It | Supporting Authority |\n   |--------|---------------------|----------------------|\n   | **Support for Arbitration** | Relief must aid, not undermine, the arbitration (e.g., preserve assets for award enforcement). Courts intervene if tribunal relief is unavailable/unlikely. | *Cetelem SA v Roust Holdings Ltd* [2005] EWCA Civ 618: Freezing injunction upheld in support of Russian arbitration. |\n   | **Urgency & Tribunal Involvement** | No order if tribunal can grant equivalent relief promptly; \"likely to refuse\" test applied flexibly. | *Perusahaan Penerbangan Malaysia v Swissport* [2010] EWHC 1294 (Comm): Urgent UK relief granted pending tribunal decision. |\n   | **Comity & Parallel Proceedings** | Deference to Singapore seat/courts, but English courts act if UK assets at risk. No automatic stay under s9 (applies to substantive claims only). | *The Angelic Grace* [1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 87: Worldwide freezing order valid despite arbitration clause. |\n   | **Contractual Terms** | Exclusive jurisdiction clause? Rare conflict, as s44 overrides unless parties \"otherwise agree.\" Singapore arbitration clause doesn't preclude. | *Enka Insaat v OOO Insurance* [2020] UKSC 38: Arbitration agreement law doesn't bar supportive relief. |\n   | **Balance of Convenience** | Weighs claimant's need vs. defendant's harm; often tips toward preservation if low \"undertaking in damages\" risk. | CPR 25.03; *Fourie v Le Roux* [2007] UKHL 1. |\n\n3. **Practical Outcomes**:\n   - **Injunction Stands**: Common if UK assets exist and dissipation risk is high (e.g., *Gloster v GFL* [2016] EWHC 2743 (Comm) – freezing order in aid of LCIA arbitration upheld against foreign entity).\n   - **Potential Challenges**: Defendant can apply to discharge (CPR 25.10) or seek anti-suit injunction from Singapore tribunal/courts. English courts may modify (e.g., limit to UK assets) to respect arbitration.\n   - **Enforcement**: Post-award, English courts aid via s44(5) or New York Convention (Ch I/II).\n\n#### Strategic Considerations\n- **Claimant**: Seek ex parte if urgent; notify tribunal promptly.\n- **Defendant (Foreign Company)**: Challenge jurisdiction, seek discharge, or apply to Singapore courts for counter-relief (Singapore International Arbitration Act mirrors UNCITRAL Model Law).\n- **Cross-Border Dynamics**: EU/UK post-Brexit no longer bound by Brussels I Recast, but common law comity applies. Singapore courts (pro-arbitration) may defer if no local assets.\n\nIn summary, the injunction is likely enforceable as **supportive ancillary relief**, with courts deftly balancing pro-arbitration policy against practical justice. Outcomes turn on facts (e.g., asset location, urgency).
