Specifically, under Section 3 ('Arbitration strategy'), it recommends immediate containment steps, including preparing for emergency relief (which implies filing first or being ready to file immediately upon the German party's action) and asserting jurisdiction in the Answer/Counterclaims. Furthermore, Section 3.B states the goal is to 'assert tribunal jurisdiction over all claims and request an order that the German party discontinue/threaten no court proceedings,' and Section 3.C suggests 'presenting first so as not to be on the defensive.' Section 1.E discusses seeking an English court anti-suit injunction, which is a proactive step to prevent German litigation. The strategy clearly aims to frame the issue as a breach of contract, control timing, present first, and prevent German court litigation.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b3b4595a-b14f-442f-84fc-b1ac2fc6c311\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3310, "completion_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 3539}, "latency_s": 0.9906875000451691, "request_id": "-R6VadqsOa_5vdIP_s_aiAw", "raw_response": null}
