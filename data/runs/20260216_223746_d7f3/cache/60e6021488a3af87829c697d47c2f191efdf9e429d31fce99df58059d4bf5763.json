{"provider": "nim", "model": "z-ai/glm5", "text": "It is important to clarify a distinction in French publishing law immediately: **you do not legally have the power to set the price of your book.**\n\nUnder French law, the setting of the selling price to the public is the exclusive prerogative of the **publisher** (éditeur), not the author. This applies to both physical books and e-books (since the 2011 reform extending the \"Loi Lang\" to digital formats).\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your negotiation margins regarding the price, and the specific risks associated with your project.\n\n### 1. The Legal Reality: Who sets the price?\nThe famous **\"Loi Lang\" (Law n°81-766 of August 10, 1981)** states that the publisher determines the retail price of the book. The author's consent is not legally required to set this price.\n\n*   **Your margin:** Strictly speaking, **zero**. You cannot force the publisher to price the book at €15 if they want to price it at €8.\n*   **The nuance:** While you cannot impose a price, you can discuss the *editorial strategy*. If the price is so high that it hinders sales, or so low that it devalues your work, you can argue for an adjustment. However, since this is an online-only publisher dealing with a niche product (annotated newspaper extracts), they likely have a strict pricing grid based on production costs and target audience.\n\n### 2. What you CAN negotiate: The Royalties (Droits d'auteur)\nSince you cannot control the price tag, your negotiation should focus on your percentage of that price.\n\n*   **The Standard:** In France, print royalties usually range from 8% to 12% of the net selling price (Prix de vente HT). For e-books, the percentage is often higher (often 15% to 25% or more) because there are no printing/shipping costs.\n*   **Your Margin:** You should negotiate this percentage. Since your book is a compilation, the publisher might try to offer a lower rate than a standard novel. You should push to keep this as high as possible, as this is your only financial lever.\n\n### 3. The \"Elephant in the Room\": Copyright Status of the Articles\nThis is the most critical point regarding your negotiation power. You mentioned the book is a \"collection of extracts of newspaper articles.\"\n\n**This puts you in a very weak legal and negotiating position.**\n\nIf the newspaper articles are not in the public domain (i.e., if they were written less than 70 years after the death of the author), **you do not own the rights to the content you are \"publishing.\"**\n\n*   **The Risk:** Publishing these extracts without permission from the original newspapers/authors is copyright infringement (contrefaçon).\n*   **The Publisher's Leverage:** A reputable publisher will likely demand that you secure the rights (authorizations) to reproduce these texts. If you cannot, they may refuse to publish. If they agree to publish without clearing rights, they are taking a massive legal risk.\n*   **Fair Use / Short Citation:** In France, the \"right of short citation\" (droit de courte citation) exists, but it requires that the extract is short and justified by the critical analysis (your annotations). If your book reproduces entire articles or long chunks, this exception does not apply.\n\n**How this affects price negotiation:**\nIf you are asking the publisher to take on the legal risk of publishing copyrighted material without clearance, they will likely set the price however they want and likely offer you a very low royalty rate (or a one-time flat fee) to offset their liability risk. Conversely, if you have already secured all permissions, your negotiation margin improves significantly.\n\n### 4. Summary of your Negotiation Strategy\n\nDo not waste your \"negotiation capital\" trying to set the price. Instead, focus on:\n\n1.  **Royalty Rate:** Negotiate a percentage of the Net Public Price (HT). Aim for **15-25% for an e-book** format.\n2.  **Advances (À-valoir):** Try to negotiate an advance on future royalties.\n3.  **Copyright Indemnity:** Ensure the contract specifies who is responsible if the original newspapers sue for copyright. (Publishers will try to make the author warrant that the work is original; you need to be careful here because your work is *not* original in its text, only in its selection/annotation).\n\n**Recommendation:**\nSince the work is a compilation of third-party text, the \"value\" is in your annotations. If the publisher is purely online, their overhead is low. Ask for a high royalty percentage on e-books, but let them decide the price point based on their market research.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a lawyer. French publishing contracts can be complex, and given the copyright issues regarding newspaper extracts, you should ideally consult with a literary agent or a lawyer specializing in intellectual property (droit de la propriété intellectuelle).*", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 74, "completion_tokens": 2135, "total_tokens": 2209}, "latency_s": 95.86777254100889, "request_id": "chatcmpl-9976290c56039539", "raw_response": null}
