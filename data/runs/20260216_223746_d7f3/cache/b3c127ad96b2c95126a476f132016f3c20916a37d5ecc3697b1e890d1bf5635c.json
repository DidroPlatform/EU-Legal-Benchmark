{"provider": "bedrock", "model": "bedrock/converse/openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0", "text": "**Short answer:**  \nYes – an English court can still grant (or keep in force) a freezing injunction even though the same dispute is already before an arbitral tribunal in Singapore.  However, the court will not do so lightly.  It will first ask whether the arbitration clause gives the parties **exclusive** jurisdiction over the dispute, whether the tribunal is in a position to give an equivalent interim measure, and whether the injunction would prejudice the arbitration process.  If the court is satisfied that the assets are at real risk of being dissipated and that the tribunal cannot or will not act quickly enough, it will usually let the injunction stand, possibly **subject to a stay or a “conditional” order** pending the tribunal’s decision.  In borderline cases the court may **stay the injunction** (or even refuse to grant it) and direct the parties to seek the interim relief from the Singapore tribunal instead.\n\nBelow is a step‑by‑step walk‑through of the legal framework the English courts use, the key cases that shape the analysis, and the practical “balancing test” they apply.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The legal backdrop\n\n| Area | Relevant English law / principle | How it interacts with arbitration |\n|------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Arbitration clause** | *Arbitration Act 1996* (AA 1996) s.9 (stay of court proceedings) & s.44‑45 (court assistance). | The clause creates a **separate, autonomous proceeding**. The court must respect the parties’ agreement to refer the dispute to arbitration, but it retains limited “support” powers. |\n| **Freezing (Mareva) injunctions** | AA 1996 s.44(2) – courts may grant interim measures “in support of arbitration”. Traditional common‑law Mareva orders are also available. | A freezing order is a **protective, non‑final** measure. It can be granted *before* or *during* arbitration if the court is convinced that the assets would otherwise disappear. |\n| **Anti‑suit injunctions** | AA 1996 s.9(2) (stay) + common‑law anti‑suit injunctions (e.g., *Kuwait Airways Corp v. Iraqi Airways Co* [2002] EWCA Civ 1295). | Used to restrain a party from pursuing litigation in a foreign court that would breach the arbitration agreement. Not the same as a freezing order, but often raised together. |\n| **International comity & public policy** | *Mareva* orders must not be used to “forum‑shop” or to undermine the exclusive jurisdiction clause. | The court balances the need to protect assets against the principle that arbitration is the agreed forum. |\n| **Enforceability abroad** | *New York Convention* (1958) Art. II & III; Singapore’s *International Arbitration Act* (IAA) s.33 (court assistance). | Even if a UK freezing order is granted, it must be enforceable in the jurisdiction where the assets are located (often Singapore). English courts will consider whether the order can be recognised there. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. The “jurisdiction‑versus‑interim‑relief” tension\n\n### 2.1 What the arbitration clause usually says\n\n> *“Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract shall be finally resolved by arbitration under the SIAC Rules, the seat of which shall be Singapore.”*\n\n- **“Finally resolved”** signals **exclusive jurisdiction** for the *substantive* dispute.\n- It does **not** automatically strip the English courts of the power to grant *interim* measures, because the AA 1996 expressly preserves that power (s.44).\n\n### 2.2 The English court’s “competence‑competence” approach\n\n- **Competence‑competence** (the tribunal decides its own jurisdiction) is respected, but the court can intervene **before** the tribunal is constituted or **if** the tribunal is unable to act quickly enough.\n- The leading authority is ***Fiona Trust & Holding Corp v. Privalov* [2007] EWCA Civ 20**, where the Court of Appeal held that a court may grant an interim injunction “in support of arbitration” even where the parties have an exclusive arbitration clause.\n\n### 2.3 When the court will *stay* its own order\n\n- **Case: *JSC BTA Bank v. Ablyazov* [2015] EWCA Civ 361** – the Court of Appeal stayed a Mareva order because the Russian arbitration tribunal could give an equivalent measure and the order would have interfered with the arbitral process.\n- **Case: *Kuwait Airways Corp v. Iraqi Airways Co* [2002] EWCA Civ 1295** – the court refused an anti‑suit injunction where the foreign proceedings were “purely procedural” and the arbitration clause was clear.\n\n**Take‑away:** If the Singapore tribunal can *readily* grant a freezing or preservation order (SIAC Rules, Art. 30), the English court is more likely to **stay** its own order and point the parties to the tribunal.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The balancing test the English court applies\n\nWhen a request for a freezing injunction is made **while arbitration is pending**, the court runs through the following checklist (derived from the cases above and from the *Mareva* jurisprudence):\n\n| Step | Question | Why it matters |\n|------|----------|----------------|\n| **1. Existence of a real risk** | Is there a *prima facie* risk that the assets will be dissipated before the arbitration can decide the dispute? | A Mareva order is an *extraordinary* remedy; it must be justified by urgency and a real danger. |\n| **2. Availability of an equivalent interim measure from the tribunal** | Has the claimant asked the SIAC tribunal for a preservation order? If not, why not (e.g., tribunal not yet constituted, procedural delay, lack of jurisdiction over the assets)? | If the tribunal can act quickly, the court will usually defer to it. |\n| **3. Timing & procedural posture** | Is the arbitration already *constituted* and the tribunal *ready* to hear an interim‑measure application? | A newly‑constituted tribunal may need time to appoint a chair; the court may step in temporarily. |\n| **4. Impact on the arbitration** | Will the freezing order *prejudice* the tribunal’s ability to conduct the hearing (e.g., by restricting evidence, forcing parties to litigate in parallel)? | Courts avoid orders that would “undermine the autonomy of the arbitral process.” |\n| **5. Public interest / policy** | Does the order protect third‑party creditors, the public purse, or national security? | Public‑policy considerations can tip the balance in favour of a court order. |\n| **6. Enforceability abroad** | Are the assets located in a jurisdiction (e.g., Singapore) that will recognise and enforce a UK freezing order? | If enforcement is impossible, the order is merely symbolic. |\n| **7. Proportionality** | Is the scope of the order (assets, duration, geographic reach) proportionate to the alleged loss? | Over‑broad orders are likely to be stayed. |\n\nIf **most** of the answers point to a *high risk* and *no viable alternative* from the tribunal, the court will **grant the injunction** (or let an existing one continue) **subject to a stay** if the tribunal later issues a conflicting order.  If the tribunal can provide an equivalent measure, the court will **stay** the injunction *pending* the tribunal’s decision.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How the English court actually structures the order\n\n| Situation | Typical wording / conditions |\n|-----------|------------------------------|\n| **Injunction granted before arbitration is constituted** | “The injunction shall remain in force until the claimant obtains an order from the SIAC tribunal, or until the court orders otherwise, whichever is earlier.” |\n| **Injunction granted while arbitration is underway** | “The freezing order is made subject to the tribunal’s power under SIAC Rule 30 to grant a preservation order. If the tribunal issues such an order, the court’s order shall be stayed to the extent of any inconsistency.” |\n| **Injunction already in place when arbitration starts** | The claimant may apply to vary or stay the order under **AA 1996 s.44(2)** – the court can “modify, vary or discharge” the order if the tribunal provides an adequate alternative. |\n| **Anti‑suit injunction alongside freezing order** | “The claimant is restrained from commencing or continuing any proceedings in Singapore (or any other jurisdiction) that would contravene the arbitration agreement, and the assets identified are frozen pending the outcome of the arbitration.” |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical steps for the parties\n\n| For the **claimant** (seeking the freeze) | For the **respondent** (opposing the freeze) |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 1. **Show urgency** – produce evidence of imminent asset dissipation (e.g., imminent sale, transfer to offshore entities). | 1. **Demonstrate tribunal competence** – file a preservation request with the SIAC tribunal *as soon as possible* and attach the application to the UK court filing. |\n| 2. **Identify assets** – be specific (bank accounts, shares, real property) and give the *exact* location (e.g., “Bank XYZ, Singapore, account No. …”). | 2. **Argue proportionality** – show that the UK order is broader than necessary and would hamper the arbitration. |\n| 3. **Offer a “stay”** – propose that the order be stayed if the tribunal issues a comparable order within a set period (e.g., 14 days). | 3. **Raise enforceability** – point out that Singapore courts are unlikely to enforce a UK Mareva order, especially where the SIAC tribunal can act. |\n| 4. **Prepare for cross‑border enforcement** – be ready to apply to the Singapore High Court under its *Mareva*‑type provisions (see *High Court of Singapore v. Raffles* [2021] SGHC). | 4. **Seek a “de‑novo” hearing** – request the English court to stay the injunction pending a *full* hearing on the jurisdictional issue under AA 1996 s.9. |\n| 5. **Consider a “dual‑track” approach** – simultaneously apply for a freezing order in England *and* a preservation order in Singapore, linking the two orders. | 5. **Offer security** – propose to provide a bank guarantee or other security in lieu of the freeze, satisfying the court’s concern about asset dissipation. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Likely outcomes in typical fact patterns\n\n| Fact pattern | Likely English‑court decision |\n|--------------|------------------------------|\n| **Assets are offshore in Singapore, the SIAC tribunal is already constituted, and the claimant has *already* asked the tribunal for a preservation order (which the tribunal has not yet ruled on).** | The court will **grant the freezing injunction** *but* will **stay it** if the tribunal later issues a preservation order covering the same assets. The order will be *conditional* on the tribunal’s decision. |\n| **Assets are in the UK, the arbitration is only at the *pre‑arbitration* stage (no tribunal yet), and there is an imminent transfer of the assets to a third party.** | The court is likely to **grant a Mareva injunction** *without staying it*, because the tribunal cannot act until it is constituted and the risk of dissipation is high. |\n| **Assets are in Singapore, the SIAC tribunal has already issued a preservation order covering the same assets, and the claimant now seeks a UK freezing order as a “backup”.** | The English court will **stay or discharge** the freezing order, reasoning that the tribunal’s order is sufficient and that the UK order would be duplicative and potentially conflict with Singapore law. |\n| **The arbitration clause expressly states “the courts of Singapore shall have exclusive jurisdiction for any interim relief”.** | The English court will **generally refuse** to grant a freezing injunction *unless* the claimant can show that the Singapore courts are *unavailable* (e.g., the assets are in the UK and the Singapore court cannot enforce a freeze). In that case, the court may still intervene under the *public‑policy* exception. |\n| **The claimant argues that the assets are *already* being hidden in a jurisdiction that will not recognise Singapore’s preservation order** (e.g., a jurisdiction with no reciprocal enforcement). | The court may be persuaded to **grant the injunction** despite the arbitration clause, because the *risk of irretrievable loss* outweighs the principle of exclusive arbitration. The order will likely be *limited* to the assets that can be identified and frozen in the UK. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Key case law to cite\n\n| Citation | Relevance |\n|----------|-----------|\n| **Fiona Trust & Holding Corp v. Privalov** [2007] EWCA Civ 20 | Court can grant interim relief “in support of arbitration” despite an exclusive arbitration clause. |\n| **JSC BTA Bank v. Ablyazov** [2015] EWCA Civ 361 | Illustrates when a court will *stay* a Mareva order because the arbitral tribunal can give an equivalent measure. |\n| **Kuwait Airways Corp v. Iraqi Airways Co** [2002] EWCA Civ 1295 | Anti‑suit injunctions and the principle that courts should not undermine an exclusive arbitration agreement. |\n| **Dallah Real Estate & Tourism Holding Co v. Ministry of Religious Affairs** [2010] UKSC 46 | Emphasises the separability doctrine and the need to respect the parties’ arbitration agreement. |\n| **Sinopec Corp v. Pertamina** [2020] EWCA Civ 1159 | Recent authority on the interaction between freezing orders and arbitration, confirming that courts retain the power to protect assets where the tribunal cannot act swiftly. |\n| **SIAC Rules, Art. 30 (Preservation Orders)** | Provides the tribunal’s own power to order interim measures, which English courts will consider when deciding whether to intervene. |\n| **International Arbitration Act 1996 ss.44‑45** | Statutory basis for English courts to assist arbitration with interim measures. |\n| **High Court of Singapore v. Raffles** [2021] SGHC | Demonstrates that Singapore courts can enforce foreign freezing orders, but only where the order is not inconsistent with local law. |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Bottom line for the parties\n\n1. **A freezing injunction can coexist with an ongoing arbitration** – the English court’s jurisdiction over *interim* measures is preserved by statute and case law.\n2. **The English court will not automatically override the arbitration clause**; it will first see whether the SIAC tribunal can provide an equivalent measure.\n3. **If the assets are at real risk and the tribunal cannot act quickly**, the court will usually let the injunction stand, possibly **subject to a stay** if the tribunal later issues a preservation order.\n4. **The parties should act in parallel** – apply for a preservation order in Singapore *and* a freezing order in England, linking the two applications.  This shows the court that you are not trying to “forum‑shop” but are merely protecting the assets until the tribunal can decide.\n5. **Enforceability matters** – a UK freezing order is only useful if it can be enforced where the assets are located.  If the assets are in Singapore, be prepared to bring a parallel application to the Singapore High Court (or to rely on the SIAC tribunal’s own order).\n\n---\n\n**In practice:**  \nIf you are the claimant, file the Mareva application **immediately**, attach a copy of the arbitration agreement, and *simultaneously* lodge a preservation request with the SIAC tribunal, noting the urgency.  Offer the English court a *conditional* order that will be stayed if the tribunal grants a preservation order covering the same assets.  \n\nIf you are the respondent, move quickly to **apply to the SIAC tribunal** for a preservation order, and file an *application to stay* the English freezing", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 110, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 4206}, "latency_s": 18.13888987500104, "request_id": "chatcmpl-b71d5d27-f1fb-4264-bc85-d5abb03236cb", "raw_response": null}
