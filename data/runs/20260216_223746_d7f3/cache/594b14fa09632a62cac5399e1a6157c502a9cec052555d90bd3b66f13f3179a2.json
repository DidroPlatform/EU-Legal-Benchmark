The candidate answer addresses this in Section 3, Step 1, where it recommends a scope covering 'All employers with \\u2265 50 employees' and mentions a 'phased rollout' for smaller firms. Furthermore, the case studies explicitly mention the UK threshold of \\u2265 250 employees (Section 4.1) and the California exemption for firms with < 5 employees (Section 4.3). While it does not explicitly mention the EU's 100-employee threshold, it discusses relevant thresholds (UK 250, CA <5, proposed \\u226550) and the concept of varying thresholds based on firm size, which satisfies the intent of the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"e97a4366-ff65-4465-bcdc-0ab4dc780a45\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4476, "completion_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 4718}, "latency_s": 0.9431348330108449, "request_id": "gvGUaeyUGZzw7M8Pu9TR-AQ", "raw_response": null}
