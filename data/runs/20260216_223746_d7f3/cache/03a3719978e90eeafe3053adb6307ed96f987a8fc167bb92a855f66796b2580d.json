It states, \\\"EU law recognizes parody as an exception (Case C-201/13, *Deckmyn*)\\\" and later notes that the third shirt has the \\\"Strongest parody defense.\\\" While the US analysis uses the term 'fair use' which encompasses parody, the criterion specifically asks if the response states that satire uses the original work as a vehicle to comment on a different issue. The discussion of parody in the Italian section clearly aligns with this definition by discussing commentary and mockery related to an issue (worker's rights or the show's joke) using the original work.\", \"criterion_id\": \"a9c831d9-dab7-42a9-b899-db182e763205\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1735, "completion_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 1928}, "latency_s": 0.9644157500006258, "request_id": "19SUaailGL-xnsEPuMqioQI", "raw_response": null}
