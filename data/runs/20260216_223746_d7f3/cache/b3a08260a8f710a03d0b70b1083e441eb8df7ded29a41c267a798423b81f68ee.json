The candidate answer references R v Keane and McGrath [2010] EWCA Crim 2514, but it discusses the principle that self-defence fails if the force used is 'wholly disproportionate' to the perceived threat, not specifically the 'revival' of the defence based on the victim's retaliation being disproportionate to the client's *initial* attack. The facts presented are that the victim attacked first, and the client retaliated. The principle cited in the criterion seems to relate to a scenario where the defendant initiated force, and the victim responded, requiring the defendant's subsequent use of force to be proportionate to the victim's response (a situation often arising when the initial aggressor claims self-defence against the victim's counter-attack). Since the client claims the victim attacked first, the focus should be on the proportionality of the client's response to the perceived threat, not the proportionality of the victim's initial attack relative to the client's claimed minor attack. The candidate answer correctly addresses proportionality in the context of the client's response to the perceived threat, but it does not apply the specific nuance described in the criterion regarding the 'revival' of the defence based on the victim's disproportionate retaliation to the client's *initial* attack.\", \"criterion_id\": \"653cb3de-b54e-4fad-a0f4-e0a95a9f150d\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4311, "completion_tokens": 367, "total_tokens": 4678}, "latency_s": 1.479580499988515, "request_id": "9kmUaZOWN8fxvdIPiqGnqQM", "raw_response": null}
