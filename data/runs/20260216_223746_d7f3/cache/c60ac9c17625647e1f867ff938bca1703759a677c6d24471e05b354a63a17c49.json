The candidate answer discusses the infringement by the fizzy drink company under points like 'Substantial copying' and 'Moral rights violation' but it never explicitly identifies the specific infringement as 'communicating the work to the public' (which is a key right infringed under UK law, Section 20 CDPA 1988, when the work is shown in the ad). It focuses more on the character use and moral rights rather than the specific primary liability act of communication to the public by the advertiser.\", \"criterion_id\": \"8f6d433b-a70f-49a9-8c12-1e412a5878ec\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1223, "completion_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 1404}, "latency_s": 0.8305597919970751, "request_id": "486UafbWN_minsEP9fLK0AM", "raw_response": null}
