Your room to negotiate depends mainly on **(1) whether it qualifies as a “book” under French rules**, **(2) the distribution model (e‑book only, subscription, bundles, etc.)**, and **(3) what your publishing contract says**.\n\nBelow is the practical/legal landscape and where you typically have leverage.\n\n## 1) First check: do you actually have the rights to publish this?\nBecause your work is “extracts of newspaper articles that you annotated and regrouped,” the key issue is **copyright clearance**.\n\n- **Newspaper articles are protected works**. Reproducing “extracts” can still require permission, depending on length/substantiality and purpose.\n- **Quotation (“courte citation”)** in French law can be allowed, but only under strict conditions (short, justified by critical/polemical/educational/scientific purpose, source and author credited, and not competing with the original). A compilation of extracts can exceed what counts as “short quotation,” especially if the extracts are a significant part of the work.\n- If rights aren’t cleared, **a publisher may refuse, shift liability to you, or demand warranties/indemnities**.\n\nThis matters for pricing because if the publisher faces rights risk, they may insist on a lower price, or refuse wide distribution.\n\n## 2) Who legally sets the retail price?\n### If your editor sells in France as a “book” (including an e‑book)\nFrance has fixed book price rules:\n- **Print**: the publisher sets a public retail price, retailers must comply (with limited discount rules).\n- **E‑books**: there’s also a fixed price regime for digital books sold to the public in France (with some nuances depending on buyer type and whether it’s a “book” as defined).\n\n**In practice:** the **publisher sets the retail price**, but the contract can provide that:\n- the publisher sets it **after consultation** with the author;\n- the author’s **written consent** is required for price changes;\n- or a **price range/floor** is agreed.\n\nSo your “legal margin” is mostly **contractual negotiation**, not a default statutory right.\n\n### If it’s not treated as a “book” (e.g., a subscription database, press review service, or continuously updated content)\nPricing is more flexible (no fixed book price constraints), but then it may not be distributed as a conventional e‑book and the contract structure may look more like a content license.\n\n## 3) What you can realistically negotiate in the contract (your main levers)\nEven when the publisher sets the public price, you can negotiate mechanisms that indirectly or directly control it:\n\n### A) Consultation/approval over price\nAsk for a clause like:\n- **“Prix de vente fixé d’un commun accord”** (set by mutual agreement), or at least  \n- **consultation + reasoned notice**, or  \n- **approval required for any change** (including promotions, free offers, bundling).\n\n### B) Royalty base and rate (this is often more important than sticker price)\nFor e‑books, royalties are commonly a percentage of:\n- **publisher’s net receipts** (net of platform commissions, VAT, etc.), or\n- **public price excluding VAT**.\n\nThese two bases can change your income dramatically. You can negotiate:\n- a **higher rate** for digital (often higher than print),\n- an **escalator** (higher % after X copies/revenue),\n- clear definitions of “net receipts” (what can be deducted and what cannot).\n\n### C) Promotional discounts and free periods\nPublishers often want freedom to do price promos. Negotiate:\n- maximum discount without your consent (e.g., not more than 20–30%),\n- limits on duration/frequency of promos,\n- whether freebies are allowed and whether they generate any remuneration.\n\n### D) Minimum price / price floor\nYou can ask for:\n- a **minimum public price** (or minimum net receipt per sale),\n- especially to avoid extreme discounting that devalues the work.\n\n### E) Reversion / termination if price harms exploitation\nA strong lever is a clause that if the publisher:\n- keeps the book at an excessively low price for too long, or\n- fails to exploit it “normally,”  \nthen rights revert to you.\n\n### F) Transparency and accounting\nYou’ll want:\n- platform-by-platform reporting,\n- audit rights,\n- clarity on VAT/commission deductions.\n\n## 4) Important: if the publisher is “exclusively online”\nTwo scenarios:\n1) **They publish and distribute an e‑book through major platforms (Amazon/Apple/Kobo, etc.)**  \n   You’ll be subject to platform pricing constraints and promo tools. Contract language matters a lot.\n\n2) **They sell only on their own site**  \n   More pricing flexibility, but less reach. You can more plausibly negotiate **mutual approval** of price changes.\n\n## 5) Concrete questions to ask your editor/publisher\n1) Who is the **publisher of record** (éditeur) and who is the **retailer** (diffuseur/plateforme)?\n2) Will it be distributed via **Amazon/Apple/Kobo** or only direct?\n3) What is the **royalty base** (public price ex‑VAT vs net receipts)?\n4) Can you see their **standard e‑book contract** and specifically the clauses on:\n   - “prix de vente,”\n   - promotions/free distribution,\n   - accounting,\n   - warranties/indemnities (especially relevant for press extracts).\n\n## 6) Practical negotiation position\n- Legally, you don’t have an automatic right to set the retail price; **you negotiate it**.\n- Your strongest leverage is: **you own (some of) the rights** and can choose not to license them—*but only if the underlying article extracts are legally usable*.\n- If you cannot clearly clear rights for the extracts, your leverage decreases because the publisher is taking on risk (or will try to push that risk onto you).\n\n## 7) If you want, I can help you map your exact margin\nIf you paste (or summarize) the key clauses of the proposed contract—especially:\n- price clause,\n- royalty clause,\n- promotion clause,\n- warranty/indemnity clause,\n- territory (France/world),\n- exclusivity and term,\nI can tell you what’s standard in France for e‑books and what’s worth pushing back on.\n\nAlso helpful: roughly how long are the extracts (a few lines vs paragraphs), and are the original articles recent or from multiple publications?
