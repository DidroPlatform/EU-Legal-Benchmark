The candidate answer discusses tenancy status, rent payment, and the lack of a formal agreement, which relates to the *legal basis* of the occupation, but it does not explicitly explain the legal concept or requirements of 'actual occupation' itself (which is often relevant in property law, especially concerning overriding interests or adverse possession, though the latter is dismissed). The explanation focuses on why the user might *not* be a tenant (no rent) rather than defining what 'actual occupation' means in a legal context.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5156a743-0fc5-43be-919c-2246befabacf\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 816, "completion_tokens": 165, "total_tokens": 981}, "latency_s": 0.6900745829916559, "request_id": "lseUaZ6ELbnu7M8P587SoAI", "raw_response": null}
