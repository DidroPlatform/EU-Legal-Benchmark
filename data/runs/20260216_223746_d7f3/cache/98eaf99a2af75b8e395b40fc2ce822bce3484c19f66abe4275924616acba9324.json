The candidate answer discusses various EU-level remedies (complaints to DPAs, Commission, CJEU), but it never explicitly mentions or explains the requirements of the EU State Liability framework (which typically involves a sufficiently serious breach of EU law by a Member State, a breach of an individual right conferred by EU law, and a direct causal link between the breach and the damage suffered). While challenging a national law before the CJEU (Section 4) touches upon similar concepts, the specific legal requirements of the State Liability doctrine are not explained as mandated by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"6b1a7582-8c59-4663-95e0-c92590cf3e4c\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2169, "completion_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 2360}, "latency_s": 1.2510949159623124, "request_id": "sfSUabXIM465kdUPytPImQM", "raw_response": null}
