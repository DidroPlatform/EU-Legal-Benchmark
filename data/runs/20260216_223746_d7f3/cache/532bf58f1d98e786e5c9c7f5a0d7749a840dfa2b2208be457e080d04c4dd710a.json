{"provider": "vercel_gateway", "model": "vercel_ai_gateway/openai/gpt-5.2", "text": "You have three separate problems that are getting conflated:\n\n1) **Importer of Record / declarant** (who is legally on the hook to HMRC and must have a UK EORI)  \n2) **Incoterms (EXW vs who actually exports/imports and who bears risk/cost)**  \n3) **Origin & customs classification** (mixed products in one container does *not* automatically “taint” origin—*if* you do declarations correctly at item level)\n\nBelow is a fast, legally defensible operating structure that keeps you shipping while insulating the French parent as much as practicable.\n\n---\n\n## 1) EXW is a red flag in the UK post‑Brexit reality—push back hard (but offer workable alternatives)\n\nIf the buyer’s new legal team insists on **EXW**, they are effectively saying: “we control export/import and you just make goods available.” In practice, **EXW from the EU is often non‑workable** because the non‑EU buyer may not be able to act as exporter in France/EU, and it creates VAT/export evidence problems.\n\n**Counter‑proposal that often satisfies US legal teams while solving compliance:**\n- **FCA (your premises), Incoterms 2020** (or **FCA named place of delivery**).  \n  Buyer controls main carriage, but you can still act as exporter and provide proper export docs and proof of export.\n- If they want you to arrange transport: **DAP UK** (you deliver, they import) or **DDP UK** (you import)—but DDP makes you the importer unless you use an IOR service.\n\nIf they won’t move off EXW, you can still operate—but you must structure the import correctly (see Sections 3–5).\n\n---\n\n## 2) Mixed container with different refrigerants does **not** force a single origin claim—origin is per line item\n\nYour forwarder’s warning sounds like confusion between:\n- **Origin (preferential/non‑preferential)**\n- **Classification (HS code)**\n- **“Mixed consignment” rules** (which matter for preference claims when using simplifications)\n\n### Key point\nUK customs entries are line‑based. A single customs entry can include multiple commodity codes and multiple origin statements **as separate item lines**.\n\nWhat can go wrong is not “one model taints the container,” but:\n- You (or the declarant) try to claim preference for everything under one blanket statement without adequate product‑level origin proof, or\n- The forwarder incorrectly tries to lodge one line for the whole container.\n\n### What you should do immediately\n1) **Confirm HS codes for Lyon and Alpine separately** (likely different if refrigerant changes compliance category/controls; even if HS stays the same, you still declare separate lines).  \n2) **Confirm origin qualification per model** under the applicable UK preferential regime (e.g., TCA EU-UK rules of origin, if you’re claiming preference).  \n3) Prepare **two origin evidence packs**, one per model:\n   - Supplier declarations/BOM/processing records\n   - Statement on origin (if you’re using it) tied to the specific model and HS code\n   - Any binding origin information you have (or consider applying if recurring)\n\n### Do you need two separate customs entries?\nUsually **no**. You typically can do **one entry with two (or more) lines**, each with:\n- its own commodity code\n- its own customs value\n- its own origin (EU / non‑EU)\n- its own preference claim status (claim / no claim)\n\n**Split into two entries only if**:\n- your broker’s system cannot handle mixed origin/preference correctly (that’s a broker problem), or\n- you need to segregate controlled goods / licensing requirements that truly can’t coexist on one entry (rare), or\n- you want risk isolation (e.g., claim preference for Lyon, don’t claim for Alpine; separate entries can reduce “blast radius” if audited—though line‑based audits already isolate fairly well).\n\n---\n\n## 3) The “we might become the IOR without a UK entity” issue: you have three viable structures\n\n### Option A (fastest, most insulating): **Use a UK IOR / fiscal rep service (indirect representation)**\nYou appoint a UK-established customs intermediary/IOR service provider that:\n- acts as **importer/declarant** (or imports in their name on your/consignee’s behalf, depending on the model),\n- handles UK VAT and duties through their mechanisms,\n- then delivers to the UK retailer.\n\n**Why this helps:** it removes your French parent from being the declarant/importer in the UK system.\n\n**Watch-outs:**\n- UK “fiscal representation” is not like some EU countries; for VAT you may still need UK VAT registration depending on the commercial flow (especially if you are treated as making the supply in the UK).\n- Contracts matter: you need a tight services agreement allocating liability, document retention, who owns the goods at import, and who bears duty/VAT cost.\n\nThis is commonly the “do it in days” solution.\n\n### Option B (clean medium-term): **Create a UK subsidiary and register UK VAT + EORI**\n- UK Ltd becomes the importer/declarant, buys from FR parent, sells to retailer.\n- Keeps liability inside the UK entity ring-fence.\n- Operationally clean, bankable, scalable.\n\nDownside: not instantaneous (but can be done relatively quickly if pushed).\n\n### Option C (possible but riskier for insulation): **French parent imports using a UK EORI/VAT registration**\nA non‑UK business can register for a **UK EORI** and **UK VAT** and be the importer/declarant. This is legally possible, but it does **not** “insulate” the French parent—HMRC can pursue you directly.\n\nIf your goal is to structurally protect the parent from direct HMRC exposure, Option C is the opposite of what you want.\n\n---\n\n## 4) If the buyer refuses to be IOR, don’t let the commercial terms accidentally make you the UK supplier without planning VAT\n\nIf you become importer and then deliver to them in the UK, you may be treated as making a **UK domestic supply** (import + onward sale). That often triggers:\n- UK VAT registration requirements\n- invoicing and VAT accounting\n- potentially needing postponed VAT accounting (PVA) and/or VAT cashflow planning\n\nIf you instead structure it so the **buyer remains the importer** (despite EXW demand), they need to accept that role in practice. Their legal team currently refuses—so assume they won’t.\n\n**Therefore:** choose either **IOR service** (Option A) or **UK subsidiary** (Option B). Those are the two “insulating” structures.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Operational blueprint you can implement fast (recommended path)\n\n### Step 1 — Fix the customs entry design (do this immediately)\nTell your broker/forwarder:\n\n- Single container, **one import declaration**, with **two item lines** minimum:\n  - Line 1: Lyon — HS code X — origin status (EU?) — preference claim yes/no — qty/value\n  - Line 2: Alpine — HS code Y — origin status (EU?/non‑EU?) — preference claim yes/no — qty/value\n- If Alpine origin support is weaker: **do not claim preference** for Alpine; claim only for Lyon if fully substantiated.\n- Ensure any controlled-gas reporting requirements (if relevant) are handled per model.\n\nThis avoids doubling entries while isolating origin risk at line level.\n\n### Step 2 — Put an IOR/intermediary in place (fast insulation)\nEngage either:\n- a UK customs broker offering **indirect representation + IOR solution**, or\n- a specialist “importer of record” provider.\n\nContract must state:\n- They are the declarant/importer to HMRC (as applicable)\n- They hold records for audits\n- Indemnities are capped/defined (avoid open-ended parent exposure)\n- Who is responsible for origin claims (you provide evidence; they file what you instruct)\n- Who pays duty/VAT and how it’s recharged\n\n### Step 3 — Adjust Incoterms to match reality (even if buyer says EXW)\nEven if the buyer insists on EXW wording, insist on at least these controls:\n- You control export compliance from France/EU (to avoid export/VAT evidence problems), or\n- Use FCA and document it properly.\n\nIf they absolutely will not budge contract language, handle the practicalities via a side letter / logistics addendum:\n- who is “exporter of record” in France\n- who appoints the carrier\n- who provides export docs\n- who bears risk at which point\n\n### Step 4 — Documentation pack to prevent an “origin blow-up”\nFor each model, prepare a pack that can survive a HMRC verification request:\n- HS classification rationale\n- Preferential origin calculation/qualification file (if claiming)\n- Supplier declarations / LTSDs (where applicable)\n- Manufacturing statements\n- Separate SKU-level statements—no blanket statement across “air conditioners” generally\n\nThis is what prevents the “one model ruins the whole shipment” scenario.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Direct answers to your questions\n\n### “Do we split the shipment into two separate customs entries?”\nUsually **no**. Do **one entry with two lines** (separate HS/origin/preference per line). Split entries only if your intermediary cannot correctly process mixed lines or you want extra risk segregation.\n\n### “Is there a way to substantiate a single, unified origin claim for both models?”\nIf both models genuinely qualify under the same preferential origin rules and you have product-level proof, you can claim preference on both **within one entry**—but it’s still not a single “unified” claim; it’s two line claims supported separately. If Alpine is uncertain, claim preference only for Lyon.\n\n### “How do we structurally insulate our French parent from direct liability of being the declarant to HMRC?”\nFastest legally sound insulation:\n- **UK IOR/indirect rep service** (outsourced importer/declarant), or\n- **UK subsidiary** that becomes importer and seller.\n\nIf the French parent becomes UK EORI/VAT registered and acts as importer/declarant, you are **not insulated**.\n\n---\n\n## 7) What I need from you to give a precise, implementable plan (reply with bullet answers)\n\n1) Where are the goods shipping from (France warehouse?) and where are they manufactured?  \n2) Do Lyon and Alpine both currently qualify for EU preferential origin under TCA (based on your existing origin work), or is Alpine uncertain?  \n3) Are you selling directly to the UK retailer (single invoice FR→UK), or through distribution?  \n4) Do you already have a UK EORI or UK VAT registration?  \n5) Who is your customs broker in the UK, and can they do **indirect representation** / offer an IOR solution?  \n6) Any known regulatory constraints on R454B for UK import (quota/FGas obligations handled by buyer today)?\n\nWith those, I can recommend the cleanest Incoterm + contract addendum language, the customs entry structure (lines, preference strategy), and the lowest-risk importer model you can stand up in the shortest time.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 240, "completion_tokens": 2352, "total_tokens": 2592}, "latency_s": 53.75157187500736, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJ13XVXRXP3YR6PVCCJMCX", "raw_response": null}
