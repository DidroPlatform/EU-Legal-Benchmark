The candidate answer discusses the civil blast radius, mentioning punitive/exemplary damages and gross negligence, which are concepts relevant in both US and UK law (though punitive damages are rare in the UK). Crucially, the response does not explicitly mention or apply any specific US-style ratio limit (like a 9:1 multiplier) or incorrectly state the UK principle of full compensation. It focuses on the *admissibility* of the admission in civil cases, not the calculation of damages based on a specific jurisdiction's cap. Therefore, this specific criterion is not clearly violated.\", \"criterion_id\": \"42abff97-5213-4dd4-af7d-f21aac1cdd89\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2774, "completion_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 2964}, "latency_s": 0.9397960409987718, "request_id": "fhyVaeD3Lqnw7M8Pu5DvyAM", "raw_response": null}
