The candidate answer discusses the foreseeability of the swerve and contrasts *Roberts* with *Kennedy*, concluding that the swerve was a foreseeable reaction. However, it does not explicitly present the counter-argument that a *reasonable person* (implying a sober, non-impaired person) would have handled the situation differently (e.g., by braking or merging carefully) and that this failure to act reasonably constitutes a *novus actus interveniens* breaking the chain from the truck driver. The analysis focuses on whether the *type* of reaction (swerving) was foreseeable, not whether the *manner* of the reaction (crashing into another car due to impairment) was an intervening act that a reasonable person would have avoided.\", \"criterion_id\": \"59f0e49d-855e-44f4-bd5f-6e656891aa30\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2722, "completion_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 2979}, "latency_s": 1.31428716701339, "request_id": "lsKUafGeKJz07M8PqPy4oQI", "raw_response": null}
