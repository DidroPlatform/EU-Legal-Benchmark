The candidate answer explicitly addresses this under the 'JURY DIRECTIONS' section, stating: 'In assessing reasonableness of force, jury should consider: Client did not have time to weigh precisely what action to take... The circumstances as client believed them to be (including belief victim was armed)'. Furthermore, the entire brief is structured around the principle derived from case law (Williams, Beckford) and statute (s.76 CJIA 2008) that the jury must assess the reasonableness of force based on the facts as the defendant honestly believed them to be, which directly covers the scenario of a mistaken belief regarding the need for force (i.e., believing the victim was armed and thus needing to use the glass).\", \"criterion_id\": \"3638b3ae-0c64-4892-b3cc-fc12739096a1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2796, "completion_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 3039}, "latency_s": 0.9586935419938527, "request_id": "rcmUaefxPKGF7M8PzMbuaA", "raw_response": null}
