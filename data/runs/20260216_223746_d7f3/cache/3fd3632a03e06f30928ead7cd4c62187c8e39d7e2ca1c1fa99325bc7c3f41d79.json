Section 4, under the 'Italy' row, explicitly discusses the 'Dirigente' status, noting that it requires 'autonomous decision-making powers' and is 'not subject to the ordinary hierarchy.' It also details the tax benefits associated with this status. While the response does not explicitly use the phrase 'wrongfully employing... might result in a labor-law lawsuit,' it clearly establishes the legal distinction between 'Dirigente' and other roles, and details the specific requirements and benefits of the 'Dirigente' status, which implies that misclassification (e.g., using 'Quadro' when 'Dirigente' is appropriate) would lead to loss of benefits and potential legal challenge regarding the correct application of labor law and associated contributions/rights. The response addresses the core concept of correct managerial qualification in Italy.\", \"criterion_id\": \"05dcf770-c816-440d-abf5-4b4e9ed030fb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4749, "completion_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 5005}, "latency_s": 1.8190910840057768, "request_id": "B-mUaZXdK--0xN8PyOCmuQ4", "raw_response": null}
