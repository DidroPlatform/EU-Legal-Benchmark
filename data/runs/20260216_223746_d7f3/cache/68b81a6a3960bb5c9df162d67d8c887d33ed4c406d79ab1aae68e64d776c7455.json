Publishing laws can be complex and fact-specific (e.g., your contract details, the nature of your content, and any pre-existing rights). Consult a French literary agent, publishing lawyer, or organizations like the Société des Gens de Lettres (SGDL) or Syndicat National de l'Édition (SNE) for personalized guidance. French law applies here since your publisher is French.\n\n### Key Legal Framework: French Publishing Contracts\nYour situation falls under the **French Intellectual Property Code (Code de la Propriété Intellectuelle, CPI)**, particularly **Articles L.132-1 to L.132-17**, which strictly regulate publishing contracts (*contrats d'édition*). These are **mandatory clauses**—any contract missing them is null and void for those parts. Digital/online publishing (e-books, PDFs, etc.) is covered similarly to print, though with some ecommerce nuances.\n\nYour \"book\" (a compilation of annotated newspaper extracts) qualifies as a work if it's original (your annotations and regrouping add value). However:\n- **Copyright check**: Newspaper extracts are protected. You need permissions, fair use justification (*exception de courte citation*, Art. L.122-5 CPI), or public domain status. If not cleared, the publisher may demand fixes or refuse—impacting negotiations.\n\n### Your Legal Negotiation Margin on Pricing\nYou have **significant leverage** because pricing is **fully negotiable** upfront, with strong protections post-signature. Here's the breakdown:\n\n#### 1. **Contract Must Specify Price (Art. L.132-6 CPI)**\n   - The contract **must state**:\n     - The **retail price** (fixed, e.g., €9.99), or\n     - A **formula/method** to calculate it (e.g., based on production costs + margin).\n   - **Your margin**: Negotiate the exact price or formula. Propose a minimum price to protect perceived value. For online-exclusive, argue for dynamic pricing (e.g., adjustable based on sales data) but with your approval required for changes >10-20%.\n   - Online twist: E-books often use **publisher-set pricing** on platforms (Amazon, Kobo, etc.), but you can negotiate **your veto right** on changes.\n\n#### 2. **Author's Right to Object to \"Derisory\" Pricing (Art. L.132-9 CPI)**\n   - If the price is **manifestly too low** (e.g., €0.99 for a substantive work), you can **legally challenge it in court** and demand adjustment or contract termination.\n   - **Your margin**: Use this as leverage—insist on a price reflecting market comps (e.g., similar anthologies sell for €5-15 digitally). Provide evidence (sales data from similar titles via Electre or BookDB).\n\n#### 3. **Royalties: Your Biggest Leverage (Art. L.132-6)**\n   - Royalties are **percentage of retail price** (TTC, incl. VAT):\n     | Format       | Standard Range | Negotiable High |\n     |--------------|----------------|-----------------|\n     | E-book      | 15-25%        | 30-50%         |\n     | Print (if any) | 8-12%       | 15%            |\n   - **Your margin**: Push for **higher % + advances** (e.g., €500-2000 upfront). Negotiate **tiered royalties** (e.g., 20% up to 1,000 sales, 30% after). For online, demand **net receipts** (platform share after fees) if better.\n   - Minimum: Courts enforce ~10% if unspecified.\n\n#### 4. **Price Changes Post-Publication**\n   - Publisher can't change price **unilaterally** without notifying you (Art. L.132-7).\n   - **Your margin**: Negotiate **prior written approval** for any change. Right to terminate if sales < threshold (e.g., 300 copies in 3 years, Art. L.132-4).\n\n#### 5. **Online-Specific Considerations**\n   - **No resale price maintenance (RPM)** like print books (Law of 1981)—prices can be discounted by platforms/sellers.\n   - **VAT**: 5.5% on e-books (reduced rate).\n   - **Negotiation tips**: Demand **sales reporting** (monthly, via ONIX/Edistat) and **marketing budget** tied to price. For niche content like yours, propose **subscription models** or **pay-what-you-want** with floors.\n\n#### 6. **Overall Negotiation Power**\n   - **High if exclusive/online-only**: Publishers want content; walk away if terms suck (no sunk costs).\n   - **Standard French contract template**: Insist on reviewing the full *contrat-type* (SGDL/SNE model available online).\n   - **Deadlines**: Negotiate **exclusivity period** (e.g., 2 years) and **reversion rights** if underperforms.\n   - **Weak spots**: If no advance/royalties history, they may lowball. Counter with comps.\n\n### Action Steps\n1. **Demand the draft contract**—review with a pro (SGDL offers free contract checks for members, ~€100/year).\n2. **Gather comps**: Search French ebook stores (Fnac, Decitre) for similar anthologies.\n3. **Propose counter-terms**: E.g., \"Retail price: min. €7.99; royalties 25%; my approval for changes.\"\n4. **Agents**: Contact a French agent (e.g., via Agence Hoffman) for 10-15% commission—they boost terms 20-50%.\n5. **Resources**:\n   - CPI full text: Legifrance.gouv.fr\n   - SGDL: sgdl.org (contract models, advice)\n   - SNE: sne.fr (market data)\n\nYou can likely secure 20-30% royalties and veto power—don't sign without it.
