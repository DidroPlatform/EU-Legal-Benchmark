The candidate answer mentions labelling in Section 2C, stating that labelling (e.g., \\u201cNot for EU\\u201d) is a safeguard for the NI Retail Movement Scheme (part of the Green Lane regime for agri-food), but it does not state that *all* goods going through the green lane must be labelled \\\"Not for EU\\\". The green lane is for goods staying in NI, and the labelling requirement is specifically mentioned in the context of SPS goods (retail movements from GB to NI), not universally for all goods in the Green Lane (UKIMS).
