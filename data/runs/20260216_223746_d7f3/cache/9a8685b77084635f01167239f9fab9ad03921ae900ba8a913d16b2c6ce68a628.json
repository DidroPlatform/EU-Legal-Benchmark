The candidate answer discusses overriding interests under Schedule 3, Paragraph 2 of the LRA 2002, mentioning that a person in actual occupation may have such an interest. It then notes that the claimant was arguably not in actual occupation due to absence. However, it does not explicitly state the legal principle that the overriding interest binds the disponee *unless* the disponee did not know of the right or the occupation was not obvious on a reasonably careful inspection (which is the core of the LRA 2002 test for binding an unconnected disponee). The answer focuses more on whether the claimant *has* an overriding interest (due to absence) rather than the priority rule concerning the disponee's knowledge.\", \"criterion_id\": \"5dbbdbeb-85eb-4ebc-a131-a23734b72631\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1326, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 1560}, "latency_s": 1.0281173329858575, "request_id": "p0eUaaCOBYDXvdIPm5KRmQE", "raw_response": null}
