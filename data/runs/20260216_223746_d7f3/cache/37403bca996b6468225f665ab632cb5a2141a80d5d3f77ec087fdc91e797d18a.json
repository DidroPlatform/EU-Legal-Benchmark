A contract suffering from a fundamental error is voidable by the party that was acting under error.**\n- This is generally CORRECT. In most legal systems, including Swiss law, a fundamental error (essential mistake) makes a contract voidable at the option of the mistaken party.\n\n**ii. The \"Digest\" (or \"Pandects\") has had a marginal impact on the Western legal tradition, compared to that of the so-called Justinian Code.**\n- This is INCORRECT. The Digest/Pandects is actually one of the most important parts of Justinian's compilation and has had enormous influence on Western legal tradition, not marginal. It contains the writings of classical Roman jurists and is fundamental to civil law systems.\n\n**iii. In Switzerland's direct democracy, education is considered a key element for the regeneration of cultural resources. In this sense, the Swiss constitution provides for an extensive public education.**\n- This is CORRECT. The Swiss Constitution does provide for public education as an important element.\n\n**iv. It is a Swiss particularity that all major political parties are represented in the Federal Council. To this effect, the so-called magic formula was established (by practice, not based on an explicit provision in the Constitution).**\n- This is CORRECT. The \"magic formula\" is indeed a Swiss practice (not constitutionally mandated) for proportional representation of major parties in the Federal Council.\n\n**v. The testator may attach burdens or conditions to the disposition in his/her last will, the fulfilment of which may be requested by any interested party once the disposition becomes effective.**\n- This is INCORRECT. Typically, not \"any interested party\" can request fulfillment - usually only specific parties with legal standing (beneficiaries, executors, or those specifically designated) can enforce such conditions.\n\nIncorrect statements: **ii and v**\n\n{\"answer\": \"A\", \"reasoning\": \"Statement ii is incorrect because the Digest/Pandects had enormous, not marginal, impact on Western legal tradition. Statement v is incorrect because not 'any interested party' can request fulfillment of testamentary conditions - only parties with proper legal standing can do so.\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 438, "completion_tokens": 491, "total_tokens": 929}, "latency_s": 7.431856874987716, "request_id": "chatcmpl-b5fb2585-b21c-4689-8bbc-5e398b319d3a", "raw_response": null}
