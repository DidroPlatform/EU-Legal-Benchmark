Both models likely same HS code (refrigerant irrelevant)\n2. Both manufactured same facility = same origin determination\n3. Single commercial invoice = single transaction\n4. Lower cost, faster clearance\n\n**Documentation package (prepare NOW):**\n\n```\nMASTER ORIGIN FILE (one per model)\n├── Bill of Materials (BOM) with origin of each component\n├── Manufacturing process flow chart\n├── Supplier declarations (for EU/UK inputs)\n├── Value-added calculation worksheet\n├── Factory inspection certificate (if available)\n└── Engineer's statement on substantial transformation\n```\n\n**For the customs declaration:**\n- Single entry, two line items (70 Lyon, 30 Alpine)\n- Each line item has its own origin declaration\n- Both claim \"FR\" origin (assuming both qualify)\n- Attach master origin file for both models\n\n---\n\n## ORIGIN SUBSTANTIATION FRAMEWORK\n\n### UK Rules of Origin (Post-Brexit)\n\n**For wholly obtained goods:** Not applicable (manufactured goods)\n\n**For goods with non-originating materials:**\n\n**Test 1: Tariff Shift Rule (Chapter 84)**\n- Change in HS classification from inputs to finished product\n- Example: Chinese compressor (8414.30) → French AC unit (8415.10) = ✅ Origin shift\n\n**Test 2: Value-Added Rule**\n- Typically 45-50% value added in France\n- Calculate: (Ex-works price - Cost of non-originating materials) / Ex-works price\n\n**Test 3: Specific Process Rule**\n- For AC units: Assembly of compressor, heat exchangers, controls, housing\n- If \"substantial transformation\" occurs in France = French origin\n\n### Your Specific Situation:\n\n**Lyon Model (R32):**\n- Compressor: China (assume)\n- Heat exchangers: EU (assume)\n- Controls: EU (assume)\n- Assembly: France\n- **Origin claim:** France (if >45% value-added OR tariff shift achieved)\n\n**Alpine Model (R454B):**\n- **Same analysis** - refrigerant type doesn't change origin determination\n- If same supply chain as Lyon = same origin conclusion\n\n**CRITICAL:** The R454B refrigerant is a **component input**, not a classification determinant. Your forwarder may be confusing:\n- HS classification (what the product IS)\n- Origin determination (where substantial transformation occurred)\n\n---\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE\n\n### Week 1: Legal Structure\n- [ ] Day 1-2: Incorporate UK subsidiary (Companies House online)\n- [ ] Day 3: Apply for UK EORI (online, immediate)\n- [ ] Day 4-5: Register for UK VAT (online, can take 7-10 days)\n- [ ] Day 5-7: Open UK business bank account\n\n### Week 2: Customs Setup\n- [ ] Day 8: Submit BTI applications for both models (HMRC online)\n- [ ] Day 9-10: Prepare master origin files (both models)\n- [ ] Day 11-12: Engage UK customs broker (interview 3, select 1)\n- [ ] Day 13-14: Set up CDS (Customs Declaration Service) access\n\n### Week 3: First Shipment Prep\n- [ ] Day 15: Finalize commercial invoice (UK subsidiary as consignee)\n- [ ] Day 16: Prepare origin declarations (both models)\n- [ ] Day 17: Arrange UK delivery and VAT payment\n- [ ] Day 18-19: Pre-lodge customs entry (before arrival)\n- [ ] Day 20: Goods arrive, clear customs\n- [ ] Day 21: Deliver to US conglomerate retailer\n\n---\n\n## CONTRACTUAL RESTRUCTURE WITH RETAILER\n\n### New Sales Terms (EXW Alternative)\n\n**Problem:** EXW puts ALL risk on buyer, but they're refusing IOR role.\n\n**Solution:** Modify to **DDP (Delivered Duty Paid)** with pass-through pricing:\n\n**New contract structure:**\n```\nPRICE BREAKDOWN:\n- Ex-works price (your manufacturing cost + margin): £X\n- UK import duty (0% under TCA, but show separately): £0\n- UK VAT (20%, but recoverable by retailer): £Y\n- Customs clearance fee: £Z\n- UK delivery: £W\n---\nTOTAL DDP PRICE: £(X+Y+Z+W)\n\nPAYMENT TERMS:\n- Retailer pays DDP price\n- You handle all import formalities via UK subsidiary\n- Retailer reclaims VAT through their UK VAT return\n```\n\n**Advantage:**\n- You control the import process (quality, timing)\n- Retailer gets goods delivered, duty-paid\n- No IOR burden on retailer\n- You can use UK subsidiary as IOR (liability shield)\n\n**Contract clause to add:**\n```\n\"Seller shall act as Importer of Record through its UK subsidiary,\n[UK Sub Ltd]. Title and risk transfer to Buyer upon delivery to\nBuyer's designated UK warehouse. Buyer shall provide Seller with\nits UK VAT number for VAT reclaim purposes.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## VAT MECHANICS\n\n### UK VAT Registration (via UK Subsidiary)\n\n**Registration trigger:**\n- Immediate (you're making taxable supplies in UK)\n\n**VAT accounting:**\n1. **Import VAT** (20% of CIF value):\n   - Paid at import (or use postponed VAT accounting - PVA)\n   - Reclaimed on same VAT return (net = £0 cash impact if using PVA)\n\n2. **Output VAT** (20% of sale price to retailer):\n   - Charged to retailer on invoice\n   - Retailer reclaims (they're VAT registered)\n   - You remit to HMRC quarterly\n\n**Postponed VAT Accounting (PVA) - CRITICAL CASH FLOW TOOL:**\n- Don't pay import VAT upfront\n- Account for it on your VAT return (Box 1 and Box 4)\n- Net effect: £0 cash impact\n- **Requirement:** UK VAT registered + use CDS declaration\n\n**Example:**\n```\nImport value: £100,000\nImport VAT (20%): £20,000\n\nWITHOUT PVA:\n- Pay £20,000 at import\n- Reclaim £20,000 on VAT return (6-8 weeks later)\n- Cash flow hit: £20,000 for 6-8 weeks\n\nWITH PVA:\n- Pay £0 at import\n- Show £20,000 in Box 1 (output tax) and Box 4 (input tax)\n- Net VAT due: £0\n- Cash flow hit: £0\n```\n\n---\n\n## RISK MITIGATION CHECKLIST\n\n### Customs Risk\n- [ ] BTI applications filed (eliminates classification disputes)\n- [ ] Master origin files prepared (substantiates origin claims)\n- [ ] Customs broker with PI insurance engaged (transfers some liability)\n- [ ] UK subsidiary as IOR (shields French parent)\n\n### VAT Risk\n- [ ] UK VAT registration complete (avoids penalties)\n- [ ] PVA election made (eliminates cash flow risk)\n- [ ] Quarterly VAT returns calendared (avoids late filing)\n- [ ] Fiscal rep engaged IF no UK subsidiary (provides guarantee)\n\n### Commercial Risk\n- [ ] DDP pricing agreed with retailer (you control import)\n- [ ] Payment terms protect you (e.g., LC or advance payment for first orders)\n- [ ] Title/risk transfer point clear (delivery to their warehouse)\n- [ ] Force majeure clause (customs delays, regulatory changes)\n\n### Corporate Risk\n- [ ] UK subsidiary adequately capitalized (shows substance)\n- [ ] Directors appointed (UK resident preferred, not required)\n- [ ] Insurance in place (PI, PL, cargo)\n- [ ] Annual accounts/CT600 filing calendared (Companies House compliance)\n\n---\n\n## ANSWER TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS\n\n### 1. \"Do we split the shipment?\"\n\n**NO.** Single entry with two line items.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Both models likely same HS code (refrigerant doesn't change classification)\n- Both have same origin (France, if properly substantiated)\n- Splitting doubles cost with no risk reduction IF origin is solid\n- Only split if BTI reveals different HS codes with different origin rules (unlikely)\n\n### 2. \"How to substantiate unified origin claim?\"\n\n**Prepare master origin file for EACH model** (see documentation package above), then:\n- Single customs entry\n- Two line items (Lyon, Alpine)\n- Each line item references its master origin file\n- Both claim \"FR\" origin\n- Attach both master files to entry\n\n**Key:** Origin is determined per product line, not per shipment. A mixed container doesn't create a \"mixed origin\" problem if each product's origin is properly documented.\n\n### 3. \"How to insulate French parent from HMRC liability?\"\n\n**UK subsidiary as IOR** (Option A above).\n\n**Structure:**\n```\nFrench Parent:\n- Manufactures goods\n- Sells to UK subsidiary (export transaction)\n- NO UK VAT registration\n- NO HMRC relationship\n- NO customs declarations\n\nUK Subsidiary:\n- Buys from French parent\n- Imports into UK (IOR)\n- UK VAT registered\n- Files customs declarations\n- Sells to retailer\n- ALL HMRC liability contained here\n```\n\n**If UK subsidiary fails/is sued:**\n- Creditors can only reach UK subsidiary assets\n- French parent protected by corporate veil\n- Worst case: Lose £50k-100k capitalization + inventory in UK\n\n---\n\n## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN (Next 48 Hours)\n\n### TODAY:\n1. **Email retailer:** \"We can accommodate EXW request by restructuring as DDP with pass-through pricing. This protects both parties. Revised quote attached.\"\n\n2. **Call freight forwarder:** \"Please confirm: Are Lyon and Alpine models classified under different HS codes, or same code with different refrigerants? We believe same code. Please provide your classification rationale in writing.\"\n\n3. **Engage UK formation agent:** Incorporate UK subsidiary (use QC Formations, 1st Formations, or Companies House direct)\n\n### TOMORROW:\n4. **Submit BTI applications:** Both models to HMRC (use online form, provide tech specs)\n\n5. **Interview customs brokers:** Get quotes from 3 UK brokers for ongoing clearance services\n\n6. **Start master origin files:** Gather BOMs, supplier declarations, manufacturing process docs\n\n### DAY 3:\n7. **Finalize UK subsidiary:** EORI application, VAT registration application\n\n8. **Draft new sales contract:** DDP terms with pass-through pricing\n\n9. **Confirm shipment hold:** Don't ship until UK subsidiary has EORI + VAT number\n\n---\n\n## COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS\n\n### Option A: UK Subsidiary (Recommended)\n| Item | Cost (Year 1) |\n|------|---------------|\n| Formation | £500 |\n| Registered office | £150 |\n| Accounting/tax | £2,000 |\n| Insurance | £1,500 |\n| Capitalization | £50,000 (asset, not cost) |\n| **Total cash cost** | **£4,150** |\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Complete liability shield\n- Long-term scalability\n- UK market credibility\n- VAT reclaim capability\n- Customs duty deferment eligibility\n\n### Option B: Fiscal Rep (Not Recommended)\n| Item | Cost (Year 1) |\n|------|---------------|\n| Fiscal rep fee | £4,000 |\n| Customs broker (per entry) | £3,600 (24 entries) |\n| **Total** | **£7,600** |\n\n**Drawbacks:**\n- NO liability shield\n- French parent still declarant\n- Higher ongoing costs\n- No UK market presence\n\n**VERDICT:** Option A costs LESS and provides FAR better protection.\n\n---\n\n## FINAL RECOMMENDATION\n\n**Immediate (This Week):**\n1. Form UK subsidiary (£500, 48 hours)\n2. Submit BTI applications (£0, eliminates classification risk)\n3. Prepare master origin files (internal effort, critical for defense)\n\n**Short-term (Weeks 2-3):**\n4. Complete UK subsidiary setup (EORI, VAT, bank account)\n5. Engage UK customs broker\n6.
