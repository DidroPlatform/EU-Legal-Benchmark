It does not explicitly list 'costs to find a new distributor' as a separate category, although this cost could potentially fall under reliance damages or consequential damages. Since the criterion lists three specific items and the response only clearly lists two (lost profits and reliance costs), it does not fully satisfy the specific enumeration required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"2dcdfa11-3be7-4db6-8b9a-b23f1d5b3ff7\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4203, "completion_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 4400}, "latency_s": 0.8399702079768758, "request_id": "RcOUaebBEaGF7M8PzMbuaA", "raw_response": null}
