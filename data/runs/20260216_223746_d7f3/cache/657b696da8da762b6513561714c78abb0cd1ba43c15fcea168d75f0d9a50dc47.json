The candidate answer explicitly argues the opposite: that the drunk driver's actions (swerving while double the limit) *were* grossly negligent and *did* break the chain of causation, thus absolving the truck driver of liability for the serious injury. The candidate concludes D2's causation fails due to D1's gross intervention. Therefore, the specific condition outlined in the criterion (liability shifting to the truck driver if the drunk driver's action was *not* negligent) is not addressed or supported by the analysis provided.\", \"criterion_id\": \"ff67bf61-062a-4cca-acf8-5003202b85d7\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1715, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 1916}, "latency_s": 2.9656132500385866, "request_id": "bjGVafGfEuTQnsEPhvGb-Ag", "raw_response": null}
