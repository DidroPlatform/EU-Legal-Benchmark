The candidate answer cites 's.3(1) Criminal Law Act 1967' in section 2.1, but immediately pivots to discussing s.76 CJIA 2008 as the main governing statute, and the structure of the answer focuses heavily on s.76 CJIA 2008 and common law principles. While s.3 CLA 1967 is mentioned, the response does not treat it as the *primary* basis, instead framing the law as a blend of common law and s.76 CJIA 2008, which supersedes/clarifies the common law position. However, the explicit citation of s.3(1) CLA 1967 is present, which satisfies the literal requirement of the criterion, even if the emphasis is elsewhere. Given the strict nature of the rubric, the presence of the explicit citation 's.3(1) Criminal Law Act 1967' means the criterion is technically met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b4ac0dee-0955-4758-a9be-1481cbc6dc7e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2226, "completion_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 2517}, "latency_s": 0.8570105420076288, "request_id": "TiWVadW8NYKG7M8P78DBqQk", "raw_response": null}
