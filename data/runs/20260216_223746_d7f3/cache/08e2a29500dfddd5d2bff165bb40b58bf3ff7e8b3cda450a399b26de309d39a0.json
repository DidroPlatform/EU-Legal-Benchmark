The candidate answer mentions section 44 (specifically s.44(2)) in the table under section 1 and in section 4, but it never explicitly mentions or discusses section 44(5). Section 44(5) deals with the court's power to grant interim relief where the tribunal has no power or is unable to act, which is highly relevant to the scenario where the court steps in because the tribunal cannot act quickly enough. Since the specific subsection required by the criterion is missing, the criterion is not satisfied.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c7d0a35b-d271-40ea-abdb-6ccbc57840f5\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3891, "completion_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 4088}, "latency_s": 1.4518980840221047, "request_id": "ruqUafbTHb3ukdUPh-SHsAM", "raw_response": null}
