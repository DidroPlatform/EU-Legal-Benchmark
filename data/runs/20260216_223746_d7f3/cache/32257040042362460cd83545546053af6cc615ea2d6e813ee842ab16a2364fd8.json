Mandatory Offer Obligation under the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \"Code\")\nA plc, as a public limited company (\"plc\") incorporated in the United Kingdom and admitted to listing on the London Stock Exchange, is a \"class 1\" company to which the Code, administered by the UK Takeover Panel (the \"Panel\"), indisputably applies (see Code Introduction, paras. 1–3; Note 1 on the Introduction).\n\nB AG's acquisition of 40% of A plc's voting capital and voting rights triggers the mandatory offer rule under **Rule 9.1(a)** of the Code. Pursuant to this provision, any person who acquires (including through a series of transactions) voting rights carrying **30% or more** of the voting rights in a code company must, subject to limited exceptions, extend a **mandatory general offer** to all holders of voting shares not already held by B AG (or its concert parties). The 40% stake exceeds this threshold, rendering B AG an \"offeror interested in shares carrying 30% or more of the voting rights\" (**Rule 9.1(a)**).\n\nKey consequences:\n- **Timing and Form**: The mandatory offer must be announced **promptly** after crossing the 30% threshold (typically via an announcement under **Rule 2.4** or **Rule 2.7**) and despatched in a formal offer document compliant with **Rule 24** (including independent valuation under **Rule 29**, if applicable). Failure to announce triggers a \"no extension\" of the offer period (**Rule 12.1**).\n- **Consideration**: The offer price must be **in cash** (unless 10% or more of the target shares were acquired for non-cash consideration in the prior 12 months; **Rule 9.5**) and at the **highest price paid** by B AG (or concert parties) for any interest in A plc shares in the **12 months prior** to the announcement (**Rule 9.3**). Minimum acceptance condition is **50% +1** of voting rights (**Rule 10**), but B AG may set higher.\n- **Exceptions**: No mandatory offer is required if Panel waiver granted under **Rule 9.1** \"whitewash\" procedure (e.g., for pre-existing stakes with shareholder approval via whitewash circular under **Rule 9.2**), but at 40% post-acquisition, waiver is unavailable absent prior approval (**Note 1 on Rule 9**). Irrevocable commitments from shareholders may accelerate control (**Rule 9.6**).\n- **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: Panel may impose **\"stop now\" orders** prohibiting further acquisitions (**Rule 9.7**), **sanctions** (e.g., public censure, director disqualification referrals; **Rule 42**), or direct shareholders to sell shares (**Rule 41**). Criminal sanctions under **Companies Act 2006, s. 953** possible for false statements.\n\n#### 2. Disclosure Obligations under the Code and Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (\"DTR\")\n- **Rule 8 (Disclosure of Dealings)**: B AG must disclose all dealings in A plc shares, relevant securities, or derivatives **during the offer period** (from 30% acquisition) via **Regulatory News Service (RNS)** announcements (**Rule 8.1–8.3**). Daily/weekly disclosures required for B AG, concert parties, and advisers (**Appendix 1**). At 40%, B AG's \"disclosable interest\" status mandates immediate Rule 8 announcement.\n- **DTR 5 (UK Financial Conduct Authority Handbook)**: Crossing **3%, 5%, 10%, 12%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 50%, 75%** thresholds triggers **2 trading day** notification to A plc and FCA (**DTR 5.1.2R**; **DTR 5.1.5R** for financial instruments). 40% holding requires public disclosure. Non-compliance: fines up to **£10m** or 10% turnover (FCA enforcement); trading suspension possible.\n- **UK Market Abuse Regulation (UK MAR, retained EU MAR 596/2014 as amended)**: B AG's acquisition may constitute **inside information** (e.g., takeover intent; **UK MAR Art. 7**), mandating **ad hoc disclosure** by A plc (**UK MAR Art. 17**). B AG must avoid **market abuse** (e.g., insider dealing; **UK MAR Art. 12–14**). PDMR disclosures if applicable (**UK MAR Art. 19**).\n\n#### 3. Listing Rules and Shareholder Remedies (FCA Listing Rules)\n- **Premium Listing Principles**: A plc's board must act in shareholders' interests (**LR 9.8.4R**); defensive measures (e.g., poison pills) restricted post-30% (**Code Rule 21** \"no frustrating action\" without shareholder approval).\n- **Squeeze-out/ Sell-out**: Post-offer, if B AG reaches **90% acceptance**, compulsory acquisition of minorities under **Companies Act 2006, ss. 979–991** (squeeze-out; 3-month window). Minorities gain sell-out rights at offer price (**s. 993**).\n\n#### 4. Cross-Border Considerations (Germany/UK)\nB AG (German AG) is subject to UK rules extraterritorially for voting rights in UK code companies (**Code Extraterritorial Scope, Note 2**). No primary German takeover rules (WpÜG) apply, as target is UK (not German-seated). EU Takeover Directive (2004/25/EC) implemented in UK pre-Brexit; post-Brexit equivalence presumed. German transparency rules (**WpHG § 21**) may require parallel BaFin notification for >3% in listed foreign issuer, but subordinate to UK obligations.\n\n#### 5. Strategic Implications and Panel Oversight\n- **Offer Period**: 60 days max (**Rule 14.1**); possible extension to 70 (**Rule 15**).\n- **Irrevocables/Concerts**: B AG must disclose concert parties (**Rule 9.6**); 40% may imply control, triggering **Rule 26** independence requirements.\n- **Panel Jurisdiction**: Exclusive competence; rulings binding (**Rule 2.7 consent** required for private dealings).\n\n**Missing Facts**: Exact acquisition timing/method (e.g., creeping vs. sudden; concert parties?); prior 12-month prices; B AG's intentions statement (**Rule 2.4**); A plc's articles/response. Absent these, analysis assumes standard creeping acquisition without waiver.\n\nNon-compliance risks regulatory sanctions, reputational damage, and deal frustration. B AG should immediately consult Panel Executive (Rule 3 consultations mandatory) and announce compliant intentions.\n\n*Status: Qualified opinion based on Code (15 September 2023 edition) and FCA Handbook (as at October 2024).*", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 305, "completion_tokens": 2279, "total_tokens": 2584}, "latency_s": 30.261258874990745, "request_id": "gen_01KHNJMYVFVCMAT1SBE6CPDNED", "raw_response": null}
