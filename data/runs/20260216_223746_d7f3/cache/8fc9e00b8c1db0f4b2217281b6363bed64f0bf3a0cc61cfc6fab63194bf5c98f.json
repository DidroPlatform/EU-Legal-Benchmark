Here are the key steps:\n\n## Legal Documents to Put in Place\n\n**Durable Power of Attorney (Financial)**\n- Explicitly name your youngest daughter as your agent\n- This governs financial decisions if you become incapacitated\n\n**Healthcare Power of Attorney / Healthcare Proxy**\n- Name her as your healthcare decision-maker\n- Be specific that she has **sole** authority\n\n**Living Will / Advance Directive**\n- Spell out your medical wishes in detail\n- The more specific you are, the less room for siblings to argue \"that's not what Mom/Dad would have wanted\"\n\n**A Well-Drafted Will or Trust**\n- A **revocable living trust** is often stronger than a simple will because:\n  - It's harder to contest\n  - It avoids probate (where challenges typically happen)\n  - It takes effect immediately rather than after death\n\n## Additional Protective Steps\n\n- **Include a no-contest (in terrorem) clause** in your will/trust — if someone challenges it and loses, they get nothing\n- **Get a capacity evaluation** from a physician *at the time of signing* — this undercuts future claims you \"weren't in your right mind\"\n- **Document your reasoning** in a letter of intent or memorandum explaining *why* you made these choices\n- **Use an experienced estate planning attorney** — not DIY forms — so everything is properly witnessed and notarized\n- Consider **video recording** the signing to demonstrate lucidity and voluntariness\n- **Communicate your wishes** (or don't) to the older daughters — this is a strategic decision your attorney can advise on\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe most common challenges from disgruntled siblings are:\n- **Undue influence** (\"the youngest manipulated them\")\n- **Lack of capacity** (\"they didn't know what they were signing\")\n- **Improper execution** (technical flaws in documents)\n\nEvery step above is designed to **preemptively defeat** those arguments.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n**Hire an estate planning attorney experienced in contested estates** — not just any general practitioner. Tell them explicitly that you anticipate challenges from the older children. They will know how to build a \"bulletproof\" package.\n\nWould you like guidance on any specific aspect of this?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 79, "completion_tokens": 558, "total_tokens": 637}, "latency_s": 14.08675674998085, "request_id": "chatcmpl-523370a2-9394-4322-bd49-10033b7cabfa", "raw_response": null}
