It was introduced by **Law No. 6 of January 9, 2004**, which amended the Civil Code (Articles 404–413).\n\n---\n\n## Who Can Be Placed Under This Protection\n\nThe measure applies to any person who, due to **infirmity or physical or mental impairment**, even partial or temporary, is unable to manage some or all of their own interests. This is deliberately broader and more flexible than full interdiction (*interdizione*) or incapacitation (*inabilitazione*).\n\n## How the Process Begins\n\n### Who Can File the Request (*ricorso*)\n\n- The person themselves (the *beneficiario*)\n- A spouse, partner in a civil union, or cohabitant (*convivente di fatto*)\n- Relatives within the fourth degree\n- Relatives by marriage (*affini*) within the second degree\n- The *tutore* or *curatore* if one already exists\n- The Public Prosecutor (*Pubblico Ministero*)\n- Healthcare and social services that are directly involved in the person's care\n\n### Where to File\n\nThe request is filed with the **Giudice Tutelare** (Guardianship Judge) at the *Tribunale* (court) of the place where the person habitually resides.\n\n---\n\n## Documents Typically Needed\n\nThe exact requirements can vary slightly by court, but generally your friend should prepare:\n\n### Core Documents\n- **Ricorso** (formal petition) — describing the person's condition, the specific needs, and why the measure is necessary\n- **Medical documentation** — certificates from the treating physician or specialist describing the nature and extent of the impairment (cognitive decline, diagnosis of dementia, etc.)\n- A **certificate of residence** (*certificato di residenza*) of the beneficiary\n- **State of family** (*stato di famiglia*) of the beneficiary\n- **Identity documents** of both the proposed guardian (*amministratore di sostegno*) and the beneficiary\n- **Fiscal code** (*codice fiscale*) of both parties\n\n### Often Requested Additionally\n- A description of the **beneficiary's assets and income** (property, pensions, bank accounts) — this helps the judge define the scope of the guardian's powers\n- Information about the **family situation** — whether other relatives exist, whether there are conflicts, etc.\n- Any **prior expressions of preference** by the beneficiary (the person can, while still capable, designate who they would want as their future *amministratore di sostegno* — this is done through a public act or authenticated private writing, per Art. 408 Civil Code)\n- A proposed **plan** of what the guardian would manage\n\n---\n\n## How the Court Decides\n\n### The Hearing\n\nThe Giudice Tutelare **must personally hear the beneficiary** (Art. 407 c.c.). This is a fundamental safeguard. The judge may visit the person at home or in a care facility if they cannot come to court.\n\n### What the Judge Evaluates\n\n- The **actual needs** of the person — the judge tailors the measure to the specific situation\n- The person's **residual capacity** — what they can still do on their own\n- The **wishes and aspirations** of the beneficiary, to the extent they can be ascertained\n- The **suitability** of the proposed guardian\n- Whether there are **conflicts of interest**\n- The judge may order a **technical medical examination** (*consulenza tecnica d'ufficio*, CTU) if the existing medical documentation is insufficient\n\n### The Decree\n\nThe judge issues a **decree** (*decreto di nomina*) that specifies:\n\n- Who the *amministratore di sostegno* is\n- The **duration** of the appointment (it can be temporary or indefinite, with periodic review)\n- The **specific acts** the guardian can perform on behalf of the beneficiary (*in nome e per conto*)\n- The **specific acts** for which the guardian must merely assist or give consent alongside the beneficiary\n- Acts that the beneficiary **can still perform independently**\n- **Spending limits** and reporting obligations\n- How often the guardian must report to the judge\n\nThis **tailored approach** is the defining feature of the *amministrazione di sostegno* — it's not one-size-fits-all.\n\n---\n\n## Responsibilities of the *Amministratore di Sostegno*\n\n### General Duties\n\n- **Act in the exclusive interest** of the beneficiary, respecting their wishes, aspirations, and needs (Art. 410 c.c.)\n- **Inform the beneficiary** about acts to be performed on their behalf\n- Inform the judge **promptly** if the measure needs to be modified because circumstances have changed\n- **Not exceed** the powers granted by the decree\n\n### Typical Practical Responsibilities\n\nDepending on what the decree specifies, these may include:\n\n- **Financial management** — paying bills, managing the pension, handling bank accounts\n- **Healthcare decisions** — giving informed consent to medical treatments (within the limits set by the decree and respecting the beneficiary's wishes)\n- **Property management** — maintaining real estate, paying taxes\n- **Administrative tasks** — dealing with public agencies, INPS, the *Agenzia delle Entrate*, etc.\n- **Arranging care** — hiring caregivers, managing placement in a *RSA* (care home) if needed\n\n### Reporting and Accountability\n\n- The guardian must submit **periodic reports** (*rendiconti*) to the Giudice Tutelare — typically annually, but the decree specifies the frequency\n- For **extraordinary acts** (selling property, accepting or renouncing an inheritance, taking out loans, etc.), the guardian generally needs **prior authorization** from the judge\n- The guardian can be **removed** by the judge for negligence, abuse, or unsuitability\n\n### What the Guardian Cannot Do\n\n- Acts not included in the decree\n- Acts that create a **conflict of interest** with the beneficiary (in such cases, a *curatore speciale* is appointed)\n- The guardian generally serves **without compensation**, though the judge can authorize a fair allowance (*equo indennizzo*) in appropriate cases\n\n---\n\n## Practical Tips for Your Friend\n\n1. **Consult a lawyer** — while legal representation is not strictly mandatory for filing the *ricorso*, it is highly advisable, especially to draft the petition properly and navigate the hearing\n2. **Gather medical documentation early** — a clear, recent medical report from a neurologist or geriatrician describing the cognitive decline will strengthen the case significantly\n3. **Act before a crisis** — it's better to start the process while the parent can still participate and express preferences\n4. **The process is relatively quick** — compared to *interdizione*, the *amministrazione di sostegno* procedure is simpler and faster, often resolved within a few weeks to a few months depending on the court's workload\n5. **Costs are modest** — there's a fixed court contribution (*contributo unificato*) that is relatively low, plus any lawyer's fees\n\n---\n\n## Important Distinction\n\nThe *amministrazione di sostegno* is **not** the same as *interdizione* (full guardianship) or *inabilitazione* (partial incapacitation). Those are much more restrictive measures that largely strip the person of legal capacity. Italian law and jurisprudence (including Constitutional Court rulings) strongly favor the *amministrazione di sostegno* as the **default and preferred** measure, reserving the others for truly exceptional cases.\n\n---\n\n> **Disclaimer**: This is general informational guidance based on Italian law as commonly applied. Court practices can vary locally, and individual circumstances matter greatly. Your friend should consult with an Italian attorney (*avvocato*) who practices in family or civil law for advice specific to their situation.\n\nWould you like me to go deeper into any particular aspect — for example, healthcare decision-making authority, or what happens if other family members object?", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 70, "completion_tokens": 1841, "total_tokens": 1911}, "latency_s": 40.759250125003746, "request_id": "chatcmpl-6029cab2-890d-4afd-8bb6-01b660d20698", "raw_response": null}
