The candidate answer discusses goods coming from Great Britain to NI being subject to checks if at risk of entering the EU market, and then addresses third-country goods (like China) generally, stating they are subject to the same rules as GB goods and face checks if at risk of entering the EU single market. It does not explicitly state that goods from third countries destined for the EU are subject to the EU tariff rate (i.e., treated as 'red lane' goods upon entry to NI) or explicitly use the 'red lane' terminology in that context. The explanation is too general regarding the tariff/lane distinction for third-country goods flowing onward to the EU.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f57b3384-02c0-47f0-b614-11a03bd257cb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1300, "completion_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 1518}, "latency_s": 0.9311957919853739, "request_id": "GxKVab4B4o7byg-17t6IBQ", "raw_response": null}
