The candidate answer discusses self-defence primarily under Section 76 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, and then mentions Section 3(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 in paragraph 7 and 8, stating it 'is likely to be engaged on the facts of our case'. While it is cited, the structure of the brief focuses heavily on CJIA 2008 and common law principles, and the citation of s.3 CLA 1967 is brief and secondary to the main discussion of the self-defence test (which is primarily governed by s.76 CJIA 2008 and common law in modern practice for general self-defence). However, since the criterion asks only for explicit citation, and it is cited, I must re-evaluate. The citation is present in paragraph 7: \\\"Section 3(1) provides: ...\\\". This satisfies the requirement for explicit citation. Therefore, the grade should be 1.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b4ac0dee-0955-4758-a9be-1481cbc6dc7e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4286, "completion_tokens": 296, "total_tokens": 4582}, "latency_s": 1.0787471249932423, "request_id": "4kmUaaH7H5G6xN8PvKnb-Qw", "raw_response": null}
