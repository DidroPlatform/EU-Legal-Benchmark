The candidate answer states that counterclaims are 'not automatically admissible' and then proceeds to list the tests (consent, connection, applicable law) that *allow* them to be accepted. It does not explicitly state the general rule that they are *usually inadmissible* unless expressly provided for, which is a common starting point in the literature when the treaty is silent. Instead, it focuses on the conditions for admissibility, implying they are generally possible if those conditions are met, rather than usually barred.\", \"criterion_id\": \"191e67ef-7b2a-4b3a-a1e2-fe9e20a8a0b8\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 929, "completion_tokens": 170, "total_tokens": 1099}, "latency_s": 0.8309700840036385, "request_id": "aQ6VaYDJMbPUvdIPgaLC6QU", "raw_response": null}
