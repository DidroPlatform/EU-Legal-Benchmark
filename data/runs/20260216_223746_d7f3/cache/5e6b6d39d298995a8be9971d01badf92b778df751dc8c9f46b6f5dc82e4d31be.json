Here's a structured approach to help you make an informed decision:\n\n1. **Assess the Strength of the Tax Authority's Case:**\n   - Evaluate how strong the tax authority's case is against your client. If their case is strong, cooperation might be more favorable.\n\n2. **Negotiate the Terms of the Admission:**\n   - Attempt to negotiate with the tax authorities to minimize the scope of the admission. For example, admit to the presence of red flags without admitting to knowingly ignoring them for cost savings.\n\n3. **Consult with Legal Experts:**\n   - Seek advice from legal experts on both the tax and civil sides to understand the potential impacts of each option on the civil lawsuits.\n\n4. **Evaluate Financial Position:**\n   - Consider the hospital's financial position.
