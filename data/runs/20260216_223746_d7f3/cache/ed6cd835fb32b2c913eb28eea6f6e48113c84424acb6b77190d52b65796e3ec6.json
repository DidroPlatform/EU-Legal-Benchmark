The candidate answer focuses almost entirely on provisions within the Shareholders' Agreement (SHA) and only briefly mentions German law nuances (e.g., Drag-along must be explicitly stated in the SHA, ROFR/ROFO must be contractual). It fails to explicitly state the critical legal requirement that certain shareholder rights (like transfer restrictions or specific economic rights) must be formalized in the *Satzung* (Articles of Association) to be fully effective or enforceable against third parties or the company itself, which is a core distinction in German corporate law (GmbHG).\", \"criterion_id\": \"f462ad42-2453-401c-bc17-67772f6a802f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3478, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 3692}, "latency_s": 0.8839273329940625, "request_id": "9PuUad3ZAbyK7M8Ph5iNuAM", "raw_response": null}
