The candidate answer states that if the driver is within the 12-month residency period, they 'should be able to drive without being arrested.' This is conditional and suggests a possibility of arrest if the conditions are not met or if the rules are different. Furthermore, the context implies the user failed a UK practical test, which usually means they cannot drive unsupervised even with an international license, unless they are a new resident within the grace period. The answer does not definitively state 'will not be arrested' under the implied scenario (failed UK test, driving home alone). It provides conditional advice based on residency status, which doesn't directly confirm the 'will not be arrested' statement required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f2288b82-d1dc-4118-bd2b-c7b781210d1e\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 703, "completion_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 918}, "latency_s": 0.9222977919853292, "request_id": "OgWVaa7aN9qfnsEPxvyNyAM", "raw_response": null}
