II(3)) and German arbitration law (ZPO \\u00a7 1032). It also correctly notes that the English courts (as the seat) have jurisdiction to restrain foreign proceedings that breach an arbitration agreement, referencing relevant case law. This directly addresses the criterion regarding the requirement for courts to stay/dismiss actions when an arbitration agreement exists, referencing both the NY Convention and the relevant domestic statute (English Arbitration Act section 9 is implicitly covered by the discussion of English court power over the seat).\", \"criterion_id\": \"9a18bff1-0b8a-437e-b610-22df6d1367a6\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3883, "completion_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 4067}, "latency_s": 0.9184863329865038, "request_id": "af-UaYfsMPKcnsEPtfCWuQg", "raw_response": null}
