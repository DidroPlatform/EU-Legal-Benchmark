It does not address the initial scenario where a New York court might be asked to *enjoin* (stay or prohibit) the Paris arbitration proceeding itself, which is what the criterion is about (i.e., the circumstances under which NY courts would intervene to stop the arbitration *before* the award is rendered).\", \"criterion_id\": \"f24c358a-43a3-47ef-b32c-ce86625942a9\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2653, "completion_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 2848}, "latency_s": 0.8674277079990134, "request_id": "8-qUacDBOKeN7M8Pq5OaoQ8", "raw_response": null}
