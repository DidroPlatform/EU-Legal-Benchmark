The candidate answer proposes a DDP structure where a UK subsidiary acts as the IOR, which structurally insulates the French parent. However, it does not include any contractual clause that specifically caps the French company's liability to the IOR (which would be the UK subsidiary in this structure) at the value of a security deposit. The proposed contract clause focuses on title transfer and VAT handling, not liability capping related to a security deposit.\", \"criterion_id\": \"49d7071d-f6c2-480a-9e08-bbf2ae6219a1\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4370, "completion_tokens": 169, "total_tokens": 4539}, "latency_s": 1.4754455829970539, "request_id": "WsuUaczEDvCMkdUPpaWNwAE", "raw_response": null}
