The candidate answer does not suggest unilateral removal. Instead, it discusses complex legal concepts like priority, actual occupation, overriding interests, optional/obligatory advances, and suggests seeking legal advice and evidence gathering (SARs, registering a restriction) to challenge the priority in court or negotiate. It explicitly states that priority depends on notice, occupation, and registration protections, implying a formal legal process is required, not unilateral action.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d27ab34b-28c5-4b3d-a386-1a9c61ed0523\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2479, "completion_tokens": 167, "total_tokens": 2646}, "latency_s": 1.064936792012304, "request_id": "CBmVaYvbM4KVxN8Pts2XoAo", "raw_response": null}
