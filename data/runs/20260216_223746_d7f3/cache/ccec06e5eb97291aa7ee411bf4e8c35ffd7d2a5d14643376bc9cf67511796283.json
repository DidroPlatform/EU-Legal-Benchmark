The candidate answer analyzes the chair as an 'act of nature' that does not break the chain of causation, focusing on the foreseeability of the *swerving* action itself, rather than the visibility of the chair as a factor in assessing the driver's response (B's action) as a potential intervening cause or assessing B's negligence based on what a reasonable person would have done upon seeing the chair. The analysis does not explicitly link the conspicuousness of the chair to the legal determination of whether B's swerve was an intervening cause or an unreasonable response.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d2abf342-9ee3-4014-82e6-c59502d6c44a\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3219, "completion_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 3441}, "latency_s": 1.388316707976628, "request_id": "vu-UaeDKFqvgnsEP8Mu7uAM", "raw_response": null}
