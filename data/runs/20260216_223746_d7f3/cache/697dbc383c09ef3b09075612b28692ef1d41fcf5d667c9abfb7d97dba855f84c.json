The candidate answer discusses the drunk driver's liability extensively, noting that the intoxication is 'not an intervening act but part of their culpability' and that the drunk driver bears primary liability. It does not address the truck driver's defense or how the drunk driver's intoxication specifically serves as evidence for the truck driver to argue the chain of causation was broken by an unreasonable intervening act. The analysis focuses on the drunk driver being the primary liable party, not on how the truck driver might use the intoxication as a defense.\", \"criterion_id\": \"b3573ee1-8fb6-4d07-8572-3a1e1a5480e2\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1136, "completion_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 1334}, "latency_s": 1.0094584159669466, "request_id": "zuCUad37OZe4xN8PoZ_BiQQ", "raw_response": null}
