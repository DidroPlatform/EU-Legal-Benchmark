However, it fails to explicitly define predefined escalation/remediation triggers and timelines for *every* control point as required by the criterion. While Control 8 addresses 'Exception Management & Escalation' with MTTR targets, and the 'Bottom Line' mentions escalation paths, the specific requirement is that this detail must be present *for every control point* alongside its KPI and tolerance.
