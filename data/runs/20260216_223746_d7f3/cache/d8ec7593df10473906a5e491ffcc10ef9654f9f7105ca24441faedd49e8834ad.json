The candidate answer discusses cost recharging between the UK subsidiary and the Italian parent company (Section 1.A, Section 2, Option 2), mentioning potential VAT/reverse charge issues and the need to structure recharging as a tax-exempt service (e.g., under EU cost-sharing rules). However, it fails to explicitly name or define the 'arm's length principle' or the OECD transfer pricing rules that govern whether the recharged costs are acceptable for tax purposes between related entities. It only touches upon the practical implications of cost allocation without stating the underlying principle required by the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d4be5c2e-89e3-4ab5-bb40-67b256078b26\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3274, "completion_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 3487}, "latency_s": 1.114206500002183, "request_id": "pPiUaej9HPT77M8Prpvt6Ag", "raw_response": null}
