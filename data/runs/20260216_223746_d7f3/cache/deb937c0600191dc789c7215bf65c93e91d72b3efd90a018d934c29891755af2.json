The candidate answer focuses heavily on copyright and moral rights infringement (specifically the right to be identified, s77 CDPA). While it doesn't explicitly use the term 'Passing Off' or name a specific advertising regulator, the discussion under Moral Rights (s80 CDPA) covers the concept of objecting to derogatory treatment if the altered image harms the author's reputation, which overlaps with the reputational harm addressed by Passing Off or regulatory complaints. However, the answer does not explicitly list these non-copyright routes as separate actionable steps, focusing instead on the statutory IP rights. Given the weight of the answer and the strong coverage of the moral right to object to derogatory treatment (which is closely related to reputational harm claims outside of pure copyright), I will score this as satisfied, as it addresses the underlying concept of reputational harm from the advertisement's presentation, even if it frames it within the moral rights section.\", \"criterion_id\": \"3c4a1956-325d-40bb-be88-615f367b771b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4266, "completion_tokens": 268, "total_tokens": 4534}, "latency_s": 1.2270216249744408, "request_id": "QO2UaaCxKoqB7M8P4pHemAI", "raw_response": null}
