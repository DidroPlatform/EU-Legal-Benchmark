The candidate answer discusses the difference between 'Dirigente' and other employee categories in Italy, noting that 'Dirigente' status leads to higher social security costs and stronger dismissal protection. It suggests avoiding the 'Dirigente' classification if possible, but it does not explicitly mention the risk of a *labor-law lawsuit* arising from the *wrongful* classification (i.e., classifying a Dirigente as a Quadro or vice versa). The discussion is focused on cost and legal protection, not the specific litigation risk associated with misclassification.\", \"criterion_id\": \"05dcf770-c816-440d-abf5-4b4e9ed030fb\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2422, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 2622}, "latency_s": 0.8349816250265576, "request_id": "wCaVabvqNanw7M8Pu5DvyAM", "raw_response": null}
