In practice, this means third-country goods arriving directly in NI face EU-rate tariffs and full customs controls at the point of entry.\\\" It mentions that the trader can seek reimbursement if the UK tariff is lower, but the initial imposition is at the EU rate, not the UK rate, and the presumption is not that they are subject only to the UK tariff upon proof of destination.
