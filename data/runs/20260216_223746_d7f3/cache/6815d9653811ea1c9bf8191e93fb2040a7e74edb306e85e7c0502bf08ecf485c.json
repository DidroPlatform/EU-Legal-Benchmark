The candidate answer discusses urgency (Step 1 of the balancing test) and suggests that if the tribunal can act quickly, the court will stay its order (Section 2.3, Section 3, Step 2). However, it does not explicitly state the legal requirement that permission from the tribunal/emergency arbitrator/parties is needed *if the case is not one of urgency* as a prerequisite for the court to act, which is a specific legal threshold often derived from statutory provisions or established case law regarding court support for arbitration when the tribunal is already functional. The answer focuses more on the balancing test (urgency vs. tribunal action) rather than the specific permission requirement mentioned in the criterion.\", \"criterion_id\": \"f1109ec9-915b-49cf-8602-e1a2f2a99b4b\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3910, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 4144}, "latency_s": 1.2717871670029126, "request_id": "n-qUac6aE9fu7M8Pk_6wkAU", "raw_response": null}
