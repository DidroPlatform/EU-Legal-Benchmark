The candidate answer does not explicitly state that the owner's blame would be equal to the neighbour's *if* the report had mentioned electrical maintenance. Instead, it correctly identifies that the owner (as RP) has a high degree of liability due to ownership and the failure of the FRA to cover the specific risk, leading to a conclusion of secondary/joint liability, while the neighbour has primary liability for the direct breach (EAWR).
