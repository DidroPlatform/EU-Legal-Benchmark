The candidate answer discusses the FRA provider's omission in Section 3, noting that outsourcing does not outsource legal responsibility and that the RP remains responsible for ensuring the FRA is sufficient. It mentions that if the assessor failed to flag obvious controls, it might support a civil claim against them, but it does not explicitly state the condition required by the rubric: that the assessor would *not* be to blame *if* the report mentioned the maintenance responsibility. In fact, the response implies the RP still holds the primary duty regardless of the report's contents regarding maintenance.\", \"criterion_id\": \"c3f440bd-74b7-4346-bb37-641760e3aa9f\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3178, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 3378}, "latency_s": 0.9925646669580601, "request_id": "8xqVabazOKzu7M8P7_W9-AQ", "raw_response": null}
