The candidate answer discusses damages under Delaware law (Section 5.2), noting that USCo can argue reputational loss is too remote or not caused by the breach, and that USCo must demonstrate mitigation. It also mentions the need for financial analysis of alleged loss of reputation. However, it does not explicitly state or analyze that the *German distributor* faces a *high burden of proof threshold* specifically regarding proving the *damages* themselves (beyond proving the breach). The analysis focuses more on the breach (materiality, cure) and the scope of damages (remoteness, mitigation) rather than the difficulty of meeting a high threshold for proving the quantum of damages.\", \"criterion_id\": \"d00808cb-d679-4896-825b-ae9319778964\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4292, "completion_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 4511}, "latency_s": 1.5426510829711333, "request_id": "MfCUaaGgG9qfnsEPxvyNyAM", "raw_response": null}
