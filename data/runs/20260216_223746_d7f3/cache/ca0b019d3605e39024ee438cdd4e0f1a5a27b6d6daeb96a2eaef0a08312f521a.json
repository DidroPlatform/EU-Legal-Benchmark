(ii) The BGer clarified that agreements falling under the presumption provisions of Art. 5 Abs. 3/4 KG are considered significant (erheblich) even when the presumption of elimination of effective competition is rebutted - correct. (vi) Direct sanctions can be imposed even when an agreement falls under a presumption provision but the presumption of elimination of effective competition can be rebutted - correct. (vii) Agreements subject to the presumption provisions are per se considered significant - correct. Regarding the other statements: (iii) The case concerned a vertical territorial restriction (absolute territorial protection for Elmex), not resale price maintenance (Preisbindung zweiter Hand) - incorrect. (iv) The court did not rule that efficiency justifications are impossible for presumption agreements - incorrect. (v) The case concerned Art. 5 Abs. 4 KG (vertical agreements), not Abs. 3 - this is debatable but the main focus was Abs. 4. (viii) The court held sanctions can apply even without actual elimination of competition - incorrect. (ix) The court found Art. 5 KG meets ECHR Art. 7 requirements - incorrect (the opposite was held).\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1205, "completion_tokens": 329, "total_tokens": 1534}, "latency_s": 10.32648975000484, "request_id": "chatcmpl-482f2a35-0b03-4634-b4c4-c6f7f33214f6", "raw_response": null}
