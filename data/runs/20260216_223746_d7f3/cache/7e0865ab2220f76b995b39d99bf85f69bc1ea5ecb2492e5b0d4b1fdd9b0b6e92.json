While it mentions the GP acting as a 'puppet' due to UK-based decisions, it does not explicitly frame the core analysis as the dependency test (dependent vs. independent agent/entity) as the central hinge for the PE risk determination, which is what the criterion requires.\", \"criterion_id\": \"9ad55205-01bc-44d8-bad8-3d2dc33f8002\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1075, "completion_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 1265}, "latency_s": 0.9375067919609137, "request_id": "XyOVaYbJLryK7M8Ph5iNuAM", "raw_response": null}
