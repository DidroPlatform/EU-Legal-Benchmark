It also lists the 'Windsor Framework Agreement (27 Feb 2023)' and the 'UK Command Paper on the WF (Feb 2023)' as primary sources. While the candidate states 'formally adopted in February 2023' instead of the specific March 22, 2023, date mentioned in the criterion's context (which refers to the date of UK Parliamentary approval/adoption of the legal text), it clearly identifies the WF as the agreement negotiated to ease the Protocol's burden and provides relevant primary source documentation surrounding its adoption in early 2023. The core requirement—identifying the WF as the negotiated solution to the Protocol burden—is met.\", \"criterion_id\": \"dad0e919-f700-46a6-aa9a-2b1456a237f3\"}", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2988, "completion_tokens": 266, "total_tokens": 3254}, "latency_s": 1.5174964999896474, "request_id": "UQGVaZfqOMPPnsEPpfqayAc", "raw_response": null}
