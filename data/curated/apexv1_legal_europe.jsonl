{"Task ID":1382,"Domain":"Legal","Prompt":"Belgium and Spain are both Contracting Parties to the attached “Convention on Conduct of Fishing Operations in the North Atlantic” (the “Convention”). Authorized officers from Belgium, upon seeing that lines anchored into the sea were not marked, identified and approached a Spanish vessel in order to request information about the vessel. The Spanish officers on board refused to cooperate with the Belgian officers. The Belgian officers then reported the Spanish vessel to a review board and argued that by refusing to cooperate, the Spanish officers on board further violated Spain's obligations under the Convention. Considering the attached document, draft an advisory email to Spain, explaining what the review board will likely decide.
