This case revolves around her confinement in psychiatric institutions between July 2005 and January 2006, involving admissions to Idrija and Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospitals. Her involuntary confinement began following a police report to her family physician after she broke into a house, leading to an admission under a consent form which she later contested. Diagnosed with schizophrenia and medicated, she questioned her treatment's duration. Legal proceedings regarding her confinement were initiated, with hearings on July 15, 2005, and various legal challenges by the applicant and her representatives, including constitutional complaints about the legality and process of her confinement without a formal judicial decision. During her stay, she expressed discomfort with her treatment and confinement, claiming they were against her will. Outcomes included her transfer to an open ward and eventual discharge, while she continued legal actions contesting her confinement's legality. Despite interventions by various courts addressing procedural issues and her rights, her complaints were eventually dismissed as unfounded or filed out of time by the Constitutional Court.\nArguments: Furthermore, as regards the possibility for the applicant to claim compensation following the adoption of this judgment, it does not appear from the relevant legislation that she would have a remedy available to her to this effect. Moreover, the Government have not submitted any arguments to the contrary.\nThere has therefore been a violation of Article 5 § 5 of the Convention with regard to the applicant’s confinement in both the Idrija and Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospitals.\nThe applicant complained that in both periods of her confinement, she had been subjected to treatment with powerful antipsychotic drugs to which she had not consented and which she was unable to challenge in breach of Articles 3, 8, 9, 10 and 13 of the Convention. Moreover, she complained about the fact that her father had been involved in her treatment without her consent.\nContinuation options:\nA: The Court observes that the applicant’s requests for information concerned exclusively the question whether or not he had been subjected to secret surveillance. In those circumstances, the Court considers that his complaint in respect of the refusals to provide him such information falls to be examined as an aspect of his broader grievance concerning the lack of sufficient safeguards against unjustified interferences with his rights under Article 8 of the Convention. Article 8 provides, in so far as relevant:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life ... and his correspondence.\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”\nB: The Court considers that, having regard to the circumstances of the present case, her complaint falls to be examined under Article 8 of the Convention (see X v.

In the present case, it considers that the applicant’s complaint concerns exclusively the remedies available to her against her stepfather, not those available against the State to enforce the substance of a Convention right or freedom at the national level. The complaint is therefore to be examined under Article 8 of the Convention alone, which provides as follows:\n“1.

The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Ljubljana. She has suffered from a psychotic disorder for a number of years and has been admitted to psychiatric hospitals for treatment several times since 2000. The present case concerns two consecutive periods of confinement in such hospitals between July 2005 and January 2006.', '6.  On 10 July 2005 the applicant’s family physician received a telephone call from the local police informing him that the applicant had broken into an unoccupied house, apparently with the intention of sleeping there, and that they were having trouble communicating with her. He referred her to the Idrija Psychiatric Hospital, a public healthcare institution, indicating that she was disturbing the environment and behaving psychotically.', '7.  On the same day the applicant was admitted to the closed ward of the Idrija Psychiatric Hospital. On admission, she signed a consent form for confinement and psychiatric treatment. In her exchange with the hospital staff, the applicant said that she was “possessed by energetic and physical people sent to her through the lens of cameras operated by President Bush”. The psychiatrists treating her diagnosed her with schizophrenia and noted that she exhibited “delusional interpretations and perceptual anomalies as well as features of depersonalisation and derealisation”. The applicant was started on medication consisting of 10 mg of Moditen three times a day, three Akineton tablets a day, 5 mg of Apaurin three times a day, and an ampoule each of Haldol and Akineton a day. No mention was made in her medical records of her having refused to take any medication.', '8.  On 11 July 2005 the applicant started to ask how long she would have to stay in the hospital and told the psychiatrists that she would resist. The hospital notified the Idrija Local Court of her confinement, indicating the reasons given by the family physician for referring her to the hospital.', '9.  On 13 July 2005 the Idrija Local Court appointed a lawyer, I.R.P., to represent the applicant in proceedings it had commenced in her respect. It also scheduled a confinement hearing for 15 July. A notification of the hearing, addressed to the applicant, was sent to the hospital; however, it is not clear when or whether it was received by the applicant.', '10.  On 15 July 2005 a hearing was held regarding the applicant’s confinement. The applicant and one of the psychiatrists treating her were heard. The psychiatrist stated that the applicant had apparently been living in a garage and had broken into a house, and that she had been found wandering around and had been psychotic and uncontrollable. The applicant stated that she would rather be at home, that she did not understand why she had been taken to the hospital, but that other people she named, including a former politician, might have more of an idea. She provided an account of the events which had taken place prior to her confinement, in which she made no mention of having broken into a house. She also stated that she missed her father, and that she had been taking medication while at home.', '11.  In the weeks that followed, the applicant continued her treatment and, according to the medical records, also continued to agree to therapy. On 4 August 2005 the Haldol was replaced with Leponex and the dosage of Apaurin was reduced to 5 mg a day. Eventually, the applicant was taken off the Apaurin altogether.', '12.  Meanwhile, on 30 July 2005 the applicant gave D.P., a lawyer from Ljubljana, power of attorney. She told the representative that she was receiving treatment against her will, but was afraid to refuse it for fear that medication would be administered to her by force.', '13.  On 2 August 2005 the applicant’s representative D.P. notified the hospital that the applicant did not consent to her medical treatment and requested the Idrija Psychiatric Hospital to inform the applicant of her treatment and its side effects. She also pointed out that the applicant had the right to express her own free will and to refuse the treatment if she so wished.', '14.  On 5 August 2005 the applicant, through her representative D.P., lodged a constitutional complaint against the “material act” of her involuntary confinement and an application for a review of the constitutionality of section 49 of the Health Services Act, and of sections 70 to 81 of the Non-Contentious Civil Procedure Act. She alleged, inter alia, that she was unable to effectively enforce her right to judicial review in the involuntary confinement proceedings, as no formal decision had been rendered until that time. She therefore argued that the Constitutional Court should examine the alleged violations of her human rights committed through the “material act” of her confinement, as any other interpretation would constitute a breach of her right to judicial review within the meaning of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention. In addition, she requested that the disputed legislation be repealed with immediate effect, and that she be released from the hospital pending a decision on her confinement.', '15.  On 6 August 2005 D.P. wrote to the hospital again, asking it to stop forcibly administering medication to the applicant.', '16.  On 8 August 2005 the applicant was transferred from the closed to the open ward of the Idrija Psychiatric Hospital. On the same date the Idrija Local Court was informed of the applicant’s transfer and terminated the proceedings regarding her confinement.', '17.  On 12 August 2005 the applicant was discharged from the Idrija Psychiatric Hospital at her own request. In this regard, it was noted by her psychiatrists that she no longer exhibited any manifestly psychotic symptoms, but that she should continue medical treatment to prevent herself from having a psychotic relapse with violent outbursts. The final diagnosis listed in the applicant’s medical records was disorganised (hebephrenic) schizophrenia.', '18.  On 15 September 2005 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s constitutional complaint of 5 August 2005 against her involuntary confinement in the Idrija Psychiatric Hospital for failure to exhaust the available remedies. It also rejected a further constitutional complaint she had lodged on 21 August 2005 relating to her confinement in the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital on the same grounds (see paragraph 19 below). It found that these complaints had been lodged even before the first-instance decisions on the involuntary confinement were rendered. As regards the applicant’s application for a review of the provisions of the Non-Contentious Civil Procedure Act, the Constitutional Court reiterated its findings in an earlier decision (no. U-I-60\/03) that the thirty-day time-limit for issuing a court order for confinement could be too long (see paragraph 64 below). However, it was not possible to repeal the disputed legislation with immediate effect, as that would leave a sizeable gap in the legal system, so the application was dismissed.', '19.  On 15 August 2005 the applicant was taken to the emergency medical services by the police. On arrival, she stated that she was being “raped by the police, the emergency medical technicians, everybody”. The emergency physician referred her to the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital, a public healthcare institution, where she was taken by ambulance. It was noted in her admission record that her speech was dissociated and that she exhibited signs of paranoia and megalomaniac delusions. Under the heading “the degree of the patient’s rejection of hospitalisation” the emergency psychiatrist circled the statement that the applicant “accepted hospitalisation owing to the situation (the staff being present)”. Under the heading “the need to use compulsory measures on patients rejecting hospitalisation” the psychiatrist circled the statement “negative attitude, no compulsory measures necessary”. It is evident from the applicant’s medical records that during the first days of her admission, she was restless, talkative and unable to follow the activity programme. She spent the first two days of her treatment in the admission ward.', '20.  As of 17 August 2005 the applicant was placed in the closed ward. Based on her medical records, it appears that she remained talkative but found it somewhat difficult to engage in meaningful discussion. She still exhibited delusions of persecution and was convinced that her father had bribed the doctors and the police to keep her in the hospital. She was also convinced that the garage where she had been living was bugged by the CIA. On 19 August 2005 the applicant was visited by her representative D.P.', '21.  The applicant was given thirty drops of Haldol three times daily, three Akineton tablets a day and 2 mg of Lorsilan three times a day. The Haldol was subsequently replaced with 10 mg of Moditen three times a day. In the latter stages of her treatment, the applicant received Lorsilan and 100 mg of Leponex three times a day. Eventually, the applicant was only treated with Leponex. During the treatment she often complained of various physical pains and discomfort, in particular painful muscle spasms and toothache.', '22.  On 21 August 2005 the applicant informed the Ljubljana Local Court of her confinement and lodged an application for an interlocutory order that her medical treatment be discontinued and that she be released from the hospital pending a final decision on the matter. On the same day the applicant also lodged a constitutional complaint against the “material act” of her confinement and an application for a review of the constitutionality of section 49 of the Health Services Act and of sections 70 to 81 of the Non-Contentious Civil Procedure Act. The applicant’s notification of involuntary confinement was received by the local court on 22 August 2005.', '23.  On 23 August 2005 the Ljubljana Local Court appointed a lawyer, P.C., to represent the applicant in the involuntary confinement proceedings. On the same day a hearing was held which took twenty-five minutes. The applicant’s court-appointed representative was present, but, according to the applicant, did not participate actively. At the hearing, the applicant was examined by an expert from another healthcare institution, who immediately upon examination submitted an opinion stating that the applicant’s narrative showed signs of a paranoid delusional system which had probably lasted for a long time and to which she was uncritical. She considered that the applicant needed treatment in a closed ward for up to one month.', '24.  Based on this expert opinion, the Ljubljana Local Court ordered that the applicant be confined in the closed ward of the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital until 23 September 2005.', '25.  On 24 August 2005 the applicant’s application for an interlocutory order was dismissed by the Local Court on the grounds that personality rights could not be protected by injunctive relief.', '26.  On 27 August 2005 the applicant was visited by her court-appointed lawyer P.C., who wanted her to give him the power of attorney. According to the applicant’s medical records, the psychiatrist on duty was informed of the visit and gave his consent for the applicant to sign the document.', '27.  On 2 September 2005 the applicant appealed against the Ljubljana Local Court’s order regarding her continued confinement and the dismissal of her application for an interlocutory order.', '28.  On 3 September 2005 the applicant spoke to the then head of the hospital, complaining that there was no reason for her to remain there. She also stated that she did not understand why she was on medication, although she did confirm that she was taking Akineton as part of her outpatient treatment.', '29.  According to the Government, which relied on her medical records, later that day the applicant was transferred to the open ward of the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital. The applicant, however, maintained that the transfer took place on 4 September 2005. On 6 September 2005 the applicant’s representative D.P. notified the Ljubljana Local Court of the applicant’s transfer.', '30.  During the course of her stay in the open ward of the hospital, on 7 September 2005 the applicant was allowed by her psychiatrist to withdraw some of the money she had received as social assistance. In addition, on 13 September she was permitted to recover her clothes. She was allowed to leave the hospital premises for a few hours several times during her stay, on 20, 23 24, 27 and 28 October, and 9, 11, 13 and 30 November 2005. Her psychiatrists noted that she was disciplined in her outings and always returned to the hospital at the designated time.', '31.  On 9 September 2005 the Ljubljana Higher Court allowed the applicant’s appeal against the Ljubljana Local Court’s decisions of 23 and 24 August 2005 and remitted the case to the first-instance court. The higher court pointed out that the court’s reasoning lacked reference to the decisive factors which would indicate that it was necessary to deprive the applicant of her liberty. As regards the dismissal of the applicant’s application for an interlocutory order, the higher court rejected the lower court’s interpretation that no legal basis existed for an interlocutory order for the protection of the applicant’s personality rights. The court also pointed out that the applicant’s request for her medical treatment to be stopped warranted separate consideration.', '32.  On the same day the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Ljubljana Higher Court’s decision and a request for a procedure to be initiated for the review of the constitutionality of section 49 of the Health Services Act and of sections 70 to 81 of the Non-Contentious Civil Procedure Act. She insisted that remitting her case to the first-instance court without ordering her release from the hospital had violated her right to personal freedom.', '33.  As already stated (see paragraph 18 above), on 15 September 2005 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s constitutional complaints of 5 and 21 August 2005 against both periods of her confinement.', '34.  On 22 September 2005 the applicant lodged a supervisory appeal with the Ministry of Justice regarding the proceedings before the Ljubljana Local Court. On 5 October the Ministry informed the applicant that the local court had set the date of the hearing for 11 October 2005. The summons to the hearing was sent to the applicant’s home address.', '35.  On 7 October 2005 the father of the applicant, I. M., informed the local court that he had been served a summons addressed to the applicant for a hearing scheduled for 11 October 2005. The judge agreed to allow the applicant’s father to attend the scheduled hearing.', '36.  On 10 October 2005 the applicant’s representative D.P. informed the local court that the summons to the hearing of 11 October was unclear as to whether the representative herself had been summoned, or whether the applicant had been summoned by way of her representative. In addition, she proposed that a new summons be served in which the reasons for the hearing be set out.', '37.  The next day the applicant’s court-appointed representative P.C., the applicant’s father I.M. and her chosen representative D.P. were present at the hearing. D.P. proposed that the hearing be rescheduled since the applicant had not been properly summoned. She also informed the local court that the applicant was being held in the open ward of the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital but that the hospital was refusing to release her, or to discontinue her medical treatment. On the same date the local court appointed another expert to give an opinion on the applicant’s condition.', '38.  On 12 October 2005 the Ljubljana Local Court again ruled on the applicant’s application for an interlocutory order concerning the termination of her medical treatment and her immediate release from the psychiatric hospital. Contrary to the reasoning of the Ljubljana Higher Court’s decision of 9 September 2005, the application was again dismissed on the grounds that no legal basis existed for an interlocutory order for the protection of a person’s personality rights. The applicant appealed against this decision.', '39.  On 14 October 2005 the applicant requested that the judge sitting on the case be removed on the grounds, inter alia, that he had refused to adjourn and reschedule the hearing of 11 October despite the fact that she had not been properly summoned. Furthermore, she alleged that the judge had violated her right to privacy by allowing her father to attend the hearing. She also requested that the appointed expert be withdrawn. She further requested the court to decide on her immediate release and to exclude her father from the proceedings. On 26 October 2005 the applicant’s request for the withdrawal of the judge was dismissed.', '40.  On 2 November 2005 the Ljubljana Local Court amended its decision of 12 October 2005 by also including in its operative part the dismissal of the applicant’s application that her father be prevented from participating in the hearing.', '41.  On 10 November 2005 the Ljubljana Higher Court again allowed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 12 October 2005 and remitted the case to the first-instance court. It reiterated that a valid legal basis did exist for an interlocutory order for the applicant’s release from the psychiatric hospital and that her request for her medication to be stopped deserved separate consideration. Moreover, the court took note of information in the case file that the applicant had meanwhile been transferred to the open ward. Accordingly, it pointed out that the rules of non-contentious procedure regarding involuntary confinement only applied to closed wards of psychiatric hospitals. It ordered the lower court to examine the question of whether the conditions for continuing the non-contentious proceedings still applied. Otherwise, the applicant was supposed to apply for injunctive relief against infringement of her personality rights.', '42.  On 14 November 2005 the applicant, through her representative D.P., lodged an appeal against the decision of 2 November 2005 on the dismissal of the application concerning her father’s participation in the hearing. The court-appointed representative P.C. responded to the appeal lodged by D.P., arguing that it should be dismissed. On 21 November 2005 the Ljubljana Higher Court upheld the decision of 2 November 2005.', '43.  On 30 November 2005 the Ljubljana Local Court sent a letter to the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital, requesting information about when the applicant had been transferred to the open ward.', '44.  On 8 December 2005 the local court received a reply from the hospital stating that the applicant had been transferred to the open ward on 3 September 2005.', '45.  On 12 December 2005 the Ljubljana Local Court terminated the proceedings regarding the applicant’s involuntary confinement in the psychiatric hospital because of her transfer to the open ward.', '46.  Meanwhile the applicant renewed contact with her father, who arranged for her to spend some weekends at his home. Arrangements were subsequently made for the applicant to move in with him after her release from the hospital.', '47.  On 12 December 2005 the applicant and her father visited the Sežana Social Work Centre, where the applicant declared that she wished her father to act as her guardian in financial and health matters, and her father declared himself willing to provide her with a home and to assume responsibility for her medical treatment and finances. A record was made of the applicant and her father’s declarations and they were informed that they could address any possible disagreements regarding the arrangement to the centre.', '48.  On 15 December 2005 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s constitutional complaint against the decision of 9 September 2005 and her application for constitutional review (see paragraph 32 above) for lack of legal interest. It observed that the applicant was no longer confined in the closed ward of the psychiatric hospital.', '49.  On 22 December 2005 the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of 12 December, stressing, inter alia, that her transfer to the open ward of the hospital did not change the fact that she was confined there against her will. She also complained about the lack of an effective remedy. Moreover, she pointed out that no decision had been made regarding the necessity of her confinement and that she had not been informed of the grounds on which her continuing confinement was based. She further lodged an application for her court-appointed representative P.C. to be taken off the case for failure to act in her interests.', '50.  On 5 January 2006 the Ljubljana Higher Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It held that, since the applicant had been placed in an open ward, the rules of non-contentious procedure were no longer applicable. The court referred the applicant to the rules of contentious procedure, under which it was possible to apply for injunctive relief against infringement of personality rights.', '51.  On 19 January 2006 the applicant was released from the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital. The diagnosis listed on her release form was paranoid schizophrenia.', '52.  On 23 January 2006 the Ljubljana Local Court rejected the applicant’s application for an interlocutory order owing to the fact that the proceedings on the merits had been terminated.', '53.  On 14 February 2006 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the decision of 5 January 2006. She invoked, inter alia, Article 5 of the Convention, and maintained that the fact that she had been placed in the open ward did not imply that she was held there voluntarily. She alleged that any attempt on her part to leave the hospital, while in the open ward, could result in her being brought back to the hospital by force and placed back in the closed ward, as in practice the transfer to the open ward constituted a privilege enjoyed by compliant patients. In this regard the applicant pointed out, relying on section 49 of the Health Services Act (see paragraph 58 below), that the legal basis for involuntary admission and treatment in a psychiatric hospital did not specify in which ward patients are to be placed. She also pointed out that psychiatric hospitals were not required to notify the competent courts of patients’ possible readmission to the closed ward in cases such as her own, where they had already been transferred to the open ward while the order of confinement was still in effect. In her opinion the provisions on involuntary confinement in a psychiatric hospital and the related procedure were still applicable and she was entitled to obtain a decision on the lawfulness of her earlier confinement.', '54.  On 13 April 2006 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s appeal on points of law on the grounds that the applicant lacked legal interest, since the confinement proceedings had been terminated and she had been released from the hospital.', '55.  On 6 July 2006 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court’s decision to reject her appeal on points of law in connection with the Higher Court’s decision of 5 January 2006 and the Ljubljana Local Court’s decision of 12 December 2005 to terminate the proceedings regarding her involuntary confinement in the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital. She reiterated the complaints made regarding her stay in the open ward of the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital and those relating to the alleged breaches of procedural rules in the confinement proceedings. Further, she pointed out that she was entitled to obtain a decision on the merits with regard to her complaints, having regard to the importance of her constitutionally guaranteed right to personal liberty.', '56.  On 27 February 2008 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court’s decision as unfounded, and rejected her complaint against the Higher Court’s decision on the grounds that it had been lodged out of time. The court pointed out that the lodging of an inadmissible appeal on points of law had not suspended the time-limit for lodging the constitutional complaint.']","facts":"The applicant, born in 1971 and residing in Ljubljana, suffers from a psychotic disorder and has been treated in psychiatric hospitals multiple times since 2000. This case revolves around her confinement in psychiatric institutions between July 2005 and January 2006, involving admissions to Idrija and Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospitals. Her involuntary confinement began following a police report to her family physician after she broke into a house, leading to an admission under a consent form which she later contested. Diagnosed with schizophrenia and medicated, she questioned her treatment's duration. Legal proceedings regarding her confinement were initiated, with hearings on July 15, 2005, and various legal challenges by the applicant and her representatives, including constitutional complaints about the legality and process of her confinement without a formal judicial decision. During her stay, she expressed discomfort with her treatment and confinement, claiming they were against her will. Outcomes included her transfer to an open ward and eventual discharge, while she continued legal actions contesting her confinement's legality. Despite interventions by various courts addressing procedural issues and her rights, her complaints were eventually dismissed as unfounded or filed out of time by the Constitutional Court.","a":"The Court observes that the applicant’s requests for information concerned exclusively the question whether or not he had been subjected to secret surveillance. In those circumstances, the Court considers that his complaint in respect of the refusals to provide him such information falls to be examined as an aspect of his broader grievance concerning the lack of sufficient safeguards against unjustified interferences with his rights under Article 8 of the Convention. Article 8 provides, in so far as relevant:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life ... and his correspondence.\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”","b":"The Court considers that, having regard to the circumstances of the present case, her complaint falls to be examined under Article 8 of the Convention (see X v. Finland, no. 34806\/04, § 230, ECHR 2012 (extracts)), the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life ...\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”","c":"The Court is of the view that it suffices to examine the complaints under Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”","d":"The Court reiterates that it is the master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of a case (see, for instance, Aksu v.

In the present case, it considers that the applicant’s complaint concerns exclusively the remedies available to her against her stepfather, not those available against the State to enforce the substance of a Convention right or freedom at the national level. The complaint is therefore to be examined under Article 8 of the Convention alone, which provides as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2.

They lived with their daughter and the applicant’s parents, who assisted in child-rearing. In 2009, both parents worked abroad for six months, leaving the child with the applicant's parents. After returning, their relationship deteriorated, and V. relocated with their child to Bezdryk without informing the applicant. On discovering the child, the applicant noted bruises and sought medical and police intervention, alleging abuse by V. The police declined to open investigations due to insufficient evidence and lack of corpus delicti, despite testimonies from the child claiming inappropriate behavior by V. and her uncle F.

The applicant was born in 1986 and lives in Sumy.', '6.  The applicant had relations with V., a female student born in 1989. On 24 March 2008 V. gave birth to their daughter. On 29 August 2008 the applicant and V. registered their marriage.', '7.  From the time of the birth of the child the couple and their daughter lived in the applicant’s flat in Sumy. The applicant’s parents lived in the same flat and assisted the parents in bringing up the child.', '8.  In 2009 the applicant and V. were absent from home for six months, as they were working abroad. During their absence the applicant’s parents took care of the child.', '9.  In October 2010 the child was admitted to a child-minding centre in Sumy.', '10.  Between 2010 and 2011 V. worked abroad for six months. During that time the child was taken care of by the applicant and his parents. While working abroad, V. transferred funds to the applicant to support the family.', '11.  Relations between the applicant and V. grew worse and on 20 September 2011, after a quarrel with the applicant, V. took the child and moved from the flat without the agreement or knowledge of the applicant. The applicant was not informed of the place to where V. and the child moved to live.', '12.  On 28 September 2011 the applicant asked the police to establish the whereabouts of the child. He and his parents also conducted their own enquiries.', '13.  As was further established in the course of the domestic proceedings, V. moved to the village of Bezdryk, near Sumy, where she apparently cohabited with her uncle, F. (born in 1967). The applicant’s child was admitted to the child-minding centre located in the same village.', '14.  On 1 December 2011 the applicant found the child at the Bezdryk child-minding centre. According to the applicant, the child’s body bore bruises. He took the child back to his flat in Sumy and the following day submitted her for medical examination.', '15.  On 2 December 2011 a forensic medical expert examined the child and reported a red spot on the chin, measuring 1.5 cm by 0.8 , which – in the expert’s opinion – was “a sign of an earlier abrasion”. The expert also documented two abrasions on the nose, measuring 0.4 cm by 0.3 cm and 0.3 cm by 0.2 cm; a bruise on the back, measuring 2 cm by 1 cm; two bruises on the right shin, measuring 1.8 cm by 1 cm and 1.5 cm by 1 cm; and a red, itchy spot in the abdominal area. The expert stated that the injuries could have been caused by blunt objects three or four days before the examination.', '16.  The applicant asked the police to carry out a criminal investigation in connection with the injuries sustained by his daughter, who had allegedly explained that the injuries had been inflicted by V.', '17.  After her return to Sumy, the child continued to live with the applicant and his parents. V. was given access to the child only in the presence of the applicant or other persons that he trusted.', '18.  On 9 December 2011 the Zarichnyy district police of Sumy refused to open a criminal investigation in respect of the alleged abduction of the child, stating that the facts of the case did not indicate that the crime of child abduction had been committed. It was noted that the couple had not divorced and it had yet to be determined by the court with whom the child should reside.', '19.   On 13 December 2011 the Trostyanetskyy district police of the Sumy Region refused to open a criminal investigation in connection with the child’s injuries, as determined on 1 December 2011, for lack of corpus delicti. According to the police decision, the seriousness of the injuries had not been established; however, if the injuries had been minor, the applicant was free to institute a private prosecution against the person concerned.', '20.  On 28 March and 9 April 2012 the applicant’s mother requested the law-enforcement authorities to institute criminal proceedings against V. and F. under Article 156 § 2 of the Criminal Code. She considered that the child could have been a victim of sexual abuse in the period during which the latter had been living together with V. and F. in the village of Bezdryk. The applicant’s mother submitted that the child had told her personal stories which suggested that V. and F. might have engaged in sexual activities in view of the child and that F. had shown his genitals to the child.', '21.  On 9 April 2012, in the course of a pre-investigation inquiry, the applicant’s daughter was interviewed in the presence of the applicant’s mother. The child explained that during her stay with the mother in the village of Bezdryk she had regularly observed V. and F. naked, embracing and kissing each other and engaging in some “backwards and forwards movements” which she had not been able to understand; F. had taught the child how to kiss in an adult fashion, uncovered his genitals in front of her and asked her to touch his genitals.', '22.  On 14 April, 16 May and 31 October 2012 the Sumy district police, having conducted the pre-investigation inquiries, refused to open criminal proceedings for lack of corpus delicti. Those decisions were quashed as unsubstantiated by the supervising prosecutors, who ordered further measures, such as establishing the whereabouts of F. (who had not been interviewed), identifying and interviewing possible witnesses, inspecting the premises and the yard where the alleged crime could have been committed, and undertaking medical and psychological examinations of the child.', '23.  On 8 November 2012 the Sumy district police once again refused to open criminal proceedings against V. and F. on the grounds that there had been no corpus delicti. In their decision the police referred to the interviews with the applicant’s child, V., and other people. V. denied the allegations. F. could not be interviewed as he had moved abroad. In sum, the Sumy district police concluded that the available material had been insufficient to suggest that any crime had been committed.', '24.  On 8 May 2013 the applicant, relying on the new Code of Criminal Procedure of 2012, requested that an investigation be opened against V. and F. in respect of the alleged child sexual abuse. On the same day the Sumy district police opened a criminal investigation under Article 156 § 2 of the Criminal Code. The applicant was admitted to the proceedings as the representative of his daughter.', '25.  The investigator ordered that measures be undertaken to establish the whereabouts of F. During the investigation V. denied the allegations and submitted that she had been a victim of domestic violence, that she had been threatened and beaten by the applicant, and that this had prompted her to run away with the child on 20 September 2011; she also submitted that she had moved to the village of Bezdryk, where her grandfather lived, and that she had had no sexual relations with F., her uncle. When questioned, the applicant and his mother insisted on the truth of their previous statements. They underwent polygraph examinations which suggested that they had told the truth in their submissions.', '26.  On 3 October 2013 the applicant’s daughter was questioned in the presence of a psychologist and her grandmother (the applicant’s mother). The applicant’s daughter submitted in particular that F. had taken her hand and placed it on his genitals; that F. had taught her to kiss in an adult fashion; and that F. and V. had engaged in certain activities which she had not been able to understand and which she had earlier described to the applicant and the grandmother.', '27.  On 21 November 2013 a panel of experts carried out a forensic psychiatric examination of the applicant’s daughter. In the course of the examination, the child stated that F. had been touching her genitals and she, in compliance with his commands, had had to touch F.’s genitals. F. taught her to kiss in an adult fashion. The child stated that she had seen V. and F. naked and kissing each other; she then described the movements that she had observed V. and F. engaging in while in bed.', '28.  The experts found that the child had not been suffering from any mental illness at the time of the events or at the time of the examination; that she had not shown any tendency to fantasise; and that she was able to remember the circumstances of the events at issue and to give truthful statements in that regard. However, she could not understand the meaning of the actions that she had observed or in which she had participated. The experts concluded that the child could take part in the investigative measures.', '29.  On 9 April 2014 the deputy head of the investigation division of the Sumy regional police department ordered the investigator in charge of the case to immediately speed up the investigation, which, in his opinion, was being conducted too slowly. He requested the investigator to undertake a number of investigative measures.', '30.  On 28 April and 29 September 2014 the Sumy district police closed the criminal proceedings for lack of corpus delicti in the actions of V. and F. Having assessed the available material, the investigator found that there had been insufficient evidence submitted to enable the bringing of charges of sexual abuse. In the last decision the investigator also referred to the statements by F. who was questioned on 20 September 2014 and who denied all the allegations, arguing that they were totally false.', '31.  These two decisions were reversed as unsubstantiated by the supervising prosecutors, who ordered further investigation.', '32.  On 27 December 2014 the Sumy district police decided once again to close the criminal proceedings. In examining the statements of the applicant’s daughter, the investigator considered that these statements could not convincingly prove the alleged events since the child had made those statements belatedly; furthermore, the child had only been three years old at the time of the events in question. The investigator furthermore noted that these statements did not suggest anything in respect of mens rea, in particular whether there was any sexual intent in V.’s and F.’s alleged actions in relation to the child, or whether they had been aware of the fact that the child had been observing them during the alleged instances of sexual intercourse.', '33.  The investigator then referred to the statements of the applicant and his mother, as well as of the mothers of two girls with whom the child had used to play. The latter two women stated in particular that the applicant’s daughter had told them stories which had suggested that she had been subjected to sexual abuse while she had been living with V. and F. The investigator noted that those individuals had not directly observed the alleged instances of sexual abuse and that they had simply repeated statements made by the child. The investigator then stated that V. and F. denied the allegations of child sexual abuse. Other people, such as the child’s teacher at the child-minding centre and village inhabitants, had not provided any more precise information. Overall, the investigator concluded that the available material had been insufficient for him to conclude that V. and F. had committed the alleged crime.', '34.  On 6 March 2015 the Sumy district prosecutor’s office reversed the decision of 27 December 2014 as unsubstantiated. The supervising prosecutor found that the previous instructions given by the prosecutor’s office had not been followed and that it was necessary to take further investigative measures.', '35.  As of 20 January 2016, the investigation was ongoing.', '36.  On 20 June 2012 the Zarichnyy District Court of Sumy dissolved the marriage between the applicant and V. and ruled that the child should live with V. The court ordered the applicant to hand over the child to V. and to pay her a monthly amount for the support of their daughter.', '37.  In determining the place of the child’s residence, the court first established that until 20 September 2011 the child had lived with both parents and her paternal grandparents in the applicant’s flat and that all of them had participated in the upbringing of the child; the paternal grandparents had taken care of the child when both parents had been abroad for six months in 2009; when V. had been abroad for six months over 2010 and 2011 she had transferred money earned by her to the applicant to cover the needs of the family. On 25 October 2010 the child had been admitted to the child-minding centre in Sumy; the child had been accompanied to and from the centre by the applicant.', '38.  The court also established that on 20 September 2011 V. had taken the child and moved from the flat because of conflict between her and the applicant. On 25 October 2011 the child had been admitted to the child‑minding centre in the village of Bezdryk. The child had been accompanied to and from the centre by her mother. On 1 December 2011 the child had been taken from the centre by her father. Since that time the child had been living again in the applicant’s flat in Sumy.', '39.  In comparing the applicant’s flat and the flat where V. was then living, the court found that both flats were located in Sumy and offered appropriate conditions for the residence of the child. In that regard the court referred to the report of the local guardianship office, which stated that both parents provided adequate residential conditions for the child. As to the income of the parents, the father was employed and received a salary; the mother was a student but worked unofficially and had been abroad to earn money. Both parents had positive reference letters and the child had an equal attitude towards both of them.', '40.  The court dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant’s allegation that the mother was negligent with the child and that she might have exercised physical violence against the child: in contrast to the results of the medical examination of 2 December 2011 documenting the injuries on the child’s body (see paragraph 15 above), the staff of the Bezdryk child-minding centre had signed a certificate stating that on 1 December 2011 the child had had no injuries; furthermore, the police had refused to institute criminal investigation in respect of the child’s injuries (see paragraph 19 above). The court concluded that there was no link between V.’s attitude towards the child and the latter’s injuries.', '41.  Relying on the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child of 1959 the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 161 of the Family Code, the court found that the facts did not disclose any exceptional circumstances which could justify the separation of the child from her mother. Consequently, it determined that the child should reside with her mother.', '42.  The applicant appealed against that decision, arguing that the first‑instance court had breached substantive and procedural provisions of domestic legislation and international law. He submitted that in determining the place of the child’s residence the court should have been guided by the principle of the best interests of the child. The applicant insisted that on 20 September 2011 V. had secretly moved with the child from the flat and destroyed the stability of the child’s everyday life. The court had failed to properly examine the allegations that V. had behaved violently towards the child and the possibility that the child had been the target of sexual abuse during the period when she had lived apart from her father with her mother. The applicant emphasised that on 1 December 2011 he had lawfully taken the child back to his flat since the child had previously been permanently living in his flat and he had never given any consent for V. to change the child’s place of residence. In his opinion, the court had paid no attention to the fact that the child had been attached to the paternal grandparents and that her separation from them would be detrimental to her interests. Furthermore, the respective financial capacity of the applicant and V., as well as the residential conditions, had not been properly assessed. Important pieces of evidence had not been included in the case file and part of the evidence had been assessed wrongly – namely, the certificate issued by the Bezdryk child-minding centre regarding the child’s good state of health was a fabricated document that had been discredited by the forensic medical expert report of 2 December 2011.', '43.   On 9 August 2012 the Sumy Regional Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of the first-instance court. The Court of Appeal found that the allegations of child abduction, sexual abuse and physical violence had been groundless. As to the child’s attachment to the paternal grandparents, the Court of Appeal considered that the parents played a more important role in the upbringing of the child. Overall, the findings of the first-instance court had been lawful and reasonable.', '44.  On 14 September 2012 the Higher Specialised Court for Civil and Criminal Matters dismissed a cassation appeal lodged by the applicant as unfounded.']","facts":"The applicant, a resident of Sumy born in 1986, had a daughter with V., born in 1989, and later married her. They lived with their daughter and the applicant’s parents, who assisted in child-rearing. In 2009, both parents worked abroad for six months, leaving the child with the applicant's parents. After returning, their relationship deteriorated, and V. relocated with their child to Bezdryk without informing the applicant. On discovering the child, the applicant noted bruises and sought medical and police intervention, alleging abuse by V. The police declined to open investigations due to insufficient evidence and lack of corpus delicti, despite testimonies from the child claiming inappropriate behavior by V. and her uncle F. The investigation, repeatedly closed, remained inconclusive due to lack of corroborative evidence and testimony consistency. In parallel, the Zarichnyy District Court ruled the child should live with V., dismissing allegations against her as unsubstantiated, which the applicant unsuccessfully challenged through appeals, ultimately upheld by the Higher Specialised Court.","a":"The Court considers that the applicants’ complaints fall to be examined solely under Article 8, which provides as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life ....\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”","b":"The Court finds it appropriate to examine the complaint under Article 8 of the Convention (see, for similar approach, A, B and C v. Latvia, no. 30808\/11, § 116, 31 March 2016). The relevant parts of that Article read as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life ... .\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”","c":"The Court considers that all these complaints are in essence related to an alleged violation of the right to respect for family life guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention, on which the Court will concentrate its examination in this case and which reads insofar as relevant as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his ... family life...\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society ... for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”","d":"The Court, as the master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of any case before it (see Zorica Jovanović v.

The applicant companies, located in Bari, Rome, Pellaro, and Golfo Aranci, were involved in developing land for hotel and tourist complexes on the coast, assuming legitimacy based on regional and municipal approvals. However, subsequent legal proceedings found these permits and land-use plans in violation of national and regional protective laws concerning safeguarded natural sites and landscape areas. Specifically, the permits for developments in Punta Perotti, Bari were quashed due to a contravention of laws prohibiting construction in areas of natural interest, leading to land confiscation without compensation despite acquittals of involved parties for lack of criminal intent. Similarly, in Golfo Aranci and Reggio di Calabria, regional legislation changes imposed stricter building restrictions, rendering previously issued permits ineffective and resulting in site confiscation due to breaches related to building proximities to coastal areas and intended property uses. Although courts recognized some planning mistakes as excusable, the underlying issue remained unresolved until subsequent appeals and rulings led to varied outcomes including returned lands and ongoing compensation claims. The case highlights conflicts between development permissions and environmental protection laws, resulting in a series of judicial reversals and continuing civil litigation for damages.\nArguments: In this connection the Court observes that, relying on the principle established in the Öztürk judgment (cited above, §§ 49 and 56), it has found on many occasions that the “obligation to comply with Article 6 of the Convention does not preclude a ‘penalty’ being imposed by an administrative authority in the first instance” (see Grande Stevens and Others v. Italy, nos. 18640\/10 and 4 others, §§ 138-139, 4 March 2014; see also Kadubec v. Slovakia, 2 September 1998, § 57, Reports 1998-VI; Čanády v. Slovakia, no. 53371\/99, § 31, 16 November 2004; and A. Menarini Diagnostics S.r.l. v. Italy, no. 43509\/08, §§ 58-59, 27 September 2011). This principle has also been confirmed in terms of the right to the presumption of innocence under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention. Thus in the case of Mamidakis v. Greece (no. 35533\/04, § 33, 11 January 2007) the Court found as follows:\n“As to the complaint that the administrative courts did not take account of the fact that the applicant had not been prosecuted for the same offence, the Court takes the view that this situation cannot be analysed as a breach of the right to be presumed innocent. Such a finding would mean that no administrative proceedings could be brought in the absence of criminal proceedings and that no finding of an offence can be made by an administrative court in the absence of a formal declaration of guilt by a criminal court. In addition, the applicant has not raised any other argument which could lead the Court to conclude that the administrative courts had considered him to be guilty before reaching a final decision in his case.”\nHaving thus dismissed the need for there to be criminal proceedings, the Court must nevertheless ascertain whether the impugned confiscation measures at least required a formal declaration of criminal liability in respect of the applicants.\nWhile the applicants emphasised the illegality of the confiscation measure in the absence of a formal conviction, the Government took the view that, except in the case of G.I.E.M. S.r.l., the applicant companies and their representatives, including Mr Gironda, had clearly been found guilty of contravening the planning regulations.\nContinuation options:\nA: The Court, which is master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case, decided to examine the problem raised by the applicant under Article 7 of the Convention which is the relevant provision and which provides insofar as relevant as follows:\n“1.  No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.”\nB: The Court observes that since the applicant companies were not prosecuted themselves, and nor were they parties to the proceedings (see paragraphs 248 above and 269 below), there cannot have been a prior declaration of their liability. Consequently, the question whether the declaration of criminal liability required by Article 7 must meet formal requirements arises only in respect of Mr Gironda.\nC: The Court has identified the deficiencies in the operation of the requisite safeguards in the present case (see paragraph 105 above). Given that the Supreme Court reduced the jury award, the violation at appellate level is, in essence, a procedural one. As the Government have argued, the applicant company is essentially requesting the Court to endorse that company’s own view of the appropriate amount of damages. However, it is not possible to speculate as to the outcome of the proceedings concerned had there been no violation of the Convention (HIT d.d. Nova Gorica v. Slovenia, no. 50996\/08, § 49, 5 June 2014). The Court therefore rejects the claim in respect of pecuniary damage.\nD: The Court observes that the applicant expressly indicated in his observations of 19 March 2007 that he did not have any pecuniary claims in respect of the issue raised by the Court of its own motion. He also submitted no financial claims in respect of his main complaint relating to the alleged unfairness of the criminal proceedings against him. In view of this, the Court finds no grounds whatsoever for concluding that the applicant does not intend to pursue his application and that it is appropriate to strike the case out of the list.","context":"In the case before the European Court of Human Rights, several Italian companies and their representatives faced legal challenges related to land and building permits in different regions of Italy.

The applicant companies have their registered offices respectively in Bari (G.I.E.M. S.r.l.), Rome (Hotel Promotion Bureau S.r.l. and R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l.), and Pellaro (Reggio di Calabria) (Falgest S.r.l.).\\nMr F. Gironda was born in December 1959 and lives in Pellaro.', '8.  The applicant company owned a plot of land in Bari on the coast at Punta Perotti, with a total area of 10,365 sq. m, adjacent to land belonging at the time to a limited liability company Sud Fondi S.r.l. The land was classified as suitable for building in the general land-use plan (piano regolatore generale) in respect of two plots, the rest being earmarked for use by small businesses according to the plan’s specifications.', '9.  In By-Law no. 1042 of 11 May 1992 the Bari municipal council approved a site division and development plan (piano di lottizzazione ‑ hereinafter “site development plan”) submitted by Sud Fondi S.r.l. The plan provided for the construction of a multi-purpose complex, comprising housing, offices and shops. According to the applicant company, its land was automatically incorporated into the development plan by the municipal council.', '10.  On 27 October 1992 the Bari municipal authority asked the applicant company if it wished to be party to a site development agreement in order to be able to build on the land. If its response was negative, the authority would have to expropriate the land under Law no. 6 (1979) of the Apulia Region.', '11.  On 28 October 1992 the applicant company informed the Bari municipal authority that it wished to participate in a site development agreement. The authority did not reply.', '12.  On 19 October 1995 the Bari municipal authority issued a building permit to Sud Fondi S.r.l.', '13.  On 14 February 1996 Sud Fondi S.r.l. began the building work, which had mostly been completed by 17 March 1997.', '14.  On 27 April 1996, following the publication of a newspaper article about the building work carried out near the sea at Punta Perotti, the public prosecutor of Bari opened a criminal investigation.', '15.  On 17 March 1997 the public prosecutor ordered a temporary measure restraining disposal of property in respect of all the buildings in question. He also added the names of certain individuals to the register of persons prosecuted, including those of the authorised representative of Sud Fondi S.r.l. and the managers and foremen responsible for the building work. In his decision the public prosecutor expressed the view that the locality known as Punta Perotti was a protected natural site and that the building of the complex was therefore illegal.', '16.  The representatives of Sud Fondi S.r.l. challenged the temporary restraining measure before the Court of Cassation. In a decision of 17 November 1997 that court declared the measure null and void and ordered the return of all the buildings to their owners, on the ground that it was not prohibited to build on the site according to the land-use plan.', '17.  In a judgment of 10 February 1999 the Bari District Court acknowledged the illegality of the buildings erected at Punta Perotti as they had been built in breach of Law no. 431 of 8 August 1985 (“Law no. 431\/1985”), which prohibited the granting of planning permission in respect of sites of natural interest, including coastal areas. However, since in the present case the local authority had issued the building permits, and in view of the lack of coordination between Law no. 431\/1985 and the regional legislation, which was incomplete, the court found that no negligence or criminal intent could be imputed to the defendants. All the defendants were thus acquitted on the ground that the mental element of the offence had not been made out (“perché il fatto non costituisce reato”).', '18.  In the same judgment, finding that the development plans were materially in breach of Law no. 47\/1985 and illegal, the Bari District Court ordered, in accordance with section 19 of that Law, the confiscation of all the developed land at Punta Perotti, including that belonging to the applicant company, together with the buildings thereon, and the incorporation of the property, without compensation, into the estate of the municipal authority of Bari.', '19.  In an order of 30 June 1999 the Heritage Minister (Ministro dei beni culturali) prohibited any building in the coastal area near the city of Bari, including at Punta Perotti, on the ground that it was a site of significant natural interest. That measure was declared null and void by the Regional Administrative Court the following year.', '20.  The public prosecutor appealed against the judgment of the Bari District Court, calling for the defendants to be convicted.', '21.  In a judgment of 5 June 2000 the Bari Court of Appeal overturned the decision of the court below. It found that the granting of planning permission had been legal, in the absence of any ban on building at Punta Perotti, and there having been no appearance of illegality in the procedure for the adoption and approval of the site development agreements.', '22.  The Court of Appeal thus acquitted the defendants on the ground that no material element of an offence had been made out (“perché il fatto non sussiste”) and revoked the confiscation measure in respect of all the buildings and land. On 27 October 2000 the public prosecutor appealed on points of law.', '23.  In a judgment of 29 January 2001 the Court of Cassation quashed the Court of Appeal’s decision without remitting it. It acknowledged the material illegality of the site development plans on the ground that the land in question was subject to an absolute ban on building and to a landscape protection measure, both provided for by law. In that connection, the court noted that at the time the development plans had been adopted (20 March 1990), Regional Law no. 30\/1990 on landscape protection had not yet entered into force. Consequently, the applicable provisions in the present case were those of Regional Law no. 56 of 1980 (on land use and development) and National Law no. 431\/1985 (on landscape protection).', '24.  The Court of Cassation observed that Law no. 56\/1980 in fact imposed a prohibition on building within the meaning of section 51(F), from which the circumstances of the case allowed no derogation, because the site development plans concerned plots of land that were not situated within the city limits. The court added that, at the time when the site development agreements were adopted, the land in question was included in an implementation plan (piano di attuazione) for the general land-use plan which post-dated the entry into force of Regional Law no. 56\/1980.', '25.  The Court of Cassation noted that in March 1990 (see paragraph 23 above), at the time when the site development plans had been approved, no implementation scheme (programma di attuazione) had been in force. In that connection the court referred to its case-law to the effect that an implementation scheme had to be in force at the time of the approval of site development plans (Court of Cassation, Section 3, 21 January 1997, Volpe; 9 June 1997, Varvara; 24 March 1998, Lucifero). The reason for this was ‑ again according to the case-law – that once an implementation scheme had expired, a building ban which had been discontinued by the scheme would become effective once again. Consequently, it was necessary to find that the land in question had been subject to a building ban at the time of the approval of the site development plans.', '26.  The Court of Cassation further referred to the existence of a landscape protection measure, under section 1 of National Law no. 431\/1985. In the present case, as the competent authorities had not issued a notice of conformity with the requirements of landscape protection (that is, neither the nulla osta approval issued by the national authorities attesting to such conformity – under section 28 of Law no. 150\/1942 – nor the prior approval of the regional authorities under sections 21 and 27 of Law no. 150\/1942, nor the approval of the Regional Planning Committee under sections 21 and 27 of Regional Law no. 56\/1980).', '27.  Lastly, the Court of Cassation noted that the site development plans concerned only 41,885 sq. m, whereas, according to the specifications of the general land-use plan for the city of Bari, the minimum area was set at 50,000 sq. m.', '28.  In the light of those considerations, the Court of Cassation thus found that the site development plans and building permits had been illegal. It acquitted the defendants on the grounds that they could not be found to have negligently or intentionally committed offences and that they had made an “unavoidable and excusable mistake” in the interpretation of the regional legislation, which was “obscure and poorly worded” and interfered with the national law. The Court of Cassation also took into account the conduct of the administrative authorities, and in particular the following facts: on obtaining the building permits, the defendants had been reassured by the director of the relevant municipal office; the site-protection prohibitions with which the construction project was at odds did not appear in the land-use plan; and the competent national authority had not intervened. Lastly, the Court of Cassation found that in the absence of any investigation concerning the reasons for the conduct of the public bodies, it was not possible to speculate on those reasons.', '29.  In the same judgment the Court of Cassation ordered the confiscation of all the buildings and plots of land, on the ground that, in accordance with its case-law, the application of section 19 of Law no. 47 of 1985 was mandatory in the case of illegal site development, even where the property developers had not been convicted.', '30.  The judgment was deposited in the court Registry on 26 March 2001.', '31.  In the meantime, on 1 February 2001 the applicant company had again asked the Bari municipal authority for permission to enter into a site development agreement.', '32.  On 15 February 2001 the Bari municipal authority informed the applicant company that, following the judgment of the Court of Cassation of 29 January 2001, the ownership of the land at Punta Perotti, including that belonging to the applicant company, had been transferred to the municipality.', '33.  The criminal proceedings described above gave rise to another application to the Court (see Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others v. Italy, no. 75909\/01, 20 January 2009).', '34.  On 3 May 2001 the applicant company applied to the Court of Appeal of Bari seeking the return of its land. It alleged that, in line with case-law of the Court of Cassation, the confiscation of property belonging to a third party in relation to criminal proceedings could be ordered only to the extent that the latter had participated in the commission of the offence, in terms of either material or mental elements.', '35.  In a decision of 27 July 2001 the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant company’s appeal.', '36.  The public prosecutor appealed on points of law.', '37.  In a judgment of 9 April 2002 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the Bari Court of Appeal and remitted the case to the Bari District Court.', '38.  The applicant company lodged an interlocutory application for review of the enforcement order, seeking the return of its land.', '39.  In a decision deposited in the court’s Registry on 18 March 2004, the Bari preliminary investigations judge (giudice per le indagini preliminari) dismissed the applicant company’s application. He first observed that the company’s grievances concerned neither the existence nor the formal lawfulness of the impugned measure, which was a mandatory administrative sanction that the criminal court was also entitled to impose in respect of the property of third parties which had not taken part in the commission of the offence of unlawful site development offence. The judge found that the public imperative of protecting land had to prevail over the individual interests.', '40.  The applicant company appealed on points of law. It emphasised that no construction work had actually been carried out on its land, which had not been the subject of a building permit. By its very nature, it argued, a confiscation measure should be directed solely against land upon which unlawful construction had taken place.', '41.  In a judgment of 22 June 2005, deposited in the court’s Registry on 18 January 2006, the Court of Cassation, finding that the Bari preliminary investigations judge had addressed all the points in dispute giving logical and correct reasons, dismissed the applicant company’s appeal on points of law. The court noted that the confiscation of the applicant company’s land had been compliant with its settled case-law whereby the measure provided for in section 19 of Law no. 47 of 1985 was a mandatory administrative sanction imposed by the criminal court on the basis of the incompatibility of the situation of the property in question with the legislation on unlawful site development, even where the defendants had been acquitted. Property owners who were not parties to the criminal proceedings and who claimed to have acted in good faith would be entitled to seek redress before the civil courts.', '42.  According to the information provided by the parties, in October 2012 the Bari municipal authority, having regard to the principles set out and the violations found by the Court in its Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others judgments (merits and just satisfaction, no. 75909\/01, 10 May 2012), asked the Bari District Court to return the confiscated land to the applicant company. In a decision of 12 March 2013 the preliminary investigations judge of that court revoked the confiscation measure and ordered the return of the land on account of the fact that, first, the Court had found a violation of Article 7 of the Convention in Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others and, secondly, that the company was to be regarded as a bona fide third party because none of its directors had been found liable for the offence of unlawful site development. The judge’s decision was entered in the land register on 14 June 2013 and the applicant company was thus able to recover its property on 2 December 2013.', '43.  On 7 April 2005 the applicant company had applied to the Bari District Court, seeking compensation for the damage it had sustained as a result of the conduct of the Bari municipal authority and the consequences for the company’s assets. It reproached the municipal authority for: (1) failing to adopt an alternative to the land-use plan; (2) failing to clarify the existence of the constraints arising as to the authorised use of the areas concerned by the site development at issue; and (3) approving site development procedures which had apparently been lawful but had led to the confiscation of the land and had caused a significant economic loss.\\nAccording to the information provided by the parties, the proceedings were still pending, as the expert’s report evaluating the damage, estimated at 52 million euros by the applicant company, had not yet been filed.', '44.  The applicant company R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l. was the owner of land suitable for building with an area of 33 hectares at Golfo Aranci.', '45.  Under the municipal development scheme (programma comunale di fabbricazione) for Golfo Aranci, approved on 21 December 1981, the land in question belonged to zone F – classified as a tourist zone – and was suitable for building within a given volume. It was possible to exceed that volume in the context of hotel or hotel-type development.', '46.  Wishing to build a hotel-type residential complex for tourists with a number of accommodation units (produttiva alberghiera), R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l. submitted a site development plan (piano di lottizzazione) to the competent authorities.', '47.  On 27 March 1991, under section 13 of Regional Law no. 45 of 1989, the Sardinia Region issued its nulla osta approval for building at a minimum distance of 150 metres from the sea, provided that once erected the buildings would actually be used for tourist accommodation. That obligation had to be recorded in the land register.', '48.  On 29 November 1991 the Sardinia Region granted the landscape transformation permit, under Law no. 431\/1985 and section 7 of Law no. 1497\/1939, to R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l. (see paragraphs 93-96 below).', '49.  The municipality of Golfo Aranci approved the site development plan with final effect on 17 December 1991.', '50.  On 22 April 1992, subject to the regional approval, the municipality of Golfo Aranci authorised the mayor to issue a derogating building permit allowing a greater construction volume than that provided for by its municipal development scheme, for the purposes of a hotel-type structure (opere alberghiere ricettive). The file shows that the site development plan concerned an area of 330,026 sq. m.', '51.  On 17 July 1992 the Sardinia Region issued its final approval of the plan.', '52.  In the meantime, on 22 June 1992, Regional Law no. 11\/1992 had entered into force. It removed the possibility of derogating from the prohibition on building near the sea and fixed the minimum distance at 2 kilometres for dwellings and 500 metres for hotels. As regards buildings intended for hotel-type use, such as the hotel-type residential complexes for tourists in the present case, they were to be treated as dwellings. Under the same law, the minimum distance of 2 kilometres thus had to be maintained, except in the cases where, before 17 November 1989, a site development agreement had already been signed and the infrastructure work had already begun.', '53.  On 17 July 1992 the Sardinia Region authorised the mayor to grant a building permit to R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l. by way of derogation from the municipal land-use plan.', '54.  On 13 August 1992 the mayor of Golfo Aranci and R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l. entered into a site development agreement. Under Article 10 thereof the buildings erected on the site would continue to be used for tourist-hotel purposes and could not be sold off in separate units for a period of twenty years. The agreement stipulated that the development plan was compliant with section 13 of Regional Law no. 45\/1989 and with the other planning regulations; it certified that the applicant company had paid a deposit of an amount equivalent to the total cost of the amenities. That work was to be paid for by the applicant company, which would also be required to assign 30% of the land free of charge to the municipality for the primary infrastructure (urbanizzazione primaria).', '55.  On 31 August 1992 the municipality of Golfo Aranci issued a permit for the primary infrastructure. On 23 November 1992 the municipality issued the building permit for the construction work.', '56.  On 19 February 1993, following the entry into force on 22 June 1992 (see paragraph 52 above) of Regional Law no. 11\/1992, amending Regional Law no. 45\/1989, the regional authority revoked certain permits that had been granted under the previous legislation. The applicant company was not affected.', '57.  The work began in 1993. In 1997 eighty-eight housing units, less than one third of the total number, had been built. A number of them had been sold to individuals, subject to a clause stipulating that the property had to remain assigned, for a number of years, for tourist-hotel use.', '58.  On 28 January 1995 R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l., which was seeking new partners to optimise the project and share the risks, asked the municipal authority whether the sale of the buildings to third parties was compatible with the development agreement. On 14 February 1995 the municipal authority stated that the agreement had been drafted clearly enough; it therefore did not need clarification. It gave a favourable opinion as to the possibility of selling the buildings, but not in single units and provided the intended use of the properties remained unchanged.', '59.  On 11 March 1996 the municipal authority, again approached by the applicant company, confirmed the opinion issued on 14 February 1995.', '60.  At an unknown date, R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l. entered into a preliminary contract of sale with Hotel Promotion Bureau S.r.l. concerning part of the land covered by the development agreement and certain buildings erected in the meantime. In addition, on 15 January 1996, Hotel Promotion Bureau S.r.l. entered into an agreement (contratto di appalto) with R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l. under which the latter undertook to carry out construction work on the land forming the object of the preliminary contract of sale.', '61.  With a view to becoming the owner of the land and buildings, on 26 February 1997 Hotel Promotion Bureau S.r.l. also signed agreements with a travel agent for the purpose of renting out units on a weekly basis.', '62.  On 22 October 1997 R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l. sold to Hotel Promotion Bureau S.r.l. 36,859 sq. m of land and the buildings known as “C2”, namely sixteen units for residential-tourist use. In addition to the buildings R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l. assigned the construction rights to Hotel Promotion Bureau S.r.l. The price of the transaction was fixed at 7,200,000,000 Italian lire (ITL), equivalent to 3,718,489.67 euros (EUR).', '63.  In November 1997 R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l. was the owner of sixteen housing units and the plots of land covered by the site development plan, with the exception of plot no. 644 and those previously sold to Hotel Promotion Bureau S.r.l., which was the owner of the land it had purchased and of sixteen units.', '64.  On 26 March 1998 the municipal authority approved the transfer (voltura) of the building permit concerning the land and buildings purchased by Hotel Promotion Bureau S.r.l.', '65.  On 3 April 2006, further to a request by R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l. for a planning certificate in respect of the relevant property for the period 1990‑1997, the municipal authority stated that the development agreement signed with R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l. and the permits granted were compatible with the planning regulations in force at the material time, and in particular with Regional Law no. 45\/1989, and it therefore considered that the offence of unlawful site development was not made out in the circumstances.', '66.  In 1997 the public prosecutor of Olbia opened a criminal investigation in respect of Mr M.C. and Mr L.C., the legal representatives of the applicant companies. They were suspected of a number of offences, including that of unlawful site development within the meaning of section 20 of Law no. 47\/1985 for building too close to the sea and without planning permission, together with fraud for changing the intended use of the properties in breach of the development agreement.', '67.  On 20 November 1997 a court order restraining disposal of property was imposed on the land and buildings.', '68.  In a decision of 17 January 2000 the Sassari District Court returned the land and buildings to their rightful owners.', '69.  In a judgment of 31 March 2003 the Olbia District Court acquitted M.C. and L.C. on the merits in respect of all the offences, with the exception of that of unlawful site development, the prosecution of which was declared statute-barred.', '70.  Having regard to the entry into force of Regional Law no. 11 of 1992 (see paragraph 52 above) and the new minimum distance from the sea introduced therein, the District Court took the view that the municipality of Golfo Aranci should never have issued the building permits and that the previously issued authorisations could not legitimise the situation. The building permits were thus in breach of the law or, at least, ineffective (inefficaci). Although erected in accordance with the permits issued by the municipal authority, the constructions were thus incompatible with the statutory provisions and their existence thus constituted unlawful site development. In addition, the sale of the housing units to individuals cast doubt on their continued use for tourist-hotel purposes and this change of purpose also placed the buildings in breach of the law. In conclusion, the District Court ordered the confiscation of the property previously placed under a restraining order and the transfer of ownership to the municipality of Golfo Aranci within the meaning of section 19 of Law no. 47\/1985.', '71.  As regards, in particular, the charge of fraud, the court took the view that the offence was not made out because there had been no financial loss to the municipality, since the cost of the infrastructure work remained the same even if the intended use changed. In addition, the mental element, that is to say the existence of intent to defraud the municipality, had not been proved in view of the fact that the sale had been carried out as a result of the financial difficulties of R.I.T.A. Sarda S.r.l. Moreover, the court pointed out that the municipal authority had issued the company with a favourable opinion as regards the sale of the buildings.', '72.  In a judgment of 11 October 2004 the Cagliari Court of Appeal upheld the Olbia District Court’s finding of dismissal (non doversi procedere) in respect of the offence which was statute-barred and reiterated that the municipality of Golfo Aranci should not have issued the building permits, which were illegal and in any event ineffective. The constructions erected were de facto incompatible with the regional legislation prohibiting them. In addition, between March 1995 and November 1997 most of the housing units had been sold off, thus changing their intended use. As to the charge of fraud, the Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal of the applicant companies’ legal representatives on the basis of the same considerations, on this point, as those of the District Court. It confirmed the confiscation order.', '73.  Mr M.C. and Mr L.C. appealed on points of law but their appeal was dismissed by the Court of Cassation in a judgment of 15 February 2007.', '74.  According to the information provided by the Government, on 29 July 2015 the individual purchasers of the confiscated property still retained full possession. Shortly before that, on 21 May 2015, a resolution of the municipality of Golfo Aranci had acknowledged the genuine interest of the community in keeping the confiscated complex, referring in particular to the possibility of using the housing to cope with situations of urgency in the event that the local authorities should decide to assign the use of the property, directly or indirectly, for rent by persons with low income.', '75.  The company Falgest S.r.l. and Mr Filippo Gironda were the co‑owners, each with a 50% interest, of a plot of land at Testa di Cane and Fiumarella di Pellaro (Reggio di Calabria) with a total surface area of 11,870 sq. m. The land-use plan provided solely for the possibility of building hotel-type residential complexes for tourists on that land.', '76.  On 12 October 1994 the applicants applied for a building permit to erect a tourist residential complex consisting of forty-two houses and sports facilities.', '77.  On 15 September 1997 the municipality of Reggio di Calabria issued the building permit.', '78.  After verification by the municipality, a number of variations from the plan were noted. The municipality ordered the suspension of the work on 26 January 1998.', '79.  On 29 January 1998 the applicants filed an amended plan (variante in corso d’opera), which provided for fewer houses (forty instead of forty‑two) and restricted the construction area. This amended plan sought to regularise the work as already carried out, within the meaning of Law no. 47\/1985.', '80.  On 10 February 1998 the mayor of Reggio di Calabria cancelled the order suspending the work on the ground that the discrepancies in relation to the initial construction project could be regularised by means of the amended plan submitted in respect of ongoing work under section 15 of Law no. 47\/1985.', '81.  On 1 October 1998 the inspector of the municipality of Reggio di Calabria noted that the work was in conformity with the amended plan. The work was pursued.', '82.  In 2002 the public prosecutor of Reggio di Calabria opened an investigation in respect of Mr Gironda, in his capacity as co-owner of the property, and five others: a director of the company, two signatories to the development project and two foremen. They were all suspected of committing a number of offences, in particular that of unlawful site development within the meaning of section 20 of Law no. 47\/1985.', '83.  In a judgment of 22 January 2007 the Reggio di Calabria District Court acquitted all the defendants on the merits (perché il fatto non sussiste) in respect of all the charges, except for the offence of unlawful site development, the prosecution of which it declared statute-barred. The court noted that the project had provided for the construction of residences for hotel-type tourist accommodation. However, the structural specifications of the buildings (caratteristiche strutturali) and the evidence suggested that the real purpose of the project was the sale of houses to individuals, thus casting doubt on the intended hotel-type tourist use. This change of purpose rendered the site development unlawful. In conclusion, the court ordered the confiscation of the land and buildings and the transfer of the property to the municipality of Reggio di Calabria under section 19 of Law no. 47 of 1985.', '84.  In a judgment of 28 April 2009 the Reggio di Calabria Court of Appeal acquitted the applicants on the merits (perché il fatto non sussiste) in respect of all the charges, including that of unlawful site development. It revoked the confiscation of the property and ordered its return to the owners.', '85.  The Court of Appeal took the view, in particular, that the approved project was compatible with the land-use plan and the planning regulations. Given that there had been no preliminary or final contract of sale, there was no evidence of any change in the purpose of the constructions and therefore no unlawful development.', '86.  In a judgment of 22 April 2010, deposited in the Registry on 27 September 2010, the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the Court of Appeal without remitting it, finding that the change in purpose of the constructions was proved by statements made by third parties and by documents in the file. For the Court of Cassation, the offence of unlawful site development (the prosecution of which was statute-barred, entailing the dismissal of the case) had thus indeed been knowingly committed by the defendants. Consequently, the property in question again became subject to the confiscation order made at first instance by the Reggio di Calabria District Court. The acquittals were maintained.', '87.  According to an expert’s report of 5 May 2015, the expert having been appointed by the applicants, the complex confiscated from the latter was in an advanced state of abandonment and neglect. In the applicants’ submission, the municipal authority, which was the owner of the property, had not carried out any work to keep the open spaces maintained.']","facts":"In the case before the European Court of Human Rights, several Italian companies and their representatives faced legal challenges related to land and building permits in different regions of Italy. The applicant companies, located in Bari, Rome, Pellaro, and Golfo Aranci, were involved in developing land for hotel and tourist complexes on the coast, assuming legitimacy based on regional and municipal approvals. However, subsequent legal proceedings found these permits and land-use plans in violation of national and regional protective laws concerning safeguarded natural sites and landscape areas. Specifically, the permits for developments in Punta Perotti, Bari were quashed due to a contravention of laws prohibiting construction in areas of natural interest, leading to land confiscation without compensation despite acquittals of involved parties for lack of criminal intent. Similarly, in Golfo Aranci and Reggio di Calabria, regional legislation changes imposed stricter building restrictions, rendering previously issued permits ineffective and resulting in site confiscation due to breaches related to building proximities to coastal areas and intended property uses. Although courts recognized some planning mistakes as excusable, the underlying issue remained unresolved until subsequent appeals and rulings led to varied outcomes including returned lands and ongoing compensation claims. The case highlights conflicts between development permissions and environmental protection laws, resulting in a series of judicial reversals and continuing civil litigation for damages.","a":"The Court, which is master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case, decided to examine the problem raised by the applicant under Article 7 of the Convention which is the relevant provision and which provides insofar as relevant as follows:\n“1.  No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.”","b":"The Court observes that since the applicant companies were not prosecuted themselves, and nor were they parties to the proceedings (see paragraphs 248 above and 269 below), there cannot have been a prior declaration of their liability. Consequently, the question whether the declaration of criminal liability required by Article 7 must meet formal requirements arises only in respect of Mr Gironda.","c":"The Court has identified the deficiencies in the operation of the requisite safeguards in the present case (see paragraph 105 above). Given that the Supreme Court reduced the jury award, the violation at appellate level is, in essence, a procedural one. As the Government have argued, the applicant company is essentially requesting the Court to endorse that company’s own view of the appropriate amount of damages. However, it is not possible to speculate as to the outcome of the proceedings concerned had there been no violation of the Convention (HIT d.d. Nova Gorica v. Slovenia, no. 50996\/08, § 49, 5 June 2014). The Court therefore rejects the claim in respect of pecuniary damage.","d":"The Court observes that the applicant expressly indicated in his observations of 19 March 2007 that he did not have any pecuniary claims in respect of the issue raised by the Court of its own motion. He also submitted no financial claims in respect of his main complaint relating to the alleged unfairness of the criminal proceedings against him. In view of this, the Court finds no grounds whatsoever for concluding that the applicant does not intend to pursue his application and that it is appropriate to strike the case out of the list.","label":"B","difficulty_signal_facts_len":0.5914634146,"difficulty_signal_context_len":0.3470411234,"difficulty_signal_option_similarity":0.1014589296,"difficulty_signal_overlap_ambiguity":0.9705455829,"difficulty_signal_negation_density":0.8969768825,"toughness_score":0.5662215132}

During World War II, as Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, he fled to Russia, joined the Soviet Army in 1942, and received training in sabotage operations. He was later promoted to sergeant. On 27 May 1944, he participated in an attack on the village of Mazie Bati, orchestrated by a Soviet commando unit called the \"Vilis Laiviņš,\" which he joined. The attack was a reprisal against villagers suspected of collaborating with German forces. During this assault, several villagers, including women, were killed, homes were burned, and properties were pillaged. Post-war, the applicant was honored in the USSR and joined the Communist Party. Latvia, upon restoring independence in 1991, later charged him in 1998 with war crimes related to these events. Although initially acquitted of war crimes but found guilty of banditry, conviction complexities involved issues of historical, legal interpretations of actions under Soviet versus Latvian laws during occupations. Eventually, the Latvian courts concluded that his actions constituted war crimes under international law, sentencing him but considering time served due to pre-trial detention. The case entwined with Latvia’s historical struggle with identity and legal continuity against Soviet dominion.\nArguments: Likewise, the Court does not dispute that it was only from the restoration of Latvian independence in 1991 that the authorities of that State were able to bring criminal proceedings against those suspected of having committed offences between 1940 and 1991. It notes, however, that there is not and never has been any provision in Latvian law which would make it possible to suspend or extend limitation periods solely on account of the offences in question being committed at a time when the country was under foreign domination. This argument by the Government must therefore be rejected.\nIn sum, even supposing that the applicant committed one or more offences under the general law on 27 May 1944, the Court finds that their prosecution has been definitively statute barred since 1954 and that it would be contrary to the principle of foreseeability inherent in Article 7 of the Convention to punish him for these offences almost half a century after the expiry of the limitation period.\nThe Government submitted in the alternative that the applicant's conduct during the attack on Mazie Bati “was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations”, within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 7 of the Convention. In that connection, the Court notes that on virtually every occasion the Convention institutions have examined a case under the second paragraph of Article 7, they have not considered it necessary also to examine it under the first paragraph (De Becker v. Belgium, no. 214\/56, Commission decision of 9 June 1958, Yearbook 2, p. 214; X. v.

Estonia (dec.), no. 14685\/04, 24 January 2006, and the Kolk and Kislyiy decision cited above). The Court sees no reason to deviate from that approach in the present case. Since it has examined the case under the first paragraph of Article 7, it does not consider it necessary also to examine it under the second paragraph. In any event, even supposing that that paragraph was applicable in the instant case, the operation of 27 May 1944 cannot be regarded as “criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations”.\nContinuation options:\nA: In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the applicant could not reasonably have foreseen on 27 May 1944 that his acts amounted to a war crime under the jus in bello applicable at the time. There was, therefore, no plausible legal basis in international law on which to convict him of such an offence. Even supposing that the applicant has committed one or more offences under the general domestic law, their prosecution has long since become statute barred. Accordingly, domestic law could not serve as the basis for his conviction either.\nB: Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that the applicant was convicted under Article 148-1 § 7 of the Criminal Code, as worded since 13 January 1995, of tax offences which were committed in the period from 1993 to 1996. \nIt observes that the application of the criminal law of 13 January 1995 to subsequent acts is not at issue in the instance case. The question to be determined is whether the extension of the law to acts committed prior to that date infringed the guarantee set forth in Article 7 of the Convention.\nC: The Court, which is master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case, decided to examine the problem raised by the applicant under Article 7 of the Convention which is the relevant provision and which provides insofar as relevant as follows:\n“1.  No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.”\nD: At the outset, the Court reiterates that it is not its task to review in abstracto whether the retroactive application of the 2003 Code in war crimes cases is, per se, incompatible with Article 7 of the Convention. This matter must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the specific circumstances of each case and, notably, whether the domestic courts have applied the law whose provisions are most favourable to the defendant (see Scoppola, cited above, § 109).","context":"The applicant, born in 1923 in Latvia, initially held Latvian nationality before acquiring Russian citizenship in 2000.

This argument by the Government must therefore be rejected.\nIn sum, even supposing that the applicant committed one or more offences under the general law on 27 May 1944, the Court finds that their prosecution has been definitively statute barred since 1954 and that it would be contrary to the principle of foreseeability inherent in Article 7 of the Convention to punish him for these offences almost half a century after the expiry of the limitation period.\nThe Government submitted in the alternative that the applicant's conduct during the attack on Mazie Bati “was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations”, within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 7 of the Convention. In that connection, the Court notes that on virtually every occasion the Convention institutions have examined a case under the second paragraph of Article 7, they have not considered it necessary also to examine it under the first paragraph (De Becker v. Belgium, no. 214\/56, Commission decision of 9 June 1958, Yearbook 2, p. 214; X. v. Norway, no. 931\/60, Commission decision of 30 May 1961, Collection of Decisions of the European Commission on Human Rights no. 6, p. 41; X. v. Belgium, no. 1028\/61, Commission decision of 18 September 1961, Yearbook no. 4, p. 325; and Naletilić v. Croatia (dec.), no. 51891\/99, ECHR 2000‑V, as also the decisions of X. v. Belgium (no. 268\/57), Touvier and Papon (no. 2) cited above; for more extensive reasoning, see Penart v. Estonia (dec.), no. 14685\/04, 24 January 2006, and the Kolk and Kislyiy decision cited above). The Court sees no reason to deviate from that approach in the present case. Since it has examined the case under the first paragraph of Article 7, it does not consider it necessary also to examine it under the second paragraph. In any event, even supposing that that paragraph was applicable in the instant case, the operation of 27 May 1944 cannot be regarded as “criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations”.","case_id":"001-87934_148","case_no":"36376\/04","complete_facts":"['8.  The applicant was born in 1923 in the municipality of Mērdzene (district of Ludza, Latvia). He held Latvian nationality until 12 April 2000, when he was granted Russian nationality by a special decree issued by the President of the Russian Federation, Mr V. Putin.', '9.  On 22 June 1941 Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, of which Latvian territory formed a part. The lightning advance of the German Army (Wehrmacht) forced the Red Army to leave the Baltic region and withdraw towards Russia. The applicant, who was living near the border at the time, followed. By 5 July 1941 the whole of Latvia had been overrun by the Wehrmacht. The three Baltic States and part of Belarus were joined to form a vast territory administered by the Reich Commissariat for the Eastern Territories (Reichskomissariat Ostland), which took orders directly from Berlin.', '10.  After arriving in Russia the applicant initially found work on a collective farm (kolkhoze). He was subsequently employed as a metal turner in a factory that manufactured military equipment. In 1942 he was called up as a soldier in the Soviet Army and assigned to the reserve regiment of the Latvian Division. From 1942 to 1943 he received special training in sabotage operations (подрывники in Russian), during which he learnt how to organise and lead commando raids behind enemy lines. After completing his training he was immediately promoted to the rank of sergeant. Shortly afterwards, on the night of 23 June 1943 he and some twenty fellow combatants were parachuted into Belarus territory, which was then under German occupation, near the Latvian border and thus to the area where he was born.', '11.  After landing, the applicant joined a Soviet commando unit (composed of members of the “Red Partisans”) called the “Vilis Laiviņš” after its leader. In March 1944 he was put in command of a platoon by his two immediate superiors, whose primary objectives according to the applicant were as follows: to sabotage military installations, communication lines and German supply points, to derail trains and to spread political propaganda among the local population. The applicant claimed to have derailed 16 military trains and caused 42 German military targets to be blown up.', '12.  On 27 May 1944 the Red Partisans attacked the village of Mazie Bati (municipality of Mērdzene, district of Ludza), which at the time was approximately 80 kilometres from the front.', \"13.  The events of 27 May 1944, as established by the public prosecutor's office and the Latvian courts, and acknowledged by the respondent Government may be summarised as follows.\", \"14.  In February 1944 the German Army discovered and wiped out a group of Red Partisans led by Major Chugunov who were hiding in a barn in the village of Mazie Bati. The applicant and his unit immediately suspected the villagers of having spied for the Germans and of having turned Chugunov's men in to the enemy. It was then decided to take reprisals against the inhabitants of Mazie Bati.\", '15.  Meanwhile, in constant fear of an attack by the Red Partisans, the male inhabitants of Mazie Bati – who up to then had not carried weapons – sought assistance from the German military administration, which ultimately provided every man with a rifle and two grenades “for his own protection”.', \"16.  On 27 May 1944 the applicant and his men, who were armed and wearing Wehrmacht uniforms to avoid arousing suspicion, entered the village where the inhabitants were preparing to celebrate Pentecost. The commando unit split up into a number of small groups each of which attacked a house on the applicant's orders. Several Partisans burst into the home of a farmer, Modests Krupniks, seized weapons they found there and ordered him out into the yard. When he pleaded with them not to kill him in front of his children, they ordered him to run towards the forest before opening fire when he did so. Krupniks was left, seriously wounded, on the edge of the forest, where he died the following morning from a massive haemorrhage. Although the surviving villagers heard his screams and groans, they were too afraid to go to his aid.\", \"17.  Two other groups of Red Partisans attacked the homes of two other farmers, Meikuls Krupniks and Ambrozs Buļs. Meikuls Krupniks was seized in his bath and savagely beaten. The Partisans took the weapons they had found in the two villagers' homes to Meikuls Krupniks' house. There they fired several rounds of bullets at Buļs, Meikuls Krupniks and Krupniks' mother. According to the initial findings of fact by the prosecutor's office and the first-instance court, it was the applicant himself who killed Buļs. However, he was subsequently acquitted in relation to that incident (see paragraph 45 below). Meikuls Krupniks and his mother were seriously injured. The Partisans then doused the house and all the farm buildings (including the barn and stable) with petrol and set them alight. Krupniks' wife, who was nine months pregnant, managed to escape, but was seized by the Partisans and pushed through a window of the house into the flames. The following morning the surviving villagers found the charred remains of the four victims. Mrs Krupniks' body was identified by the badly burnt skeleton of the baby lying next to her.\", \"18.  A fourth group of Partisans burst into Vladislavs Šķirmants' home, where they found him on his bed with his one year-old son. After finding a rifle and two grenades hidden in a cupboard, they ordered Šķirmants – who was still in his underwear – to go out into the yard. They then bolted the door from the outside to prevent his wife following him, took him to a remote corner of the yard and shot him dead.\", '19.  A fifth group attacked the home of Juliāns Šķirmants. After finding and seizing a rifle and two grenades, the Partisans took him out to the barn, where they executed him.', \"20.  Lastly, a sixth group attacked Bernards Šķirmants' home, seizing the weapons they found there. They then proceeded to kill Mr Šķirmants, wound his wife and set all the farm buildings on fire. Mr Šķirmants' wife burnt to death in the fire with her dead husband lying beside her. According to the initial domestic decisions, it was the applicant himself who killed Šķirmants. However, he was later acquitted of that charge (see paragraph 45 below).\", \"21.  According to the prosecution's initial findings of fact, the Partisans pillaged the village before leaving and made off with clothes and food, in addition to the weapons. In particular, before leaving Juliāns Šķirmants' house they stole a tub of butter and a roll of material. This factual finding did not, however, appear in either the final judgment on the merits or the final judgment on the appeal on points of law, both of which refer only to the seizure of the weapons found in the villagers' homes.\", \"22.  The applicant contests the factual findings of the domestic courts. In his estimation, all the victims of the attack were collaborators and traitors who had delivered Major Chugunov's platoon into the hands of the Germans in February 1944 by ruse, while Meikuls Krupniks and Bernards Šķirmants were Schutzmänner (members of the German auxiliary police force). In February 1944 Chugunov's group of Partisans – comprising nine men, two women and a small child – had taken refuge in Krupniks' barn. Three women (Krupniks' mother and wife and Bernards Šķirmants' wife) brought them provisions and assured them that the Wehrmacht was some distance away. However, while the women kept watch, Šķirmants sent Krupniks to alert a German garrison stationed in the neighbouring village. On arriving in Mazie Bati, the German soldiers had machine-gunned the barn with incendiary bullets causing it to catch fire. Any member of Chugunov's group, including the women and the child, who tried to escape was shot dead. After the carnage, Krupniks' mother had removed the coats from the bodies. For its part, the German military command had rewarded the villagers concerned with firewood, sugar, alcohol and a sum of money.\", \"23.  Approximately a week before the events of 27 May 1944, the applicant and all the men in his platoon had received a summons from their commanding officer. He had informed them that an ad hoc military court composed of members of the detachment had delivered judgment against the inhabitants of Mazie Bati allegedly implicated in the betrayal of Chugunov's men and that their platoon was required to execute the order. More specifically, they were required to “bring the six Schutzmänner from Mazie Bati to stand trial”. The applicant had refused to lead the operation as the villagers had known him since childhood and he feared for the safety of his parents, who lived in the neighbouring village. The commanding officer had bowed to his wishes and assigned the mission to another Partisan. In the events that had followed, it was that other Partisan – not the applicant – who had given the orders.\", \"24.  On 27 May 1944 the applicant had followed the men from his unit, but had not entered the village. He had hidden behind a bush from which he could see Modests Krupniks' house. Shortly afterwards he had heard cries and gunfire and seen plumes of smoke. A quarter of an hour later, the Partisans had returned alone. One had been wounded in the arm; another was carrying six rifles, ten grenades and a large quantity of cartridges. All the weapons and munitions had been seized in the villagers' homes. The applicant's men told him that they had not been able to carry out their mission as the villagers had “fled while firing at them and the Germans had arrived”. In his submissions to the Court, the applicant denied that his comrades had pillaged Mazie Bati. On returning to base, the Partisans had been severely reprimanded by the commanding officer for failing to capture the wanted persons.\", '25.  Documents furnished by the Government from the Latvian Historical National Archives (Latvijas Valsts vēstures arhīvs) provides the following information on the regime set up by the occupying German administration during the relevant period.', '26.  By a notice published in the newspapers on 24 July 1941, the Reichskomissar for the Eastern Territories, Hinrich Lohse, ordered all citizens to surrender any firearms and munitions in their possession to the authorities within 24 hours. The notice reappeared on 1 October 1941 and 12 August 1942. Members of the Latvian auxiliary police were, however, permitted to carry firearms.', \"27.  Subsequently, as the front drew closer to Latvian territory and the number of Red Partisans in the border regions increased, the rules concerning the possession and carrying of firearms were relaxed. In a letter of 22 October 1998 to the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office, the Director of the Archives stated that the village of Mazie Bati was within the jurisdiction of police station no. 2 in the district of Ludza at the relevant time. Since the records from that police station had been lost or destroyed, there was no documentary evidence available to give a precise explanation for the Germans' decision to arm the villagers of Mazie Bati. However, the archives did contain a written order from the local commanding officer of the Latvian auxiliary police to the officer in charge at police station no. 1 in the same district concerning the village of Čeverova (which was approximately 20 kilometres from Mazie Bati). This document, dated 25 February 1944, reads as follows:\\n“In order to protect the population from attacks by pillaging bandits, I order you to set up a defence unit in the village of Čeverova (in the municipality of Cibla) composed of ten to fifteen trustworthy local men. Those selected will receive rifles and the necessary quantity of munitions. A local aizsargs [member of the National Guard] will take command of the defence unit. The selected men will be required to gather every night to mount guard and keep watch.\\nReport to me by 28 February on the execution of [this order].”\", '28.  Further, in a letter dated 27 April 1944 the same commanding officer instructed the mayors of three municipalities (including Cibla) to select a person of trust from the inhabitants of each village who would be responsible for the surveillance of strangers or suspicious individuals and informing the mayor or police where necessary. The letter stated that these measures were intended to counteract the acts of “bandits” (by which was meant the Red Partisans).', '29.  In July 1944 the Red Army entered Latvia. On 13 October 1944 it laid siege to and took Riga. On 8 May 1945 the last German divisions surrendered and the entire Latvian territory passed into the control of the Red Army.', '30.  The applicant remained in Latvia after the war ended. He was decorated for his military exploits with the Order of Lenin, the highest distinction awarded in the USSR. In November 1946 he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1957 he graduated from the USSR Interior Ministry Academy. Subsequently, and until his retirement in 1988, he worked as an officer in various branches of the Soviet police force.', \"31.  On 4 May 1990 the Supreme Council of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Latvia adopted the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence, which declared Latvia's incorporation into the USSR unlawful and null and void and restored force of law to the fundamental provisions of the 1922 Constitution. After two unsuccessful coups d'état, on 21 August 1991 the Supreme Council passed the Constitutional Law on the Statehood of the Republic of Latvia proclaiming full independence with immediate effect.\", \"32.  By a law passed on 6 April 1993, the Supreme Council inserted into the special section of the former Criminal Code then in force a new Chapter 1-a, which contained provisions criminalising acts such as genocide, crimes against humanity or peace, war crimes and racial discrimination. A new Article 68-3 dealt with war crimes, which carried sentences of between three and fifteen years' imprisonment or life imprisonment. The same law also inserted an Article 6-1 into the Code permitting the retrospective application of the criminal law with respect to crimes against humanity and war crimes and an Article 45-1, which exempted such offences from statutory limitation.\", \"33.  In January 1998 the Centre for the Documentation of the Consequences of Totalitarianism (Totalitārisma seku dokumentēšanas centrs), an affiliate of the Constitution Protection Bureau (Satversmes aizsardzības birojs), launched a criminal investigation into the events of 27 May 1944. It considered that the applicant could have committed an offence under Article 68-3 of the former Criminal Code. On 28 July 1998 the investigation file was sent to the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office (Ģenerālprokuratūra).\", \"34.  In a decision of 2 August 1998, the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office charged the applicant with war crimes. On 10 October 1998 the applicant was brought before the Riga Central Court of First Instance, which ordered his detention pending trial.\", '35.  On 19 November 1998 the prosecution announced that it had completed its investigation and served the papers on the applicant and his lawyer. On 17 December 1998 the applicant completed his examination of the documents in the investigation file. The following day the prosecution drew up the final bill of indictment (apsūdzības raksts) and forwarded the file to the Riga Regional Court, which would sit as the court of trial. According to the bill of indictment, the prosecution had also identified most of the other former Partisans who had taken part in the Mazie Bati operation. However, they had all died in the interim.', \"36.  The substance of the charges was examined by the Riga Regional Court at a hearing on 21 January 2000 at which the applicant pleaded not guilty. He repeated his account of the events of 27 May 1944, stressing in particular that all the victims of the attack, including Meikuls Krupniks' pregnant wife, had been armed Schutzmänner. He denied any personal involvement in the events. As to the various documents, press articles and post-war works that attested to the contrary, he maintained that he had knowingly allowed the historical facts to be distorted for his own personal glory and in order to gain certain benefits. However, the Regional Court found that the file contained ample evidence of his guilt, namely:\\n(a)  The depositions of eight children of the villagers killed by the Red Partisans on 27 May 1944. Three of these children were direct eye witnesses who had seen their parents killed. The other five had been in the neighbouring village at the time or too young to understand what was happening. However, they recalled accounts of the events related by members of their families.\\n(b)  The depositions of 19 witnesses, including four direct eye witnesses.\\n(c)  Various post-war records drawn up and signed by the applicant in person in which his account of the events in Mazie Bati exactly matched the facts as reconstructed by the prosecution. In particular, he had expressly admitted shooting Ambrozs Buļs dead and burning six people alive.\\n(d)  Various records signed by the applicant's commanding officers, which gave a like account.\\n(e)  A handwritten exercise book seized at the applicant's home containing the outline of an autobiographical work he had planned to write. The description it contained of the attack on 27 May 1944 was generally consistent with the facts as established by the prosecution.\\n(f)  Various historical and encyclopaedic works, together with press articles and verbal accounts by the applicant which had been published in Soviet newspapers in the 1960s and 1970s.\\n(g)  Depositions by the author of one of the aforementioned articles attesting to the fact that the description given in his article was based on the applicant's own account.\\n(h)  Various documents from the Latvian National Archives containing information on the villagers from Mazie Bati, and on the actions and decisions of the German military administration at the material time.\\n(i)  Depositions by a woman who had worked as a radio operator for the applicant's unit during the war.\", '37.  On the basis of all this evidence, the Regional Court concluded that the applicant had perpetrated acts that were prohibited by the Charter of the International Military Tribunal for Nuremberg of 8 August 1945, the Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 concerning the laws and customs of war on land, and the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Consequently, it found him guilty of the offence set out in Article 68-3 of the former Criminal Code and imposed an immediate six-year custodial sentence. Both the applicant and the prosecution appealed against that judgment to the Criminal Affairs Division of the Supreme Court..', \"38.  In a judgment of 25 April 2000, the Criminal Affairs Division quashed the impugned judgment and returned the case file to the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office with instructions to make additional inquiries. It stated in its judgment that there were lacunae in the Regional Court's reasoning. In particular, the Regional Court had failed to deal clearly with questions that were decisive to the outcome of the case. Thus, issues such as whether Mazie Bati had in fact been within an “occupied territory”, whether the applicant and his victims could be classified as “combatants” and “non-combatants” respectively and whether the fact that the German military administration had armed the villagers would make them “prisoners of war” in the event of their arrest remained unresolved. In addition, the Criminal Affairs Division stated that in the special circumstances of the case, the prosecution should have consulted specialists on history and international criminal law. It also decided to vary the preventive measure that had been imposed on the applicant and ordered his immediate release.\", \"39.  The prosecution appealed on points of law against the judgment of the Criminal Affairs Division. In a judgment of 27 June 2000, the Supreme Court Senate dismissed that appeal, although it amended the reasons that had been given by the Criminal Affairs Division for referring the case for further investigation. In particular, it ruled that the Criminal Affairs Division's direction that specialist advice should have been taken on international law was unfounded as expert evidence could not be sought on questions of pure law, which were solely for the courts to decide.\", \"40.  On 17 May 2001 the applicant was again charged with an offence under Article 68-3 of the former Criminal Code after a fresh preliminary investigation by the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office. The Supreme Court Senate designated the Latgale Regional Court as the court of first instance.\", \"41.  The substance of the charge against the applicant was examined by the Latgale Regional Court on 3 October 2003. In a judgment delivered at the end of that hearing, the Regional Court acquitted the applicant of war crimes, but found him guilty of banditry, an offence under Article 72 of the former Criminal Code carrying a sentence of between three and fifteen years' imprisonment.\", \"42.  After analysing the situation in which Latvia had found itself as a result of the events in 1940 and the German invasion, the Regional Court concluded that the applicant could under no circumstances be equated to a “representative of the occupying forces”. On the contrary, he had fought for the liberation of the country against the occupying forces of Nazi Germany. As Latvia had been incorporated into the USSR, the applicant's conduct had to be considered in the light of Soviet law. In addition, he could not reasonably have foreseen that he would one day be classified as a “representative of the Soviet occupation forces”. With regard to the Mazie Bati operation, the Regional Court accepted that the villagers had collaborated with the German military administration and handed over Chugunov's group of Red Partisans to the Wehrmacht and that the attack on the village had been carried out pursuant to the judgment of the ad hoc military court set up within the detachment. The Regional Court also accepted that the deaths of the six men from Mazie Bati could be regarded as having been necessary and justified by considerations of a military order. However, it found that such justification did not extend to the killing of the three women or the burning down of the village buildings. Consequently, as they had not confined themselves to executing the ad hoc military court's judgment, but had acted beyond their authority, both the applicant and his men had committed an act of banditry for which they bore full responsibility. Furthermore, as the commanding officer, the applicant was responsible for acts committed by his unit. However, since banditry did not fall into the category of offences exempt from statutory limitation, the Regional Court relieved the applicant of criminal liability on the ground that the prosecution of the offence was statute barred.\", \"43.  Both parties appealed against that judgment to the Criminal Affairs Division of the Supreme Court. Relying, inter alia, on Article 7 § 1 of the Convention, the applicant sought a full acquittal, arguing that the law had been applied against him retrospectively. The prosecution submitted that the Regional Court had made a number of serious errors of fact and law. In its view, the Regional Court had completely neglected the fact that Latvia's incorporation into the USSR was contrary to the Latvian Constitution of 1922 and to international law and therefore unlawful and that the Republic of Latvia had continued to exist de jure. Accordingly, the applicant's conduct in 1944 could and should have been analysed under Latvian and international law, rather than Soviet law. Further, the prosecution criticised the Regional Court's assessment of the evidence in the case. In its view, the court had relied on a series of assertions by the applicant that were unsupported by any evidence. This was true of the claims that the villagers from Mazie Bati were armed collaborators of the German administration who had helped the Wehrmacht to wipe out Chugunov's Partisans; that a “court” had been set up within the applicant's detachment; and that the real purpose of the Mazie Bati operation was not the summary execution of the villagers, but their arrest so they could be brought to trial. In the prosecution's submission, the evidence it had assembled tended to indicate the opposite. The prosecution complained that the Regional Court had accepted the applicant's depositions blindly without analysing the file as a whole.\", \"44.  In a judgment of 30 April 2004, the Criminal Affairs Division allowed the prosecution's appeal, quashed the impugned judgment and found the applicant guilty of the offence under Article 68-3 of the former Criminal Code. After reviewing the evidence referred to in the judgment of 21 January 2000 (see paragraph 36 above), it noted:\\n“... Thus, V. Kononov and the Partisans from the special group he commanded stole the weapons that had been delivered to enable the villagers to defend themselves and killed nine civilians from the village, burning six of them – including three women, one in the final stages of pregnancy – alive in the process. They also burnt down two farms.\\nBy attacking those nine civilians from the village of Mazie Bati, who had not taken part in the fighting, by stealing their weapons and killing them, V. Kononov and the Partisans under his command ... committed an appalling violation of the laws and customs of war as set out in:\\n– point (b) of the first paragraph of Article 23 of the Hague Convention of [18] October 1907 concerning the laws and customs of war on land, which is binding on all civilised nations and forbids the treacherous killing or wounding of members of the civil population; Article 25 [of the Hague Convention], which prohibits attacks by whatever means of villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefended; and the first paragraph of Article 46 [of the Hague Convention], which lays down that family honour and rights, and the lives of persons and private property must be respected.\\n– Article 3 § 1, point (a), of the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War ..., which lays down that persons taking no active part in the hostilities must not be subjected to violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; point (d) [of the same paragraph], which provides ... that the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples is prohibited; Article 32, which prohibits murder, torture and all other brutality against protected persons; and Article 33, which provides that no protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed and prohibits collective penalties, and all measures of intimidation, pillage and reprisals against protected persons and their property.\\n– Article 51 § 2 of the Protocol Additional to the [aforementioned] Convention and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts adopted on 8 June 1977 ..., which lays down that the civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack and prohibits acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population; § 4, point (a), [of the same Article], which prohibits indiscriminate attacks not directed at a specific military objective; § 6 [of the same Article], which prohibits attacks against the civilian population or civilians by way of reprisals; Article 75 § 2, point (a) ..., which prohibits violence to the life, health, or physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular, murder, torture of all kinds, whether physical or mental, and mutilation; and point (d) [of the same paragraph], which prohibits collective punishments.\\nBy acting with particular cruelty and brutality and burning a pregnant villager alive ..., V. Kononov and his Partisans openly flouted the laws and customs of war set out in the first paragraph of Article 16 of the Geneva Convention ..., which lays down that expectant mothers shall be the object of particular protection and respect.\\nLikewise, by burning down the [dwelling] houses and other buildings belonging to the villagers ... Meikuls Krupniks and Bernards Šķirmants, V. Kononov and his Partisans contravened the provisions of Article 53 of that Convention, which prohibits the destruction of real property except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations and Article 52 of the first Protocol Additional ... which lays down that civilian property must not be the object of attack or reprisals.\\n...\\nIn the light of the foregoing, the acts perpetrated by V. Kononov and his men must be classified as war crimes within the meaning of the second paragraph, point (b), of Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal for Nuremberg, which lays down that the murder or torture of civilians in occupied territory, the plunder of private property, the wanton destruction of villages, or devastation that is not justified by military necessity constitute violations of the laws or customs of war, that is to say war crimes.\\nThe acts perpetrated by V. Kononov and his Partisans must also be classified as 'grave breaches' within the meaning of Article 147 of the ... Geneva Convention...\\nConsequently ..., V. Kononov is guilty of the offence under Article 68-3 of the Criminal Code...\\n...\\nThe material in the case file shows that after the war, the surviving members of the families of the [people] killed were ruthlessly persecuted and subjected to reprisals. Following the restoration of Latvian independence, all those killed were rehabilitated. It was stated in their rehabilitation certificates that they [had] not committed 'crimes against peace [or] humanity, criminal offences ... or taken part ... in political repression ... by the Nazi regime'...\\n...\", \"45.  For the aforesaid reasons the Criminal Affairs Division found that the applicant's conduct on 27 May 1944 constituted a war crime, within the meaning of Article 68-3 of the former Criminal Code. However, it excluded from the grounds for the charge two allegations that had been made but not proved to the requisite standard by the prosecution, namely the alleged murders of Ambrozs Buļs and Bernards Šķirmants by the applicant (see paragraphs 17 and 20 above) and the torture to which he was alleged to have subjected the villagers. After finding the applicant guilty of a serious offence and noting that he was now aged, infirm and harmless, the Criminal Affairs Division imposed an immediate custodial sentence of one year and eight months, which the applicant was deemed to have served as he had spent longer than that in pre-trial detention.\", \"46.  The applicant appealed on points of law to the Supreme Court Senate, which dismissed his appeal in a judgment of 28 September 2004 in the following terms:\\n“... In finding that V. Kononov was a combatant and had committed the offence in question on the territory occupied by the USSR, the Criminal Affairs Division based its judgment on the decisions of the higher representative bodies of the Republic of Latvia, on the relevant international conventions and on other evidence, taken as a whole, which had been verified and assessed in accordance with the rules of criminal procedure.\\nIn the declaration by the Supreme Council ... on 4 May 1990 on the restoration of the independence of the Republic of Latvia, it was acknowledged that the ultimatum delivered on 16 June 1940 to the Government of the Republic of Latvia by the former Stalinist USSR should be regarded as an international crime, as Latvia was occupied and its sovereign power abolished as a result. [However] the Republic of Latvia continued to exist as a subject of international law, as was recognised by more than fifty States worldwide...\\n...\\nAfter analysing the merits of the judgment, the Senate ... considers that, to the extent that the Criminal Affairs Division found that V. Kononov came within the scope of Article 68-3 of the Criminal Code, ... his acts were correctly characterised, as, in his capacity as a belligerent and combatant on Latvian territory occupied by the USSR, he has violated the laws and customs of war, in that he planned and directed a military operation aimed at taking reprisals against civilians, namely peaceable inhabitants of the village of Mazie Bati, nine of whom were killed ... [and] whose property was stolen [or] burnt.\\nAs the court of appeal (rightly) noted, neither the fact that Latvian territory was subjected to two successive occupations in the Second World War by two States (one of which was Germany; a 'dual occupation' in the words of the court of appeal), nor the fact that the USSR was a member of an anti-Hitler coalition, changed V. Kononov's status as a person guilty of a war crime.\\nAs regards the allegation ... that, by finding V. Kononov guilty of the war crime in question the court [of appeal] violated the provisions of Article 6 of the Criminal Code ... concerning the temporal applicability of the criminal law, the [Senate] considers that it must be rejected for the following reasons.\\nThe judgment shows that the court of appeal applied the Conventions, namely the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 .., and [its] Protocol Additional of 8 June 1977 ..., to the war crime which V. Kononov was accused of, irrespective of when they entered into force. [This is consistent] with the United Nations Convention of 26 November 1968 on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity. [The court of appeal stated] that the Republic of Latvia, which had been occupied by the USSR, had not been able to take a decision [to that end] earlier. By referring to the principle of the non-applicability of statutory limitation, the court of appeal complied with the obligations arising under the international treaties and held the persons guilty of committing the offences concerned criminally liable irrespective of the date they were perpetrated.\\nSince the judgment characterised the violation of the laws and customs of war of which V. Kononov was accused as a war crime within the meaning of the second paragraph, point (b), of Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal for Nuremberg ..., and, ... by virtue of the aforesaid United Nations Convention of 26 November 1968 ..., war crimes ... are not subject to statutory limitation, ... the Senate finds that his acts were correctly found to come within Article 68-3 of the Criminal Code...\\nThere is no basis to the argument ... that ... the Declaration by the Supreme Council on 4 May 1990 on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia and the Declaration by Parliament on 22 August 1996 on the Occupation of Latvia were mere political pronouncements which the court was precluded from using as a basis for its judgment and which could not be given binding force retrospectively.\\nThe [Senate] finds that both declarations constitute State constitutional acts of indisputable legality.\\nIn its judgment, [delivered after] assessing the evidence examined at the hearing, [the court of appeal] found that, in his capacity as a combatant, V. Kononov organised, commanded and led a Partisan military operation intent on taking reprisals through the massacre of the civilian population of the village of Mazie Bati and the pillage and destruction of the villagers' farms. That being so, the court of appeal rightly found that the acts of individual members of his group ... could not be seen as [mere] excesses on the part of those concerned.\\nIn accordance with the criminal-law principles governing the responsibility of organised groups, members [of a group] are accomplices to the offence, independently of the role they play in its commission.\\nThis principle of responsibility of the members of an organised group is recognised in the third paragraph of Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal for Nuremberg, which lays down that leaders, organisers, instigators and accomplices participating in the execution of a common plan are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in the execution of that plan.\\nConsequently, the argument that the court of appeal had used an 'objective responsibility' test to find, in the absence of any evidence, V. Kononov guilty of acts perpetrated by members of the special group of Partisans he led, without examining his subjective attitude to the consequences, is unfounded. ...”\", '47.  On 4 May 1990 the Supreme Council adopted the Declaration of the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia and, on the same day, the Declaration on the Accession of the Republic of Latvia to Human Rights Instruments (Par Latvijas Republikas pievienošanos starptautisko tiesību dokumentiem cilvēktiesību jautājumos). The “accession” referred to in the declaration in practice meant a solemn, unilateral acceptance of the values embodied in the instruments concerned. Subsequently, most of the conventions referred to in the declaration were signed and ratified by Latvia in accordance with the established procedure.', '48.  On 22 August 1996 the Latvian Parliament adopted the Declaration on the Occupation of Latvia. The Declaration described the annexation of Latvian territory by the USSR in 1940 as a “military occupation” and an “illegal incorporation”. The Soviet repossession of the territory at the end of the Second World War was referred to as the “re-establishment of an occupying regime”.\\nIII.']","facts":"The applicant, born in 1923 in Latvia, initially held Latvian nationality before acquiring Russian citizenship in 2000. During World War II, as Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, he fled to Russia, joined the Soviet Army in 1942, and received training in sabotage operations. He was later promoted to sergeant. On 27 May 1944, he participated in an attack on the village of Mazie Bati, orchestrated by a Soviet commando unit called the \"Vilis Laiviņš,\" which he joined. The attack was a reprisal against villagers suspected of collaborating with German forces. During this assault, several villagers, including women, were killed, homes were burned, and properties were pillaged. Post-war, the applicant was honored in the USSR and joined the Communist Party. Latvia, upon restoring independence in 1991, later charged him in 1998 with war crimes related to these events. Although initially acquitted of war crimes but found guilty of banditry, conviction complexities involved issues of historical, legal interpretations of actions under Soviet versus Latvian laws during occupations. Eventually, the Latvian courts concluded that his actions constituted war crimes under international law, sentencing him but considering time served due to pre-trial detention. The case entwined with Latvia’s historical struggle with identity and legal continuity against Soviet dominion.","a":"In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the applicant could not reasonably have foreseen on 27 May 1944 that his acts amounted to a war crime under the jus in bello applicable at the time. There was, therefore, no plausible legal basis in international law on which to convict him of such an offence. Even supposing that the applicant has committed one or more offences under the general domestic law, their prosecution has long since become statute barred. Accordingly, domestic law could not serve as the basis for his conviction either.","b":"Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that the applicant was convicted under Article 148-1 § 7 of the Criminal Code, as worded since 13 January 1995, of tax offences which were committed in the period from 1993 to 1996. \nIt observes that the application of the criminal law of 13 January 1995 to subsequent acts is not at issue in the instance case. The question to be determined is whether the extension of the law to acts committed prior to that date infringed the guarantee set forth in Article 7 of the Convention.","c":"The Court, which is master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case, decided to examine the problem raised by the applicant under Article 7 of the Convention which is the relevant provision and which provides insofar as relevant as follows:\n“1.  No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.”","d":"At the outset, the Court reiterates that it is not its task to review in abstracto whether the retroactive application of the 2003 Code in war crimes cases is, per se, incompatible with Article 7 of the Convention. This matter must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the specific circumstances of each case and, notably, whether the domestic courts have applied the law whose provisions are most favourable to the defendant (see Scoppola, cited above, § 109).","label":"A","difficulty_signal_facts_len":0.5182926829,"difficulty_signal_context_len":0.4142427282,"difficulty_signal_option_similarity":0.1764348992,"difficulty_signal_overlap_ambiguity":0.9447808662,"difficulty_signal_negation_density":0.8522883741,"toughness_score":0.5645081256}

The children were initially placed under the temporary care of their uncle (the first applicant) and his wife (the second applicant). Later that year, the children's paternal grandparents also sought adoption. In December 1999, a court favored the grandparents' adoption request for both children, but this decision was overturned by the Supreme Court, requiring reevaluation.

The first applicant is a Lithuanian national who was born in 1966. The second applicant, his wife, is a Lithuanian national who was born in 1967. They live together in Mažeikiai and have two children.', '6.  In April 1999 the first applicant’s sister, SJ, and her partner, DŠ (senior), died, and the applicants were appointed as temporary custodians of the deceased couple’s daughters - RŠ, aged four, and DŠ, aged six months.', '7.  On an unspecified date in 1999 the paternal grandparents, SŠ and VŠ, applied to a court to adopt RŠ and DŠ. The applicants submitted a counter-claim for the adoption. On 22 December 1999 the Mažeikiai District Court accepted the grandparents’ claim, recognising RŠ and DŠ as their adopted children. On 27 March 2000 the Šiauliai Regional Court upheld that decision. On 14 June 2000 the Supreme Court quashed the lower decisions, remitting the case for a fresh examination at first instance.', '8.  On 17 July 2001 the Mažeikiai District Court partly granted the claim of SŠ and VŠ, by recognising DŠ (then two years) as their adopted daughter. However, it recognised RŠ (then six years old) as the adopted daughter of the applicants. The applicants and the grandparents were ordered by the court to ensure that there were no obstacles that would prevent RŠ and DŠ from communicating with the applicants as well as with their grandparents.', '9.  On 8 March 2002 the Šiauliai Regional Court quashed the decision, dismissing both adoption applications. The court considered that the dispute between the two couples could be resolved without an adoption, but by a grant of permanent custody.', '10.  On 28 August 2002 the Mažeikiai District Court appointed SŠ and VŠ as the permanent custodians of the two girls. The court reached this decision on account of the better financial and living conditions of the grandparents compared to the applicants, as well as the fact that SŠ and VŠ were closer blood relatives to the girls. Noting RŠ’s young age (then seven years old) and her “emotional instability” when expressing herself in front of officials, the court rejected her express wish to live with her “mother” and “father” (the applicants). The Mažeikiai District Court observed that a child’s wish does not necessarily coincide with its future interests; therefore the court was not bound by RŠ’s opinion. The court took note of the request of the Child Rights Protection Institution to give custody of the girls to the applicants, whom the girls recognised as their “natural family” and who had cared for them since their parents’ death. However, it concluded that the girls were of a young, adaptable age. As RŠ had lived with the applicants for a few years, without any memory of her grandparents’ family, she was unable to understand where she would be better off.', '11.  The applicants and the Child Rights Protection Institution appealed. On 4 November 2002 the Šiauliai Regional Court confirmed the first-instance reasoning and decision after a written procedure, without an oral hearing of the parties.', '12.  The applicants and the Child Rights Protection Institution lodged cassation appeals. On 8 November 2002 the President of the Supreme Court suspended the execution of the Mažeikiai District Court’s decision until the cassation appeal could be examined. On 12 February 2003 the Supreme Court held that it had no jurisdiction in child custody cases and dismissed the cassation application.', '13.  On 21 March 2003, when the bailiff attempted to execute the courts’ decision, RŠ refused to leave the applicants’ home to live with her grandparents. DŠ was taken to the grandparents.', '14.  On an unspecified date the Prosecutor General, defending the public interest, filed a request to reopen the proceedings. The Telšiai District Court reopened the civil proceedings and, on 8 October 2004, overruled the Mažeikiai District Court’s decision of 28 August 2002. The court granted permanent custody of RŠ to the applicants, who lived in Mažeikiai, and permanent custody of DŠ to the grandparents, who lived in Klaipėda. When deciding to separate the sisters, the court noted the wish of RŠ to stay with the applicants and the wish of DŠ to stay with her grandparents. The court also observed that, since March 2003, the girls had lived separately and were used to their current environments.', '15.  The grandparents appealed to the Šiauliai Regional Court, which on 22 November 2004 upheld the lower court’s decision. The appellate court was of the opinion that it had been reasonable for the first-instance court to take into consideration the interests of each child and not to consider them as an inseparable unit. The court noted that the children should be provided with the most suitable and best conditions to meet their personal interests in the most advantageous way. Therefore the court found that the principle of not separating siblings had been justifiably overruled. It also held that the principle of placing children within the family had not been violated. The court pointed out that it was not only blood ties which mattered when choosing placements, but also the individuals to whom the child felt closest.', '16.  On 6 June 2005 the Supreme Court gave a final ruling and upheld the decision of the Šiauliai Regional Court. Agreeing with the reasoning of the lower courts, it observed that during the initial proceedings the Mažeikiai District Court had made a mistake by not giving primary consideration to the wishes of RŠ. The Supreme Court also noted that the evidence in the case showed the existence of a conflict between the two guardianship families. It noted that proper conditions should be created so that the girls could communicate with each other, giving the primary importance of the children’s interests over those of their guardians. This was an obligation for the State authorities to fulfil.']","facts":"The case involves a dispute over the custody and adoption of two Lithuanian children, RŠ and DŠ, following the death of their parents in April 1999.

The couple's relationship ended in January 2008, leading the applicant to seek a divorce and custody of Yar B., with S.B. counterclaiming for custody. While proceedings were ongoing, S.B. took Yar B. from school on 24 February 2009, and the boy has been missing since. On 12 March 2009, the Novosibirsk Kalininskiy District Court finalized the divorce, granting custody of Yar B. to the applicant based on their close relationship and the ambiguity of Yar B.'s relationship with S.B., who had shown disinterest in the child's welfare. Despite the court's decision, S.B. withheld Yar B., prompting the applicant to pursue multiple legal avenues, including engaging the police, who initiated a local and federal search, and requesting the enforcement of the custody order, which faced procedural and enforcement issues. Throughout, S.B. evaded authorities while claiming Yar B. chose to live with him, despite a court order divesting S.B. of parental rights. Various attempts to institute criminal proceedings against S.B. for abducting Yar B. were repeatedly dismissed, citing either administrative offenses or lack of evidence, thus leaving the applicant separated from her son for several years.\nArguments: The applicant complained that the authorities had failed to enforce the judgment granting her custody of her son. The Court will examine this grievance under Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life ...\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”\nThe Government admitted that the judgment of 12 March 2009 granting the applicant custody of her son remained unenforced. They asserted, however, that the domestic authorities had applied, without undue delay, all the measures provided for by domestic law to have the above judgment enforced. The measures in question had been adequate and sufficient, and the competent domestic authorities had acted diligently to assist the applicant in execution of the judgment. The enforcement proceedings were still under way, as was the search for the applicant’s son, and enforcement of the judgment in question was still possible. There has therefore been no failure by the State to comply with its positive obligation to secure the applicant’s right to respect for her family life guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention.\nThe applicant challenged the Government’s submissions. In her opinion, the domestic authorities had failed to take all the measures that they could reasonably have been expected to take to enforce the judgment of 12 March 2009: they had limited themselves to giving formal replies to her complaints, without making any meaningful efforts to establish the child’s whereabouts. The applicant was astounded that while S. B. was questioned by the police on several occasions, had all along been actively exercising, personally and through representatives, his procedural and other rights by applying to the domestic authorities, and had been seen on several occasions in Novosibirsk by the applicant’s acquaintances, the domestic authorities had still been unable to trace him.\nContinuation options:\nA: The Court notes that these complaints are related to those that it has examined above and must therefore also be declared admissible. However, having regard to its finding under Article 9 of the Convention (see paragraph 53 above), the Court considers that there is no need to examine separately whether there has in the instant case been a violation of the other provisions relied upon by the applicant.\nB: In the light of all the material in its possession, the Court finds that these complaints do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. Accordingly, this part of the application must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded and declared inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.\nC: The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\nD: The Court notes that the applicant raised this issue before the Appeal Court, which examined it, even though it did not refer to it in its judgment.

It follows that this complaint must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.","context":"The applicant, born in 1975 and residing in Novosibirsk, married S.B. in 1997 and had a son, Yar B., in 2001. The couple's relationship ended in January 2008, leading the applicant to seek a divorce and custody of Yar B., with S.B. counterclaiming for custody. While proceedings were ongoing, S.B. took Yar B. from school on 24 February 2009, and the boy has been missing since. On 12 March 2009, the Novosibirsk Kalininskiy District Court finalized the divorce, granting custody of Yar B. to the applicant based on their close relationship and the ambiguity of Yar B.'s relationship with S.B., who had shown disinterest in the child's welfare. Despite the court's decision, S.B. withheld Yar B., prompting the applicant to pursue multiple legal avenues, including engaging the police, who initiated a local and federal search, and requesting the enforcement of the custody order, which faced procedural and enforcement issues. Throughout, S.B. evaded authorities while claiming Yar B. chose to live with him, despite a court order divesting S.B. of parental rights. Various attempts to institute criminal proceedings against S.B. for abducting Yar B. were repeatedly dismissed, citing either administrative offenses or lack of evidence, thus leaving the applicant separated from her son for several years.\n\nThe applicant complained that the authorities had failed to enforce the judgment granting her custody of her son. The Court will examine this grievance under Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life ...\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”\nThe Government admitted that the judgment of 12 March 2009 granting the applicant custody of her son remained unenforced. They asserted, however, that the domestic authorities had applied, without undue delay, all the measures provided for by domestic law to have the above judgment enforced. The measures in question had been adequate and sufficient, and the competent domestic authorities had acted diligently to assist the applicant in execution of the judgment. The enforcement proceedings were still under way, as was the search for the applicant’s son, and enforcement of the judgment in question was still possible. There has therefore been no failure by the State to comply with its positive obligation to secure the applicant’s right to respect for her family life guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention.\nThe applicant challenged the Government’s submissions. In her opinion, the domestic authorities had failed to take all the measures that they could reasonably have been expected to take to enforce the judgment of 12 March 2009: they had limited themselves to giving formal replies to her complaints, without making any meaningful efforts to establish the child’s whereabouts. The applicant was astounded that while S. B. was questioned by the police on several occasions, had all along been actively exercising, personally and through representatives, his procedural and other rights by applying to the domestic authorities, and had been seen on several occasions in Novosibirsk by the applicant’s acquaintances, the domestic authorities had still been unable to trace him.","reference_answer":"C","choices":["The Court notes that these complaints are related to those that it has examined above and must therefore also be declared admissible.

The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Novosibirsk.', '6.  In 1997 the applicant married S. B.', '7.  On 19 January 2001 the applicant gave birth to their son, Yar. B.', '8.  The couple ceased to have a relationship from January 2008 onwards.', '9.  On an unspecified date the applicant went to court seeking a divorce and custody of her son. S. B. lodged a counterclaim, also seeking custody of the child.', '10.  While the proceedings were still pending, on 24 February 2009 S. B. picked up Yar. B. from school, and the boy has not been seen since.', '11.  On 12 March 2009 the Novosibirsk Kalininskiy District Court granted the divorce and held that the boy should reside with the applicant, his mother. In taking this decision the court considered, among other relevant factors, the child’s strong affection for the applicant and the warm and trusting relationship which existed between them. The court established, on the other hand, that the child had an ambiguous relationship with his father S. B. Witness M., a child psychiatrist of the Novosibirsk Regional Children’s Psychoneurological Clinical Centre (Новосибирский областной детский клинический психоневрологический диспансер), submitted that she had seen Yar. B. on two occasions. In March 2008 the boy had been accompanied by both parents. The major complaints during the first visit were the child’s problems with speech, and appropriate medication was prescribed. During the second visit, in August 2008, the child was accompanied only by his mother. He submitted that he was worried about his parents’ divorce proceedings. He also said that his father S. B. hit him on the hands and shouted at him, and that he wanted his parents to be divorced. He submitted that he had sleeping problems and that he feared that when he fell asleep his father would come and take him away. M. found that the divorce proceedings were having an effect on the child: his stammering had worsened and he had become unhappy and fearful. She diagnosed the boy with childhood anxiety, phobic disorder and stammering, and recommended medication, sessions with a psychologist, and family therapy. It was further recommended that the child’s communication with his father be assessed and that the father be communicated with. The court further established that the boy had not lived with his father S. B. since August 2008. S. B. had not been paying the child support ordered by the court in August 2008. He had taken no interest in the child’s education. The Novosibirsk Regional Department of Education had been unable to get in touch with S. B., who was avoiding all contact. It had therefore been impossible to make a full assessment of the latter’s personality. The court expressed concern at the behaviour of S. B., who, knowing of the proceedings pending, deliberately changed the child’s place of residence by abducting him, and had been hiding the child ever since, thus disrupting the latter’s usual lifestyle and preventing the child from communicating with his mother. S. B. acted through his representative in the proceedings.', '12.  On 30 March 2009 the judgment entered into force. A writ of execution was issued.', '13.  On 20 November 2009 the Kalininskiy District Court refused to hear an appeal lodged by S. B. against the judgment of 12 March 2009.', '14.  Following the disappearance of her son Yar. B. with his father S. B. on 24 February 2009, on 26 February 2009 the applicant applied to the Novosibirsk Zayeltsovskiy District Department of the Interior (Управление внутренних дел по Заельцовскому району г. Новосибирска, “the Zayeltsovskiy District UVD”). The application was assigned to the inspector with responsibility for children and young people (инспектор отдела по делам несовершеннолетних) of the Zayeltsovskiy District UVD, who, in the absence at the material time of a court decision determining the child’s residence with one or other of the parents, did not find any evidence that Yar. B. had disappeared. At the same time, having found in the actions of S. B. indications of an offence under Article 330 of the Criminal Code (“taking the law into one’s own hands”), the inspector referred the application first to the Kalininskiy District Court and subsequently to the Zayeltsovskiy District Court, from where it returned without any judicial decision.', '15.  Following the judgment of the Kalininskiy District Court of 12 March 2009 (see paragraph 11 above), on 17 June 2009 the applicant requested the Novosibirsk Kalininskiy District Department of the Interior (Управление внутренних дел по Калининскому району г. Новосибирска, “the Kalininskiy District UVD”) to institute a search for Yar. B. The applicant’s request was referred to the Zayeltsovskiy District UVD.', '16.  On 25 June 2009 the Zayeltsovskiy District UVD opened a search file in respect of Yar. B. A local and federal search for him was launched. An alert (ориентировкa) with photographs of Yar. B. was sent to local offices of the Department of the Interior of Novosibirsk Region and to the neighbouring regions. The media were notified. An alert with a photograph of Yar. B. was posted on the website of the Novosibirsk Regional Chief Department of the Interior (Главное Управление внутренних дел по Новосибирской области, “the Novosibirsk Regional GUVD”). The Ministry of the Interior, the Chief Department of the Interior, the Departments of the Interior of the Russian Federation and the Departments of the Interior of the regions bordering the Republic of Kazakhstan were warned to check any available information on Yar. B. in the registers of medical insurance funds and education departments. The police also questioned the deputy head teacher of the school from which Yar. B. was picked up by S. B. on 24 February 2009, who submitted that (on an unspecified date) Yar. B.’s grandfather, N. B., had asked for a copy of the boy’s school medical record, without explaining why he needed it. Yar. B.’s classmates were also questioned. These measures yielded no results.', '17.  According to the Government, throughout the search for Yar. B., S.B. had persistently avoided communication with the police officers in charge of the search. He was, however, on several occasions brought to the police station and questioned there.', '18.  Specifically, on 19 October 2009 S. B. was brought in to the Zayeltsovskiy District UVD. During the questioning he confirmed that Yar. B. lived with him, but refused to divulge the child’s whereabouts, since he considered the judgment of 12 March 2009 unlawful and planned to lodge an appeal. He further submitted that the applicant was not a fit person to bring up Yar. B.', '19.  On 29 October 2009 S. B. was again questioned at the Zayeltsovkiy District UVD. He pledged that he would return the child to the applicant if he lost his appeal against the judgment of 12 March 2009.', '20.  On 5 July 2010 S. B. was brought in to the Novosibirsk Regional GUVD for questioning. However, he refused to make a statement in the absence of his lawyer. He limited himself to saying that the child lived with him, and promised to appear at the GUVD the following day accompanied by his lawyer. He did not do so.', '21.  The applicant stated that S. B. had been seen in the company of three police officers of the Novosibirsk UVD at the applicant’s office at 40‑39 Koroleva Street on 22 December 2010. However, when he was seen by employees there he left immediately. The Government did not dispute this.', '22.  The applicant stated that S. B. had been apprehended by the Dzerzhinskiy District Economic Crimes Bureau, Novosibirsk, on an unspecified date in March 2011, but that no enforcement action had been taken in this connection by the bailiff because of lack of cooperation between the Bailiffs’ Service and the police. The Government did not dispute this either.', '23.  Since no information could be retrieved from S. B. as to the whereabouts of Yar. B., the search for the child was being carried out through a series of operational-search measures in accordance with the Operational-Search Activities Act (Law no. 144-FZ of 12 August 1995).', '24.  According to the Government, at the time their observations were submitted in November 2011 the police were looking for Yar. B. in Omsk or northern Kazakhstan, since it had become known to them that S. B. travelled occasionally to Omsk. In this connection, S. B. and Yar. B.’s names were being regularly checked for in the records of the West Siberian Transport Department of the Interior (Западно-Сибирское Управление внутренних дел на транспорте). No information, however, had been received to date about any movements by them on air or railway transport.', '25.  The Government further submitted that the search for Yar. B. was under the control of the Zayeltsovskiy District Prosecutor’s Office, the Novosibirsk Regional Prosecutor’s Office and the Novosibirsk Regional Chief Department of the Interior. The search file was being regularly inspected by those bodies, and instructions had been given to the police as to the conduct of various specific operational-search measures, all of which had been complied with. The Government asserted that the search for Yar. B. was continuing, and would continue until the child was found.', '26.  On 21 May 2009, 29 January and 17 February 2010 the applicant complained to the head of the Novisibirsk Regional GUVD, claiming that the Zayeltsovskiy and the Kalininskiy District UVDs had not been searching actively for her son Yar. B. and her former husband S. B. According to the Government’s submissions, additional measures were taken in response to the applicant’s complaints to make the search more active; operational-search measures were also conducted and additional alerts and enquiries sent out. The response to the complaint of 17 February 2010 further mentioned that no shortcomings had been disclosed in the organisation and conduct of the search.', '27.  Following the applicant’s enquiry of 19 October 2010, on 1 December 2010 the Novosibirsk UVD informed the applicant that the following operational-search measures had been taken to establish the whereabouts of Yar. B.: sending requests to the Novosibirsk Regional Medical Insurance Fund, the Novosibirsk Regional Ministry of Health, Education, Culture, Sport and Youth Policy, and the Novosibirsk Regional Pension Fund; operational-search activities in Altay Region were also planned.', '28.  After a failed attempt to induce S. B. to comply with the judgment of 12 March 2009 voluntarily, on 29 October 2009 the applicant applied to the Kalininskiy District Bailiffs’ Service for institution of enforcement proceedings.', '29.  On 3 November 2009, however, the Bailiffs’ Service refused to open enforcement proceedings, taking the view that the operative part of the judgment did not contain an obligation for a debtor to pay a creditor, hand over any belongings, or take or refrain from taking any specific actions.', '30.  Following an appeal by the applicant to the District Court against the refusal to open enforcement proceedings, on 15 January 2010 the Bailiffs’ Service opened enforcement proceedings. A copy of the above decision was sent to S. B. at 35\/1-97 Obyedineniya Street in Novosibirsk. A five-day time-limit was set for S. B. to comply voluntarily with the judgment of 12 March 2009. He was warned that failure to do so in the absence of any valid reason would amount to an obligation to pay an execution fee and, in accordance with Section 113 of the Federal Law \"On Enforcement Proceedings\", might result in administrative responsibility under the Code of Administrative Offences. On the same day the bailiff submitted to the District Court a request for clarification of the provisions contained in the writ of execution.', '31.  On 17 February 2010 the bailiff took a decision to bring S. B., who was presumed to be living at 60-38 O. Zhilina Street, to the Kalininskiy District Bailiffs’ Service.', '32.  On 27 February 2010 the bailiff visited S. B.’s presumed place of residence at 60-38 O. Zhilina Street. The door was opened by N. B., who submitted that his son S. B. did not live at this address and that the latter’s whereabouts were not known to him.', '33.  On 18 March 2010 the District Court clarified the manner in which the judgment of 12 March 2009 was to be enforced. The court held that the bailiff should send a copy of the decision of 15 January 2010 on institution of enforcement proceedings to S. B. and set him a five-day time-limit for voluntary enforcement of the judgment. It further held that if S. B. refused to comply with the judgment voluntarily without a valid excuse, the judgment should be enforced by taking the applicant’s child from his father and any third persons and handing him over to his mother.', '34.  On 15 April 2010 the Bailiffs’ Service received the clarifications provided by the court. On the same day the bailiff established that search files had been opened by the police in respect of the debtor S. B. and the minor Yar. B., and enquiries had been sent to operational-search unit no. 1 of the Novosibirsk Regional Department of the Interior (GUVD) for confirmation of the above information and the results. The bailiff was informed that a search file had been opened in respect of Yar. B. by Zayeltsovkiy District UVD, and that no search file had been opened in respect of S. B. but that the latter had been placed on a wanted list. The bailiff issued a report of a missing child. The search was delegated to Novosibirsk no. 4 UVD.', '35.  On the same day the bailiff visited S. B.’s presumed place of residence at 35\/1-97 Obyedineniye Street. It became clear that no one had lived at the address in question for a long time. The enforcement proceedings were stayed.', '36.  On 13 May 2010 Novosibirsk no. 4 UVD returned the search materials to the bailiff because the search was being conducted by the Zayeltsovskiy District UVD.', '37.  On 15 September 2010 the bailiff again took a decision to bring S. B., who was presumed to be living at 60-38 O. Zhilina Street, to the Kalininskiy District Bailiffs’ Service, but it was not possible to put this decision into effect.', '38.  On 29 September 2010 the Kalininskiy District Bailiffs’ Service terminated the enforcement proceedings.', '39.  On 30 September 2010 the enforcement material was referred to the Tsentralniy District Bailiffs’ Service.', '40.  Following complaints by the applicant, on 11 October 2010 the prosecutor of the Kalininskiy District of Novosibirsk informed the President of the Kalininskiy District Court that the District Court had breached the procedural time-limit for clarification of the manner in which the judgment of 12 March 2009 should be enforced.', '41.  Furthermore, on 14 October 2010 the Novosibirsk Kalininskiy District prosecutor lodged a submission (представление) with the head of the Kalininskiy District Bailiffs’ Service making representation against undue delays in taking proper measures to have the judgment of 12 March 2009 enforced.', '42.  On 15 October 2010 the enforcement material was returned to the Kalininskiy District Bailiffs’ Service.', '43.  On 19 October 2010 the Kalininskiy District Bailiffs’ Service sent an inquiry to the Zayeltsovkiy District UVD about the results of the search for Yar. B. It further instructed the Tsentralniy District Bailiffs’ Service to visit S. B.’s presumed place of residence at 60-38 O. Zhilina Street.', '44.  On the same day the Tsentralniy District Bailiffs’ Service paid a visit to the flat at the Zhilina Street address. The door was opened by N. B., S. B.’s father, who submitted that S. B., although registered at that address since 2007, had never lived there. He further stated that he was unaware of his son’s whereabouts.', '45.  On 20 October 2010 the Kalininskiy District Bailiffs’ Service served a demand (требование) on N.B. to provide information about the whereabouts of S. B. and Yar. B. N.B. made a written statement that he did not have that information.', '46.  On 22 October 2010 the Kalininskiy District Bailiffs’ Service took a decision temporarily restricting S. B.’s right to leave the country. The enforcement proceedings were stayed.', '47.  On 28 January 2011 the applicant challenged the bailiff for inactivity and failure to enforce the judgment of 12 March 2009.', '48.  On 1 February 2011 the Kalininskiy District Bailiffs’ Service found no fault in the way the bailiff had handled the enforcement proceedings.', '49.  On 31 May 2011 the Dzerzhinskiy District Bailiffs’ Service restricted S. B.’s right to leave the country until 28 October 2011.', '50.  On 14 September 2011 enforcement proceedings were instituted in Omsk. A bailiff from the Kirovskiy District Bailiffs’ Service paid a visit to 27\/6-124 Komarova Street. The door was opened by N. Zh., S. B.’s aunt. She submitted that she had not seen S. B. for two years and that she was not aware of his and Yar. B.’s whereabouts. The bailiff also visited S. B.’s other possible place of residence at 82 5th Ostrovskaya Street. It was established that S. B. had neither been registered nor lived there.', '51.  On 30 September 2011 the enforcement proceedings in Omsk were terminated.', '52.  On an unspecified date in autumn 2011 enforcement proceedings were instituted by the Novosibirsk Regional Bailiffs’ Service. A visit was paid to another possible place of residence of S. B., at 35 Obskaya Street in Borovoye, Novosibirsk Region.', '53.  On 17 November 2011 the enforcement proceedings in Novosibirsk Region were terminated.', '54.  On 5 December 2011 the Kalininskiy District Bailiffs’ Service took a decision restricting S. B.’s right to leave the country until 29 May 2012.', '55.  On 29 December 2011 the Kalininskiy District Bailiffs’ Service terminated the enforcement proceedings and transferred the enforcement material to the special enforcement unit of the Novosibirsk Regional Bailiffs’ Service (отдел по исполнению особых исполнительных производств Управления Федеральной службы судебных приставов по Новосибирской области).', '56.  On 26 January 2012 the special enforcement unit of the Novosibirsk Regional Bailiffs’ Service instituted enforcement proceedings. A search for S. B. and Yar. B. was launched.', '57.  On 30 January 2012 a bailiff from the special enforcement unit visited S. B.’s presumed place of residence at 35 Obskaya Street in Borovoye, Novosibirsk Region. It was established that S.

On 31 July 2012 the enforcement proceedings were resumed.', '60.  On 1 August 2012 the special enforcement unit bailiff took a decision restricting S. B.’s right to leave the country until 1 February 2013. On the same day the enforcement proceedings were stayed.', '61.  On 13 August 2012 the special enforcement unit bailiff took a decision to halt the search for Yar. B. which had been ordered on 26 January 2012, because all the actions set out in the search plan had been taken. According to an overview of these activities taken on the same date (обзорная справка), it was established that Yar. B. was the subject of a federal search being carried out by the Zayeltsovskiy District UVD; that he was not studying in educational establishments, public or private, in Moscow, Moscow Region, Novosibirsk Region or Omsk Region; Yar.

On the same day the enforcement proceedings were stayed.', '63.  On 3 October 2012 the bailiff responsible for the search opened search files (розыскное дело) in respect of S. B. and Yar. B.', '64.  According to the information provided by the applicant on 30 April 2013, the judgment of 12 March 2009 remained unenforced to that date. The applicant submitted that she had not seen her son for several years.', '65.  The applicant persistently sought to have criminal proceedings instituted against S. B. after he abducted their son, Yar. B., on 24 February 2009.', '66.  On 2 July 2009 the Zayeltsovkiy District UVD referred the material on the disappearance of Yar. B. to the Zheleznodorozhniy Inter-District Investigation Department.', '67.  On 3 July 2009 the chief investigator of the Zheleznodorozhniy Inter-District Investigation Department refused to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the disappearance of Yar. B. under Article 24 § 1 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (lack of corpus delicti).', '68.  On 1 September 2009 the deputy head of the Zheleznodorozhniy Inter-District Investigation Department quashed the above decision and ordered an additional inquiry, to involve questioning of the applicant, S. B. and N. B. (S. B.’s father).', '69.  On 25 September 2009 the Zayeltsovkiy District UVD, having questioned the applicant and N. B., refused to institute criminal proceedings against S. B. under Article 330 § 1 of the Russian Criminal Code (see paragraph 104 below) with reference to Article 24 § 1 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, owing to the impossibility of questioning S. B.', '70.  On 15 November 2009 and 18 June 2010 the Zayeltsovkiy District UVD again refused to institute criminal proceedings against S. B. under Article 330 § 1 of the Russian Criminal Code, with reference to Article 24 § 1 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '71.  However, on 30 April and 18 June 2010 the Zayeltsovkiy District deputy prosecutor quashed the above decisions as unlawful and unjustified and ordered additional inquiries.', '72.  On 17 September 2010 the Zayeltsovkiy District Prosecutor lodged a submission (представление) with the head of the Zayeltsovkiy District UVD, making representation against undue delay in taking a decision on whether to institute criminal proceedings against S. B. under Article 330 § 1 of the Criminal Code, and seeking disciplinary sanctions against those responsible for the delay.', '73.  On 15 October 2010 the chief investigator of the Zayeltsovskiy Inter-District Investigation Department refused to institute criminal proceedings against S. B. under Article 105 § 1 of the Criminal Code (“murder”), due to the impossibility of locating S. B. or questioning him.', '74.

B. under Article 105 § 1 of the Criminal Code, and ordered an additional inquiry.', '75.  On 3 February 2011 the chief investigator of the Zayeltsovskiy Inter‑District Investigation Department refused to institute criminal proceedings against S. B. under Articles 105 and 126 of the Criminal Code (“murder” and “kidnapping”). The decision read as follows:\\n“... It follows from submissions by [S. B.] that his son, Yar. B., lives with [S. B.] by his own choice, [that he] is healthy and categorically refuses to live with [the applicant]. To support his submissions [S. B.] supplied photographs of his son and a CD with a video recording of him dated 25 January 2011.\\nThe preliminary inquiry established that Yar. B. is alive and is living with his father. Therefore, there is no corpus delicti in respect of Article 105 § 2 (c) of the Criminal Code. Due to the fact that under the Family Code the parents have equal rights and obligations in bringing up their children and that Yar.

B. under Article 330 § 1 of the Criminal Code.', '77.  On 13 July 2011, however, criminal proceedings against S. B. were terminated, with reference to Article 24 § 1 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It was held that the actions of S. B. amounted to an administrative offence under Article 5.35 § 2 of the Code of Administrative Offences (see paragraph 100 below) punishable by an administrative fine.', '78.  No administrative offence report was drawn up however in respect of S. B.', '79.  In response to a complaint by the applicant about this, on 7 September 2011 the Zayeltsovskiy District Prosecutor lodged an application with the Zayeltsovskiy District UVD, obliging it to draw up an administrative offence report.', '80.

In the meantime, on an unspecified date early in 2012 the Novosibirsk Kalininskiy District Prosecutor initiated court proceedings for termination of the parental rights of S. B.', '89.  On 14 February 2012 the District Court established that S. B. had abused his parental rights against the interests of Yar. B. by thwarting for over two years communication between the child and his mother, the applicant. It decided therefore to divest S. B. of his parental rights. S. B. acted through his representative in the proceedings.', '90.

While proceedings were ongoing, S.B. took Yar B. from school on 24 February 2009, and the boy has been missing since. On 12 March 2009, the Novosibirsk Kalininskiy District Court finalized the divorce, granting custody of Yar B. to the applicant based on their close relationship and the ambiguity of Yar B.'s relationship with S.B., who had shown disinterest in the child's welfare. Despite the court's decision, S.B. withheld Yar B., prompting the applicant to pursue multiple legal avenues, including engaging the police, who initiated a local and federal search, and requesting the enforcement of the custody order, which faced procedural and enforcement issues. Throughout, S.B. evaded authorities while claiming Yar B. chose to live with him, despite a court order divesting S.B. of parental rights. Various attempts to institute criminal proceedings against S.B. for abducting Yar B. were repeatedly dismissed, citing either administrative offenses or lack of evidence, thus leaving the applicant separated from her son for several years.","a":"The Court notes that these complaints are related to those that it has examined above and must therefore also be declared admissible.

The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Moscow.', '6.  On 28 September 2005 the applicant bought a 37.5 square metres flat in Moscow at 59 Novocheryomushkinskaya Street (“the flat”) and has been living there with her son born in 1998. The seller of the flat, Mr V., had bought it from Ms Ye., who had acquired it under the privatisation scheme. The facts relating to the ownership of the flat prior to the applicant’s acquisition of it and the subsequent invalidation of her title may be summarised as follows.', '7.  Before its privatisation the flat was owned by the City of Moscow. On 10 September 2004 the prefect of Yugo-Zapadnyy circuit allocated the flat to Mr M. as social housing. M. signed a social tenancy contract on 29 October 2004 and was registered as the flat’s principal, and only, tenant on 12 November 2004. No family members were indicated in the moving-in order.', '8.  On 19 November 2004 the Department of the Interior of the Cheryomushki District of Moscow registered M.’s spouse Ye. at his address. The registration was effected upon M.’s written application, certified by public notary R. on 17 November 2004, and accompanied by Ye.’s and M.’s marriage certificate issued in Kaluga on 15 October 2004. Ye.’s identity was confirmed upon presentation of her passport.', '9.  On 19 December 2004 M. was found dead. The inquest found that he had fallen out of the window of his flat and concluded that he had committed suicide, as no evidence of any other person’s involvement could be found. It was noted that M. was a former drug addict.', '10.  On 11 February 2005 Ye. issued a power of attorney to L., authorising him to represent her in all transactions related to the flat and in all privatisation and registration procedures before the property and residence registration authorities. The power of attorney was certified by public notary S., who had indicated in a standard clause that Ye. had signed the authority in her presence and that her identity and legal capacity had been confirmed.', '11.  On 30 March 2005 the Housing Policy and Housing Fund Department of the City of Moscow (Департамент жилищной политики и жилищного фонда г. Москвы, “the Moscow Housing Department”) concluded a social tenancy contract with Ye. and on the same day signed a privatisation agreement in respect of the flat. Ye. was represented by L. in these transactions.', '12.  On 6 May 2005 the Moscow Office of the Federal Authority for Registration of Property (Главное управление Федеральной регистрационной службы по г. Москве) registered Ye.’s ownership of the flat in the Consolidated State Register of Real Estate Titles and Transactions (Единый государственный реестр прав на недвижимое имущество и сделок с ним, “the Land Register”).', '13.  On 23 May 2005 Ye. sold the flat to V. On 6 June 2005 V.’s ownership was registered in the Land Register.', '14.  On 28 September 2005 V. sold the flat to the applicant. The terms of the purchase included the applicant’s obligation to pay the seller 990,000.00 Russian roubles (RUB) in respect of the flat, an advance payment of 6,000 United States dollars (USD), plus a contribution of RUB 1,465,847 to renovation costs. It also included an undertaking by the seller to buy the applicant an equivalent flat in the event that the applicant lost the title for reasons relating to any defects of the title which pre-dated the purchase of the flat by the applicant.', '15.  The transfer of title was registered at the Moscow Office of the Federal Authority for the Registration of Property.', '16.  The applicant and her son moved into the flat and have been living there since.', '17.  On 3 May 2007 Ye. died, reportedly of natural causes.', '18.  On 30 January 2008 the Moscow Department of the Interior informed the Moscow Housing Department of suspected fraud in the privatisation of the flat.', '19.  On an unidentified date in 2008 the Moscow Housing Department brought an action against the applicant and the previous owners of the flat V. and Ye. They referred to a “check” that had revealed that no marriage had taken place between M. and Ye. and that Ye.’s passport used for the registration and privatisation procedures had been declared lost in 1996; they asked the court to establish that the flat had been fraudulently acquired by Ye. and to declare the privatisation and all the ensuing transactions in respect of the flat null and void. The applicant lodged a counterclaim to have her title to the flat recognised by the court.', '20.  On 25 July 2008 the Cheryomushkinskiy District Court of Moscow dismissed the authorities’ claim and granted the applicant’s counterclaim, recognising her as the legitimate owner of the flat. It noted, in particular, that the applicant had purchased the flat in good faith (a bona fide buyer) and paid a purchase price for it. Therefore there were no grounds to invalidate the transactions in question. No appeal was lodged within the ten-day statutory limitation period, and the judgment became final and enforceable.', '21.  On 11 August 2008 the applicant complained to the police that Mr A.B., an official at the Moscow Housing Department, was trying to extort USD 50,000 from her in return for a promise that the Department would not appeal against the judgment of 25 July 2008. On 12 August 2008 the police carried out a covert operation, during which A.B. was caught receiving the aforementioned sum of money from the applicant, who had been primed by the police. On 10 December 2008 A.B. was convicted of embezzlement on account of that episode, and received a custodial sentence.', '22.  In the meantime, the Moscow Housing Department submitted a request for an extension of the time-limit for appeal against the judgment of 25 July 2008, on the grounds that the prosecution of A.B., who had been in charge of the file, left the Department understaffed and unable to comply with the deadlines. On 14 November 2008 the District Court granted the request and extended the time-limit for the appeal. The appeal hearing took place on 18 December 2008 before the Moscow City Court, which quashed the judgment and remitted the matter back to the District Court for a fresh first-instance examination. It instructed the first-instance court to clarify whether the claims concerned the invalidation of the transactions regulated by Article 167 of the Civil Code, or the reclaiming of property under Article 302 of the Code.', '23.  On 15 December 2008 criminal proceedings against an “unidentified perpetrator” were instituted on suspicion of fraud in the process of privatisation of the flat. The applicant requested to be granted victim status in these proceedings, but this was refused on the grounds that the damage resulting from the fraud was caused to the Moscow Housing Department, not to the applicant. The decision refusing the applicant victim status was taken by the Moscow City Court on 27 July 2009.', '24.  On 9 July 2009 the District Court found that the privatisation of the flat by Ye. had been fraudulent. It established, in particular, that the civil act registration authority had found no record of a marriage between M. and Ye. and concluded that their marriage certificate had been forged. Therefore Ye. had had no right to be registered at M.’s address or to privatise his flat after his death. In respect of the applicant, it found that she was a bona fide buyer, within the meaning of Article 302 of the Civil Code. However, it found that the flat, having been fraudulently privatised, had left the possession of the City of Moscow, its lawful owner, without that body having the intention to divest itself of it. Thus, by application of Article 302 of the Civil Code and Constitutional Court ruling 6-P of 21 April 2003, the case fell under one of the two exceptions to the protection of a bona fide buyer’s title, which required that precedence be given to the previous owner. The applicant’s title to the flat was accordingly revoked and the City of Moscow declared the flat’s lawful owner. The court ordered the applicant’s eviction without compensation or an offer of alternative housing. The applicant appealed.', '25.  On 21 December 2009 the Moscow City Ombudsman wrote to the Mayor of Moscow, asking him to consider offering the applicant a social tenancy of the flat. However, on 19 January 2010 the Moscow Housing Department replied in the negative, stating that this would undermine the order of priority on the waiting list.', '26.  On 12 February 2010 the investigating authority decided to grant the applicant victim status in the criminal proceedings and questioned her in this capacity. On 23 March 2011, however, they overruled that decision as unfounded, following an order by the prosecutor that they should do so.', '27.  The criminal investigation of the suspected fraud was then suspended on the grounds that no culprit had been identified. The file, however, contained certain material on the basis of which the courts were able to establish that the privatisation had been carried out improperly. It included, in particular, the finding that all acts relating to Ye.’s registration as a resident of the flat, its privatisation and sale to V. had been carried out using Ye.’s passport, which had been declared lost in 1996. It also contained a reply from the municipal authorities of Kaluga that they had no record of Ye.’s and M.’s marriage having been registered in 2004. The Kaluga passport authorities had replied to the investigator that Ye. had been previously registered as a resident of Kaluga, and her registration there had not been removed until her death in 2007. There was also a reply from public notary R. that she had had no records of M.’s application in her register and she denied having certified it.', '28.  On 13 May 2010 the appeal against the judgment of 9 July 2009 was rejected in the final instance by the Moscow City Court.', '29.  The applicant requested a suspension of the execution of the judgment in so far as it concerned the eviction. On 22 July 2010 the court granted her request and adjourned the eviction until 1 February 2011. This term was later extended until 1 June 2011.', '30.  On 14 December 2010 the Deputy Prosecutor General requested the Supreme Court to examine the applicant’s case in supervisory review proceedings. He considered the revocation of her ownership of the flat unlawful and unjustified. First, he argued that the rule contained in Article 302 § 1 of the Civil Code ordering reinstatement of ownership of the property which was removed from its owner’s possession without the owner’s intention to divest itself of it was inapplicable in her case. He pointed out that the Moscow Housing Department was a party to the transaction in which the flat had been privatised and could not be unaware of it; the Department had never claimed that the official in charge of the privatisation had gone beyond her authority or acted contrary to instructions. Hence it could not be said that the flat had been privatised without the Department having that intention. Therefore, the applicant, as a bona fide buyer, should not have been required to return the flat to its earlier owner, the City of Moscow. Secondly, the Deputy Prosecutor General considered that the judicial decisions had not balanced the interests of the municipality against the lawful rights and interests of the applicant, whereas the protection of individual citizens should have taken priority, in accordance with the Constitution. As a result of a third-party fraud, a single mother and her child faced eviction without compensation and without an offer of alternative housing. He noted that she had no other housing and that all her savings had been put into the purchase of the flat and the costly litigation. Finally, he pointed out that the courts had exceeded their responsibility in applying Article 302 of the Civil Code, in lieu of Article 167 on which the plaintiff had relied, and had thereby granted the award beyond the scope of the claim.', '31.  On 24 December 2010 the Supreme Court refused the request by the Deputy Prosecutor General, declining to reconsider the case in supervisory-review proceedings. It noted that the applicant’s status as a bona fide buyer had not been in doubt at any stage. However, the courts had correctly applied the law and granted the plaintiff’s lawful claims. It added that the applicant remained free to sue V. for damages.', '32.  On 31 May 2011 the Cheryomushkinskiy District Court of Moscow rejected the applicant’s application for further suspension of the execution of the judgment of 9 July 2009, noting that there had already been two extensions and there were no grounds for another.', '33.  On 30 June 2011 the Moscow City Ombudsman wrote to the Mayor of Moscow, alerting him to a growing number of cases of flats being repossessed by the City of Moscow against bona fide buyers on account of irregular privatisation by the previous owners of the flats; all of them were being denied any compensation or substitute housing. In his view, the incidents of fraudulent privatisation should not have been treated by courts as cases where property was removed from possession “without the owner’s intention to divest” within the meaning of Article 302 § 1 of the Civil Code. He pointed out that privatisations were transactions entered into by the State, represented by its public officials, whose duty was to make all the necessary checks and to ensure the procedural integrity of the transaction. The responsibility of the State was thus engaged wherever they failed in this task. In any event, failure to identify documents as forged could not in such circumstances be classified as passage of title without the owner’s intention to divest. He referred to the applicant’s case as one flagrant example of a wrong and unjust outcome of the erroneous interpretation adopted by Moscow courts in such cases. On the same day he sent letters to the Moscow Prosecutor’s Office and the head of the Moscow Department of the Interior, citing the applicant’s case, calling for the thorough investigation of fraud cases of this type, and requesting that the applicant’s victim status be reassessed in the relevant criminal proceedings.', '34.  According to the applicant’s latest submissions, she has not yet been evicted but considers it imminent.']","facts":"The applicant, born in 1973 and residing in Moscow, purchased a 37.5 square meter flat in 2005 from Mr. V, who had acquired it from Ms. Ye. through a privatisation scheme.

The applicants were born in 1960 and 1956 respectively and live in Riga.', '6.  On an unspecified date the Bureau for the Prevention and Combating of Corruption (“the KNAB”) received information concerning allegedly unlawful activities of officials of the State Pharmacy Inspectorate. Aiming to verify that information, the KNAB launched operational proceedings (operatīvā izstrāde). In the context of those proceedings the second applicant, who at that time was the owner of a chain of pharmacies in Latvia, was summoned to the KNAB to give statements about the activities of certain State officials supervising pharmaceutical matters in Latvia.', '7.  According to the document (uzziņa) prepared by the Supreme Court on 27 July 2012 and addressed to the Government, on 10 March 2005 an operational measure – the interception of the second applicant’s telephone conversations – had been authorised until 12 May 2005. The document was based on “the Supreme Court’s register of special proceedings (lietvedība) relating to classified State secrets for the year 2005, Volume 13, entry no 2‑1264s of 19 March 2005”.', '8.  Upon being summoned by the KNAB, on 12 April 2005 the second applicant went to its offices, where he was questioned by two investigators, H. and J. Initially, he refused to cooperate and instead asked J. questions about his duties.', '9.  On 13 April 2005 the second applicant arranged a meeting with J. away from the KNAB’s offices. On the KNAB’s behalf, the meeting was organised as an undercover operation under section 15(3) of the Law on Operational Activities, and prior authorisation from a specially authorised prosecutor of the Prosecutor General’s Office was obtained.', '10.  On 13 and 14 April 2005 three meetings took place between the second applicant and J. During the second meeting, which was video and audio recorded by J., the second applicant offered J. a bribe in the amount of 50,000 Latvian lati (LVL) and monthly payments of LVL 1,000 in return for the cessation of any investigative activities concerning his business and the State officials connected with it. During the meeting the second applicant paid J. LVL 18,000 as a first instalment.', '11.  Meanwhile, the second applicant called the first applicant, who was a board member of the company he owned. He asked her to withdraw cash from the company’s account. He explained that the money would be spent on “protection”. Their phone conversations were intercepted and recorded.', '12.  The next day, the second applicant arranged another meeting, during which he gave the investigator LVL 27,000. On the same day he was arrested by KNAB officers.', '13.  After the second applicant’s meeting with J., on 13 April 2005 the KNAB instituted criminal proceedings for bribery. The second applicant was charged as a suspect. The charging decision was sent to the Prosecutor General’s Office so that the prosecution could commence.', '14.  On 22 April 2005 a prosecutor of the Prosecutor General’s Office questioned the second applicant. The second applicant pleaded guilty and stated that the payments had been intended to prevent further investigation into his business activities.', '15.  In a letter of 31 May 2005 the KNAB informed the supervising prosecutor at the Prosecutor General’s Office that the second applicant’s phone had been tapped in accordance with section 17(3) of the Law on Operational Activities “upon the authorisation of a judge of the Supreme Court”. The KNAB asked for the recordings to be included in the criminal case file.', '16.  On 2 June 2005 the Office of the Prosecutor brought a charge of aiding and abetting against the first applicant, and a charge of bribery against the second applicant.', '17.  On 30 June 2005 both applicants were questioned by a prosecutor of the Prosecutor General’s Office. The first applicant pleaded guilty.', '18.  On 12 July 2005, having studied the material in the criminal case file, the representative of the first applicant asked the prosecutor to disclose a document attesting to the lawfulness of the interception of the telephone conversations between both applicants. On the same day the supervising prosecutor dismissed that request, arguing that the decision to authorise interception of the telephone conversations of the applicant and other persons had been adopted under 17(3) of the Law on Operational Activities, and therefore was not a procedural document. Moreover, the document had been classified as a State secret. The prosecutor also argued that the existence of such authorisation had been confirmed by the KNAB, and that there were no grounds to question the validity of that confirmation. The first applicant did not appeal against that reply to a more senior prosecutor.', '19.  On 15 July 2005 the criminal case concerning both applicants was referred to a court.', '20.  It appears that on 18 October 2005 the representative of the first applicant sent a complaint about the activities of KNAB officials in relation to the phone tapping to the Prosecutor General’s Office. The prosecutor in charge replied that the phone tapping had been authorised by a judge of the Supreme Court, and that the KNAB had not infringed any provisions of the Law on Operational Activities. The prosecutor also stated that the information obtained as a result of the operational activities was open to assessment in the course of the criminal proceedings. The first applicant did not appeal against that reply to the Prosecutor General.', '21.  On 2 November 2005 the Riga City Vidzeme District Court, acting as a first-instance court and presided over by Judge B.T., acquitted the first applicant. The court found the second applicant guilty and gave him a suspended sentence of two years’ imprisonment. He pleaded guilty during the hearing, therefore the court proceeded without assessing the evidence.', '22.  On 8 November 2005 the prosecutor submitted an appeal contesting the acquittal of the first applicant, and asked for an immediate custodial sentence to be imposed in relation to the second applicant. He asked the appellate court to give a new judgment in respect of the parts of the original judgment which were contested. The second applicant submitted an appeal concerning the severity of his sentence.', '23.  Between 24 and 27 October 2006 the Riga Regional Court, acting as an appellate court, held several hearings during which the second applicant pleaded guilty. The representative of the first applicant submitted that the case file did not contain any information pertaining to the authorisation of the interception of phone conversations, which had been the main evidence against her. During the hearing, the prosecutor confirmed orally that judicial authorisation had been obtained.', '24.  On 31 October 2006 the appellate court adopted a judgment which upheld the prosecutor’s appeal and quashed the disputed parts of the lower court’s judgment. The appellate court found the first applicant guilty, giving her a suspended sentence of one year’s imprisonment. It also revoked the suspension of the second applicant’s prison sentence and he was taken directly to prison from the courtroom. The appellate court stated, inter alia, “the court recognises all the evidence in the criminal case as admissible, on the grounds that the factual information has been obtained and established (nostiprinātas) in line with procedure and in accordance with the order set out by law ...”.', '25.  In an appeal on points of law the first applicant argued that the tapped phone conversations should not have been admitted as evidence, as they had been obtained without proper authorisation. The second applicant submitted, inter alia, that the appellate court had not assessed the lawfulness of the phone tapping and had ignored the fact that the criminal case had contained no reference to any authorisation to carry out the above activity as prescribed by Article 176¹ of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In this regard, he also submitted that the appellate court had consequently failed to observe that interference in a person’s private life should be in accordance with the law, as required by Article 8 of the Convention.', '26.  On 19 January 2007 the Senate of the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on points of law in open court. In response to the Article 8 complaint, the Senate stated that the phone had been tapped “in accordance with section 17 of the Law on Operational Activities, and not as a special investigative measure under Article 176¹ of the Code of Criminal Procedure”.', '27.  Meanwhile, during a judges’ conference on 4 November 2005, the Minister of Justice stated in her opening speech:\\n“Today I would say that I, like the majority of you sitting in this hall, am powerless against the actions of our colleagues, which neither society nor I personally understand”.', '28.  A daily news report on 4 November 2005 mentioned that the minister had admitted to journalists that she had been referring to the judgment adopted by Judge B.T. in her speech (see paragraph 21 above):\\n“Yes, I am not authorised to comment on particular cases where the adjudication is still pending, but I consider that I have the right to express an opinion on behalf of other judges who carry out their work honestly.”']","facts":"The applicants, living in Riga and born in 1960 and 1956, became involved in a corruption investigation led by Latvia's Bureau for the Prevention and Combating of Corruption (KNAB), which received reports of unlawful activities by State Pharmacy Inspectorate officials.

The parties have not specified whether he would have been able to continue working for the Ministry of the Interior at a different position.', '10.  Despite having formally retired, after the expiry of the statutory time-limit of one year the applicant was allowed to undergo a fresh psychological assessment at the Institute, in relation to the preparation of a new international police mission. The new psychological assessment was conducted on 11 October 2002, and the Institute psychologists concluded once again that the applicant was psychologically unfit for the job. Thus, the applicant’s application to join the new mission was rejected.', '11.  The applicant complained of this outcome to the Minister of the Interior and other bodies, such as the parliamentary commission on internal security and public order and the President of the Republic. The human resources department of the Ministry of the Interior informed him, in a letter dated 29 January 2003, that the refusals to include him in the international contingents had been lawful.', '12.  On 12 February 2003 the applicant applied under the Protection of Personal Data Act (see paragraph 22 below) to receive access to the documents contained in his personnel file at the Ministry of the Interior. He argued that the file contained data which could be considered personal for the purposes of this Act, including “appraisals, the results of different tests, data from psychological assessments”.', '13.  In the subsequent administrative and judicial proceedings, as described below, the competent national authorities did not refer to any individual documents or a category of documents, but instead referred generally to the information sought by the applicant as “personal data” contained in his personnel file.', '14.  An initial refusal to allow him access to the file, signed by the head of the Ministry’s human-resources department and dated 2 April 2003, was quashed on 17 November 2003 by the Sofia City Court, as it had not been ordered by the competent body, namely the Minister of the Interior. This conclusion was upheld on 30 July 2004 by the Supreme Administrative Court.', '15.  On 31 January 2005 the Minister of the Interior issued a decision refusing the applicant access to his personnel file. He relied in general terms on the provisions of section 34(3) of the Protection of Personal Data Act and section 182(7) of the Ministry of the Interior Act, as in force at the time (see paragraphs 22 and 25 below).', '16.  This refusal was quashed by a three-member panel of the Supreme Administrative Court on 29 July 2005, on the grounds that it had not been reasoned, as it had merely referred to the provisions restricting access to personal data without explaining how they had been relevant to the circumstances of the case and without accounting for the applicant’s own right to access to data concerning him. On 15 August 2006 a five-member panel of the Supreme Administrative Court upheld these findings.', '17.  In a new decision dated 17 October 2006, the Minister of the Interior refused the applicant access to his personnel file at the Ministry. The Minister relied once again on section 34(3) of the Protection of Personal Data Act, as well as on section 161 of the Ministry of the Interior Act of 2006 (see paragraphs 22 and 26 below). He explained that personnel files of officers contained information on “the enquiries in respect of a person applying to be employed” at the Ministry and information revealing the Ministry’s “structures, positions and functions”. He noted that the first category of information was classed as an official secret, but at the same time mentioned that, in accordance with an internal instruction of the Ministry, officers’ personnel files had to be considered to contain information which was a State secret. It was explained further that even though personnel files also comprised documents which contained no sensitive information, owing to the presence of some classified documents the files had to be classified in their entirety.', '18.  The applicant applied for judicial review. He explained the circumstances in which he had left the Ministry of the Interior and that he had a “particularly strong interest” to get acquainted with his psychological assessments. He stated furthermore that his application for access to his personnel file concerned his “professional identity”. He argued that the Minister of the Interior had not duly taken into account his right to access to information, that there were no legal grounds to consider the information referred to in the decision as classified, and that in any event, seeing that the applicant had left the Ministry in 2002 and that the relevant time-limits for keeping classified documents representing official secrets had expired, any such documents in his file had had in the meantime to be declassified.', '19.  In a judgment of 25 March 2008 a three-member panel of the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the application for judicial review. It held that the Minister’s decision was well reasoned, and that the Minister had correctly considered that the information concerned was classified. It pointed out that even though personnel files of police officers also comprised documents which contained no sensitive information, they had to be classified in their entirety due to the presence of some classified documents.', '20.  Upon appeal by the applicant, in a final judgment of 8 July 2008 the judgment above was upheld by a five-member panel of the Supreme Administrative Court. It endorsed the three-member panel’s reasoning, adding that the declassification of documents could only occur after an express decision of the competent official, despite the expiry of the relevant time-limits.', '21.  In the proceedings before the Court the Government submitted copies of the applicant’s psychological assessments of September 2001 and October 2002. They bear no security markings.']","facts":"The applicant, born in 1954 and residing in Sofia, worked as a police officer from 1977 and participated in several international missions. In 2001, seeking a role as a police observer in a new mission, he underwent a psychological assessment which returned a negative result, barring him from the mission. Despite addressing concerns to the Ministry of the Interior's Psychology Institute, the assessment was deemed objective. After retiring in March 2002, the applicant underwent another psychological assessment in October 2002, which also concluded he was unfit. His attempts to gain access to his personnel file, under the Protection of Personal Data Act, were initially denied, deemed lawful, and classified as a state secret due to the sensitive nature of certain documents, despite the information being unmarked as secure. Subsequent appeals for access were rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court, upholding the notion that personnel files should remain classified in their entirety until explicitly declassified by the competent authorities, irrespective of the expiry of relevant time-limits for keeping official secrets.","a":"The Court reiterates that it is the master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of a case (see, for instance, Aksu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 4149\/04 and 41029\/04, § 43, ECHR 2012). In the present case, it considers that the applicant’s complaint concerns exclusively the remedies available to her against her stepfather, not those available against the State to enforce the substance of a Convention right or freedom at the national level. The complaint is therefore to be examined under Article 8 of the Convention alone, which provides as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”","b":"The Court considers that, having regard to the circumstances of the present case, her complaint falls to be examined under Article 8 of the Convention (see X v. Finland, no. 34806\/04, § 230, ECHR 2012 (extracts)), the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life ...\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”","c":"The Court is of the view that it suffices to examine the complaints under Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”","d":"The Court observes that the applicant’s requests for information concerned exclusively the question whether or not he had been subjected to secret surveillance. In those circumstances, the Court considers that his complaint in respect of the refusals to provide him such information falls to be examined as an aspect of his broader grievance concerning the lack of sufficient safeguards against unjustified interferences with his rights under Article 8 of the Convention. Article 8 provides, in so far as relevant:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life ... and his correspondence.\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”","label":"C","difficulty_signal_facts_len":0.2926829268,"difficulty_signal_context_len":0.0341023069,"difficulty_signal_option_similarity":1.0,"difficulty_signal_overlap_ambiguity":0.9712228968,"difficulty_signal_negation_density":0.4565010305,"toughness_score":0.542710927}

In January 2014, the couple decided to separate, and on January 14, 2014, R.M. took the children to Republic of Ingushetiya without informing the applicant, leaving them with his parents. The marriage was dissolved on March 4, 2014, after which the applicant sought a residence order for the children and child maintenance from R.M. The Moscow District Court ruled in her favor on June 25, 2014, ordering the children to live with her and R.M. to pay maintenance, but R.M. refused to comply, prompting lengthy and complex enforcement proceedings. Various enforcement attempts failed due to the emotional state of the children, the applicant's absence, or misunderstandings regarding notification. Despite multiple fines and restrictions imposed on R.M. by bailiffs and courts, he continued to ignore the court order, and the children remain with their paternal grandparents to date, with the judgment remaining unenforced.\nArguments: The applicant complained that the authorities had failed to enforce the judgment of 25 June 2014 granting her a residence order in respect of her children. She relied on Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life ...\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”\nThe Government asserted that the domestic authorities had taken all the necessary steps that they could reasonably have been expected to take to enforce the judgment of 25 June 2014. However, their efforts had been unsuccessful. They considered that the applicant had prevented the enforcement herself as, despite having been duly notified of the scheduled enforcement dates, she had repeatedly failed to attend. The removal of the children and their transfer could not take place in her absence. The Government concluded that the State had complied with its positive obligation to ensure the applicant’s right to respect for her family life under Article 8 of the Convention and that there had therefore been no violation of that Convention provision.\nThe applicant challenged the Government’s assertion that the domestic authorities had taken all necessary steps to facilitate the reunion between her and the children. She considered that throughout the enforcement proceedings the bailiffs had failed to display due diligence in handling her calls for assistance. They had appeared unprepared to face the task and had had no clear idea or action plan as to what could and should be done. As a result, the children continued to live with their parental grandparents instead of either parent. The applicant submitted that she had been present for all the enforcement attempts of which she had been duly and properly notified, namely 23 March, 2 April and 16 April 2015, except for the enforcement planned for 14 April 2015. She had been absent on that date due to illness. She had not been informed of any other enforcement dates. The case file contains no evidence to the contrary. The applicant further deplored the bailiffs’ conduct during the enforcement proceedings (see paragraph 21 above), the delay in transferring the enforcement file from the Republic of Ingushetiya back to Moscow pursuant to the District Court’s decision of 8 April 2015, and the failure to properly notify her of the enforcement dates, which rendered the enforcement measures completely useless. The total amount of administrative fines imposed on R.M. for his failure to comply with the judgment of 25 June 2014 was too small to be capable of inducing him to comply with the bailiffs’ demands. Besides, none of the fines had actually been recovered from him. Bailiffs from the Izmaylovskiy District Bailiffs’ Service in Moscow should have exercised their right under section 33(10) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act to travel to Ingushetiya to facilitate enforcement of the judgment rather than sending requests for assistance to the Sunzhenskiy District Bailiffs’ Service in the Republic of Ingushetiya, which was clearly biased against the applicant and not predisposed to enforcing the judgment in her favour. The latter allegation was supported by references to unlawful actions by the bailiffs of that Bailiffs’ Service, as well as by the existence of a common phenomenon in cases concerning custody decisions from Chechnya and Ingushetiya.\nContinuation options:\nA: The Court notes that these complaints are related to those that it has examined above and must therefore also be declared admissible. However, having regard to its finding under Article 9 of the Convention (see paragraph 53 above), the Court considers that there is no need to examine separately whether there has in the instant case been a violation of the other provisions relied upon by the applicant.\nB: In the light of all the material in its possession, the Court finds that these complaints do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. Accordingly, this part of the application must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded and declared inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.\nC: The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\nD: The Court notes that the applicant raised this issue before the Appeal Court, which examined it, even though it did not refer to it in its judgment. Considering that the applicant has not further substantiated his claim, the Court finds no indication of any violation in this respect. It follows that this complaint must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.","context":"The applicant, born in 1985 and residing in Moscow, married R.M. in May 2008, with whom she had two children born in July 2008 and May 2012.

On 5 February 2016 the chief bailiff of the Izmaylovskiy District Bailiffs’ Service imposed an administrative fine on R.M. of RUB 1,000 for failure to comply with the lawful demands of the bailiffs.', '38.  On 13 April 2016 the bailiff telephoned R.M. and asked him to attend the bailiffs’ office to provide explanations for his non-compliance with the judgment of 25 June 2014. He refused to do so.', '39.  On 14 April 2016 the bailiff suspended the enforcement proceedings.', '40.

It appears from the case file that the notification of 5 May 2016 was sent to R.M.’s address.', '43.  The judgment of 25 June 2014 remains unenforced to date.

In January 2014, the couple decided to separate, and on January 14, 2014, R.M. took the children to Republic of Ingushetiya without informing the applicant, leaving them with his parents. The marriage was dissolved on March 4, 2014, after which the applicant sought a residence order for the children and child maintenance from R.M. The Moscow District Court ruled in her favor on June 25, 2014, ordering the children to live with her and R.M. to pay maintenance, but R.M. refused to comply, prompting lengthy and complex enforcement proceedings. Various enforcement attempts failed due to the emotional state of the children, the applicant's absence, or misunderstandings regarding notification. Despite multiple fines and restrictions imposed on R.M. by bailiffs and courts, he continued to ignore the court order, and the children remain with their paternal grandparents to date, with the judgment remaining unenforced.","a":"The Court notes that these complaints are related to those that it has examined above and must therefore also be declared admissible.

Shortly after taking office, he controversially granted Lithuanian citizenship to a Russian businessman, J.B., which was later challenged for breaching the Constitution. The Constitutional Court found that the decree violated the Constitution as J.B. had no exceptional merits justifying such a grant and had financially supported the applicant’s election campaign. Furthermore, the Court noted that the applicant acted under J.B.'s influence, disclosed state secrets, and exercised inappropriate influence over a private company. The Seimas initiated impeachment proceedings, and the Constitutional Court confirmed the applicant had grossly violated the Constitution and his oath of office. He was removed from his presidential position on 6 April 2004. An amendment to the Presidential Elections Act barred him from running for office, which was later upheld by the Constitutional Court, emphasizing that those removed through impeachment could never again assume presidential office. Subsequent legislative amendments further disqualified him from parliamentary positions.

Nevertheless, the only remedies that must be exhausted are those that are effective and capable of redressing the alleged violation (see, among many other authorities, Remli v. France, 23 April 1996, § 33, Reports 1996‑II). More specifically, the only remedies which Article 35 § 1 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient; the existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, for example, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803\/94, § 75, ECHR 1999-V). It falls to the respondent State, if it pleads non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, to establish that these various conditions are satisfied (see, among other authorities, Johnston and Others v.

It follows from Article 107 of the Lithuanian Constitution that decisions of the Constitutional Court have statutory force and are final. Furthermore, as the Government pointed out in their written observations, the Constitutional Court itself is bound by its own precedents. An appeal against a refusal to register the applicant as a candidate for election to the Seimas would therefore have been bound to fail. Indeed, the Supreme Administrative Court's decision of 28 May 2004 provides an illustration of this point, since it attached decisive weight to the Constitutional Court's conclusions of 25 May 2004 in dismissing the applicant's complaint against the refusal of the Central Electoral Committee to register him as a candidate in the 2004 presidential election.\nThe Court also takes note of the Government's argument that the applicant could have made a prior request to the Constitutional Court for clarification of whether removal from office entailed lifelong disqualification from standing for election and that, if that position were confirmed, he could have resigned before the vote on whether to remove him from office. Such a request could not, however, have prompted an examination of the applicant's particular situation for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.

The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Vilnius. He is currently a member of the European Parliament.', '10.  On 5 January 2003 the applicant was elected President of the Republic of Lithuania. He took office on 26 February 2003, following his inauguration. On that occasion, in accordance with Article 82 of the Constitution, he took an oath to be loyal to the Republic of Lithuania and the Constitution, to fulfil the duties of his office conscientiously, and to be equally just to all.', \"11.  On 11 April 2003 the applicant issued Decree no. 40, countersigned by the Minister of the Interior, granting Lithuanian citizenship “by way of exception” (išimties tvarka) to a Russian businessman, J.B., who had been awarded the Medal of Darius and Girėnas in 2001 by the applicant's predecessor, Valdas Adamkus, for services to Lithuania (he was subsequently divested of the medal following the events outlined below).\", \"12.  On 6 November 2003 the Seimas (the Lithuanian Parliament) requested the Constitutional Court to determine whether Presidential Decree no. 40 was in compliance with the Constitution and the Citizenship Act. The Seimas submitted that the procedure of granting citizenship by way of exception appeared to have been applied inappropriately in this case. In particular, it asserted that J.B. had no special merit warranting his exceptional treatment and that the applicant had in fact granted him citizenship as a reward for his substantial assistance by financial and other means to the applicant's election campaign.\", '13.  On 10 November 2003 the Constitutional Court accepted the request for consideration as case no. 40\/03. On 10 December 2003 it held a public hearing and examined witnesses.', \"14.  On 12 December 2003 an article was published in a Lithuanian daily newspaper, Respublika, reporting that the President of the Constitutional Court had been seen in a coffee bar with the Deputy Speaker of the Seimas, who had been closely involved in the inquiry into the applicant's activities. The newspaper implied that during this informal meeting the two officials had discussed the proceedings taking place in the Constitutional Court, thus casting a shadow of suspicion over that court's objectivity. The two men had subsequently said that they often met professionally and socially, and denied discussing the merits of the case.\", \"15.  Referring to the above-mentioned newspaper article, the applicant's lawyers challenged the President of the Constitutional Court for bias, seeking his removal from the examination of case no. 40\/03. Their challenge was dismissed on the ground that the mere fact that the two officials had met informally did not constitute a basis for the withdrawal of a judge from proceedings before the Constitutional Court.\", '16.  On 30 December 2003 the Constitutional Court gave its ruling in case no. 40\/03, finding that Decree no. 40 was not in compliance with Article 29 § 1, Article 82 § 1 and Article 84 § 21 of the Constitution, the constitutional principle of the rule of law and section 16(1) of the Citizenship Act.', \"17.  On the last point, the Constitutional Court observed that citizenship could be granted by way of exception only to persons who had never been Lithuanian citizens. It noted in that connection that J.B., a Russian citizen by birth from a Soviet military family, had acquired Lithuanian citizenship under the Citizenship Act of 3 November 1989, by which citizenship could be granted, inter alia, to persons who on that date had had their permanent residence and permanent place of work or source of income in Lithuania. In 1994 the Constitutional Court had ruled that “soldiers of the Soviet Union who previously served in the Soviet occupying military forces unlawfully stationed in the territory of Lithuania [could] not be regarded as permanently residing and working in Lithuania”. On 4 November 1999 the Citizenship Commission (established in 1998 under section 4 of the 1995 Implementing Act for the Citizenship Act) had found that J.B.'s status was unlawful, since he had served in the Soviet armed forces. It had nevertheless recommended that his status be regularised in accordance with the above-mentioned section 4, by which exceptions could be made for persons who had acquired citizenship in good faith before 31 December 1993 on that unlawful ground. On 11 November 1999 the Migration Department of the Ministry of the Interior had followed that recommendation. However, in 2000 J.B. had applied for Russian citizenship, which he had been granted in June 2002; on 18 March 2003 he had been issued with a Russian passport, thereby losing his Lithuanian citizenship. The Constitutional Court observed that the applicant had signed Decree no. 40 on 11 April 2003 even though the Migration Department of the Ministry of the Interior had reminded him the day before that J.B. had previously lost his Lithuanian citizenship.\", '18.  The Constitutional Court held that, as a result, Decree no. 40 was also in breach of Article 84 § 21 of the Constitution – which provides that the President is to grant citizenship in accordance with the procedure established by law – and the constitutional principle of the rule of law.', \"19.  The Constitutional Court went on to note that, although the Lithuanian authorities had already made an exception in his favour by regularising his status in 1999, J.B. had acquired Russian citizenship in 2000. This showed that “citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania was of less value to [J.B.] than citizenship of the Russian Federation”. The Constitutional Court further noted that the Director of the State Security Department had informed the applicant, prior to 11 April 2003, that an investigation was being carried out into J.B.'s activities as director of an aviation company and, on 17 March 2003, that J.B. had threatened to disseminate information discrediting the applicant if the latter failed to keep his promise to appoint him as an adviser. In the Constitutional Court's view, the applicant had knowingly ignored these circumstances, although they were of crucial importance in deciding whether or not to grant citizenship to J.B. by way of exception. Having regard also to the fact that J.B. had made a significant financial contribution to the applicant's election campaign, it concluded that the decision to grant him citizenship had been “determined not by any merit rendering [J.B.] worthy of becoming a citizen of the Republic of Lithuania, but by his significant assistance by financial and other means to [the applicant's] election campaign in 2002”. Thus, “the granting of citizenship to [J.B.] by way of exception was nothing but a reward by the President of the Republic R. Paksas to [J.B.] for the aforesaid support”; consequently, in issuing Decree no. 40, the President had heeded “neither the Constitution ... nor the law, nor the interests of the people and the State, but purely his own interests”. The court therefore concluded that the applicant had “afforded [J.B.] exceptional treatment and knowingly disregarded the fundamental principles enshrined in Article 29 § 1 and Article 82 § 1 of the Constitution respectively, whereby all persons are equal before State institutions or officials, and the President of the Republic must be equally just to all”.\", \"20.  In a public speech on 31 December 2003, and again in his New Year speech, the applicant declared that “politics [had] taken precedence over the law” in the Constitutional Court's ruling. In reply, on 5 January 2004 the Constitutional Court issued a public statement emphasising its independence and noting, inter alia, that the applicant had attempted to undermine its authority.\", \"21.  On 18 December 2003, eighty-six members of the Seimas submitted a proposal to initiate impeachment proceedings against the applicant. On 23 December 2003 the Seimas set up a special commission to investigate the reasonableness and seriousness of certain allegations about the applicant's conduct, in order to determine whether such proceedings should indeed be initiated.\", \"22.  On 19 February 2004 the special investigation commission concluded that some of the charges levelled against the applicant were founded and serious. Accordingly, it recommended that the Seimas institute impeachment proceedings. The State Security Department had apparently provided the commission with transcripts of secretly taped telephone conversations involving the applicant. The applicant's lawyers were not given access to the transcripts by the Department or by the commission, because it had decided not to rely on them.\", \"23.  Also on 19 February 2004 the Seimas decided to follow the special investigation commission's recommendation and requested the Constitutional Court to determine whether the specific acts of the applicant cited by the commission had breached the Constitution. The impeachment charges submitted to the Constitutional Court included the following allegations in particular, involving purely private interests to the detriment of those of the nation, thus discrediting the institution of the presidency:\\n– that the applicant had undertaken to perform a number of actions in J.B.'s favour in exchange for financial and other forms of support during his election campaign, and had later acted under J.B.'s influence;\\n– that, as a reward for this support, the applicant had unlawfully granted Lithuanian citizenship to J.B.;\\n– that he had disclosed a State secret by informing J.B. that the secret services were investigating his activities, notably by telephone tapping; and\\n– that he had exercised undue pressure on the management decisions of a private company in order to secure pecuniary advantages for certain people close to him.\", '24.  On 1 March 2004 the Constitutional Court accepted the request for consideration as case no. 14\/04.', \"25.  The applicant's lawyers sought the removal of the President of the Constitutional Court and all its members on grounds of bias, arguing that they had in effect already determined the case in the previous ruling of 30 December 2003 in case no. 40\/03. The challenge was dismissed.\", '26.  In a declaration of 25 March 2004 the Seimas unsuccessfully proposed that the applicant tender his resignation in order to avoid protracted impeachment proceedings. The declaration alleged that his actions had become increasingly unpredictable and represented a danger to the State, its citizens and the prestige of the presidency.', \"27.  On 31 March 2004 the Constitutional Court concluded that the applicant had committed gross violations of the Constitution and a breach of his constitutional oath on account of the following acts:\\n– unlawfully granting citizenship to J.B. by Decree no. 40 as a reward for the latter's financial and other forms of support, in breach of section 16(1) of the Citizenship Act and Article 29 § 1, Article 82 § 1 and Article 84 § 21 of the Constitution;\\n– knowingly hinting to J.B., in breach of sections 3(7), 9(2) and 14(1) of the Official Secrets Act and Article 77 § 2 and Article 82 § 1 of the Constitution, that the law-enforcement institutions were investigating him and tapping his telephone conversations; and\\n– exploiting his official status to influence decisions by the Žemaitijos keliai company concerning the transfer of shares with a view to defending the property interests of certain private individuals close to him, in breach of section 3 of the Adjustment of Private and Public Interests in the Public Service Act and Article 29 § 1, Article 77 § 2 and Article 82 § 1 of the Constitution.\", '28.  The applicant sought clarification of these conclusions under section 61 of the Constitutional Court Act, but his request was refused by the Constitutional Court on 6 April 2004 on procedural grounds.', '29.  On 6 April 2004 the Seimas decided to remove the applicant from the office of President on account of the gross violations of the Constitution found by the Constitutional Court. Its decision was taken by eighty-six votes to seventeen for the first breach, eighty-six votes to eighteen for the second and eighty-nine votes to fourteen for the third.', '30.  The applicant wished to stand as a candidate in the presidential election called for 13 June 2004. On 22 April 2004 the Central Electoral Committee (CEC) found that there was nothing to prevent him from standing. By 7 May 2004 the applicant had gathered the required number of signatures in support of his candidacy, and submitted them to the CEC with a view to his registration as a candidate.', '31.  However, on 4 May 2004 the Seimas amended the Presidential Elections Act by inserting the following provision:\\n“A person who has been removed from parliamentary or other office by the Seimas in impeachment proceedings may not be elected President of the Republic if less than five years have elapsed since his removal from office.”', '32.  Following this amendment, the CEC refused to register the applicant as a candidate in the forthcoming election. The applicant lodged a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court on 10 May 2004, arguing in particular that that decision thwarted the legitimate expectations of his supporters and ran counter to the principles of the rule of law and the prohibition of retrospective legislation.', '33.  On an unspecified date, a number of members of the Seimas requested the Constitutional Court to review the constitutionality of the amendment to the Presidential Elections Act, arguing that barring a person who had been removed from office from running for election as President was in itself in breach of the Constitution. The request was registered as case no. 24\/04.', '34.  The Constitutional Court held on 25 May 2004 that disqualifying a person who had been removed from office from standing in presidential elections was compatible with the Constitution, but that subjecting such a restriction to a time-limit was unconstitutional. The court held, inter alia:\\n“... The Constitutional Court has held that a breach of the oath is, at the same time, a gross violation of the Constitution, while a gross violation of the Constitution is, at the same time, a breach of the oath to the nation (Constitutional Court ruling of 30 December 2003; Constitutional Court conclusion of 31 March 2004) ...\\nA gross violation of the Constitution or a breach of the oath undermines trust in the institution of the presidency and in State authority as a whole ... Removal from office of a president who has grossly violated the Constitution or breached the oath is one of the ways of protecting the State for the common good of society, as provided for in the Constitution.\\nIt needs to be stressed that, under the Constitution, a person in respect of whom the Seimas – following a finding by the Constitutional Court that he, as President, has committed a gross violation of the Constitution and breached the oath – has applied the constitutional sanction, namely removal from office, may not evade constitutional liability through fresh presidential elections, a referendum or any other means...\\nThe Constitution does not provide that, after a certain time has elapsed, a president whose actions have been recognised by the Constitutional Court as having grossly violated the Constitution, and who has been found to have breached the oath and has been removed from office by the Seimas [on that account] ..., may [subsequently] be treated as though he had not breached the oath or committed a gross violation of the Constitution ... [A person] ... who has been removed from office by the Seimas, the body representing the people, will always remain someone who has breached his oath to the nation and grossly violated the Constitution, and who has been dismissed as President for those reasons ...\\n[A person removed from the office of President] may never again ... give an oath to the nation, as there would always exist a reasonable doubt ... as to its reliability...\\nImpeachment is a form of public and democratic scrutiny of those holding public office, a measure of self-protection for the community, a ... defence against high-ranking officials who disregard the Constitution and laws...\\nWhere a person has been removed from the office of President ... for a gross violation of the Constitution or a breach of the oath ... he may never again be elected President of the Republic [or] a member of the Seimas; [he] may never hold office as ... a member of the Government, [or] the National Audit Officer, that is, [he] may not hold an office provided for in the Constitution for which it is necessary to take an oath in accordance with the Constitution ...”', \"35.  On 28 May 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's complaint against the decision of the CEC, referring, inter alia, to the Constitutional Court's ruling of 25 May 2004. It noted in particular:\\n“... It appears from the reasoning of the Constitutional Court that ... the applicant has forfeited the right to be elected President with effect from 6 April 2004. Therefore, he ... cannot take part in the election announced on 15 April 2004...\\nUntil it was amended on 4 May 2004, the Presidential Elections Act did not specify the [residual] rights of a person who had forfeited the right to be elected President.\\nArticle 6 § 1 of the Constitution provides that the Constitution is directly applicable ... [I]t follows that, from the moment ... the applicant submitted his candidacy for the election, his situation was governed by the Constitution, which, as the Constitutional Court has found, bars [a person removed from the office of President] from standing in presidential elections. In these circumstances ... there has been no breach of the principle of the prohibition of retrospective legislation...”\", '36.  On 15 July 2004 the Seimas passed an amendment to the Seimas Elections Act, to the effect that any official who had been removed from office following impeachment proceedings was disqualified from being a member of parliament.', '37.  In autumn 2004 the Prosecutor General discontinued the investigation into allegations that while in office, the applicant had abused his authority in relation to a private company (Article 228 of the Criminal Code).', \"38.  On an unspecified date the applicant was charged with disclosing information classified as a State secret (Article 125 § 1 of the Criminal Code). On 25 October 2004 the Vilnius Regional Court acquitted him for lack of evidence. On 1 March 2005 the Court of Appeal reversed that decision, finding the applicant guilty. It held, however, that owing to new circumstances, namely the applicant's removal from office as President and disqualification from elected office, it was reasonable to discharge him from criminal liability and to discontinue the criminal proceedings. On 13 December 2005 the Supreme Court quashed the Court of Appeal's judgment, upholding the acquittal delivered by the Vilnius Regional Court.\", '39.  On account of his threat to disseminate information discrediting the applicant if he failed to keep his promise to appoint him as an adviser (see paragraph 19 above), J.B. was convicted of having, for his own benefit and “by means of mental coercion, required a civil servant or person in a position of public authority to carry out or refrain from certain actions” (Article 287 § 1 of the Criminal Code). He was fined 10,000 Lithuanian litai, equivalent to approximately 2,900 euros (judgments of the Vilnius City 1st District Court of 22 November 2004, the Vilnius Regional Court of 6 April 2005, and the Supreme Court of 18 October 2005).']","facts":"The applicant, born in 1956, became the President of Lithuania on 26 February 2003. Shortly after taking office, he controversially granted Lithuanian citizenship to a Russian businessman, J.B., which was later challenged for breaching the Constitution. The Constitutional Court found that the decree violated the Constitution as J.B. had no exceptional merits justifying such a grant and had financially supported the applicant’s election campaign. Furthermore, the Court noted that the applicant acted under J.B.'s influence, disclosed state secrets, and exercised inappropriate influence over a private company. The Seimas initiated impeachment proceedings, and the Constitutional Court confirmed the applicant had grossly violated the Constitution and his oath of office. He was removed from his presidential position on 6 April 2004. An amendment to the Presidential Elections Act barred him from running for office, which was later upheld by the Constitutional Court, emphasizing that those removed through impeachment could never again assume presidential office. Subsequent legislative amendments further disqualified him from parliamentary positions. Although investigations into some allegations were dropped, he was acquitted of disclosing state secrets due to lack of evidence. J.B. was fined for attempting to coerce the applicant.","a":"The Court notes that the applicant raised this issue before the Appeal Court, which examined it, even though it did not refer to it in its judgment. Considering that the applicant has not further substantiated his claim, the Court finds no indication of any violation in this respect. It follows that this complaint must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.","b":"The Court notes that the applicant did not raise the issue of Article 14 in any of the domestic proceedings, and has failed otherwise to challenge the different policies before the domestic courts. There is thus a real question as to whether the applicant has exhausted domestic remedies, as required by Article 35 of the Convention.","c":"Under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, the Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted.","d":"It follows from the foregoing that the Government have not shown that a domestic remedy satisfying the requirements of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention was available to the applicant.","label":"D","difficulty_signal_facts_len":0.4390243902,"difficulty_signal_context_len":0.5436308927,"difficulty_signal_option_similarity":0.1728200221,"difficulty_signal_overlap_ambiguity":0.9885196157,"difficulty_signal_negation_density":0.6011391175,"toughness_score":0.5409210713}

The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Cartigny, Switzerland.', '10.  The applicant and his wife, B., who was of Finnish origin, had two children, a boy T. born on 2 June 1987 and a girl A. born on 28 September 1989. The family lived together in Switzerland until 1993 when B. took the children to Finland where she took up residence with L. as her female partner.', '11.  On 10 June 1994, B. applied for divorce and for custody of the children.', '12.  On 10 October 1994 the parents reached an interim agreement whereby the children would stay in Finland with their mother for the moment and the applicant have the right to three supervised visits.', '13.  The applicant states that on 13 October 1994 he became aware that the children’s maternal grandmother had made a complaint to the social services against B.’s female partner, L., alleging that she had sexually abused A. There is some indication in the documents that the applicant may also have lodged a complaint on this ground. The criminal charges lodged against L. were later dismissed by the courts.', '14.  Meanwhile, it appears that the applicant took proceedings with a view to having the children returned to Switzerland under the Hague Convention. However, by decisions of the Court of Appeal dated 7 December 1994 and by the Supreme Court dated 15 June 1995, the applicant’s application for return was refused, principally on the ground that he had voluntarily entered into an interim agreement that the children remain in Finland with their mother.', '15.  On 20 August 1996, the District Court awarded sole custody of the children to the mother, finding that the children had lived with their mother in Finland since 1993 and that it was in their best interests to remain with her. On 8 July 1997, the Court of Appeal upheld this decision, as did the Supreme Court on 14 November 1997.', '16.  The applicant was however granted visiting rights. It appears that the children visited him in Switzerland during Easter and the summer of 1997 and met with him in Finland in 1998 (twice) and 1999 (three times).', '17.  On 30 August 1999, B., the mother, died. The children were then aged twelve and nine years respectively.', '18.  The applicant returned immediately to Finland. On 23 September 1999, he lodged a request that the children, still living with L., be placed in a foster home and that he be accorded visiting rights.', '19.  Applications for custody of the children were lodged by both L. and by the applicant. During October 1999, the children were interviewed twice by a team consisting of a child psychiatrist and two psychologists. They expressed their wish to stay with L. because they felt safe and were used to living with her. A. was reported as stating that she would like to meet the applicant occasionally but only when she wished, while T. was reported as stating that the applicant was not part of his family and that he neither wanted to meet him or live in Switzerland.', '20.  The applicant saw the children three times during September 1999 in supervised contact visits. There was another meeting outside the social workers’ premises.', '21.  In a Social Welfare Board report dated 26 October 1999, it was stated that, following the mother’s death, L.’s influence on the children had increased and the children turned to her for support. It was noted that the children were not able to act against L.’s will, because they were dependent on her at that time. Consequently, the children were in a state of conflict, as they were not allowed to like the applicant. The report considered that the lack of contact with their close relatives endangered the development of their identity.', '22.  On 21 December 1999, after oral hearings at which the applicant, L. and another 18 witnesses, including a number of social workers involved in the case, were heard, the District Court awarded custody to the applicant. It observed inter alia, that according to the evidence, L. had been involved in bringing up the children since their return to Finland. According to a number of social workers involved in the case, the applicant was considered fit to be a custodial parent as, for example, in dealing with conflicts he had always put the children’s best interests first. The meetings between the children had also gone well. It concluded that in fact both L. and the applicant were fit as custodians.', '23.  As regarded the views of the children, the District Court recalled that according to a statement of 23 February 1998 given by a social worker during previous proceedings, T.’s wishes were not entirely his own; he had been influenced by B., his mother. His wishes were in contradiction with what he had told the social worker about the meetings with the applicant which had taken place. The social worker had noted that the fact that B. did not want T. to travel to see the applicant was significant and pointed out that it would be very important for the children’s psychological development that they develop a more constructive view of the applicant. It recalled the evidence of a friend of B. and L., who had given evidence before the court, had stated that the children’s attitude towards the applicant had begun to be more positive from the summer of 1998, but that no meetings had taken place as from March 1999, apparently due to the fact that the children’s activities were given priority and the meetings with the applicant tended to be proposed at short notice. T. had told her that it would be alright to meet with the applicant if he could decide when. A. had told her that she would like to meet with the applicant some day, but not at that time. T.’s attitude towards meeting the applicant was therefore fairly positive. Following B.’s death, everything had changed when the applicant came to see his children. As he allegedly had said that the law would make the children move to live in Switzerland, they did not want to meet with him anymore. According to this witness, the children feared moving to Switzerland.', '24.  The District Court considered that T.’s attitude during the recent interviews was in contradiction with what had happened during the meetings with the applicant, which had all gone well. It found that none of the persons heard before the court had said that the children feared the applicant and concluded that, as the atmosphere in which the children had been living had obviously affected their wishes and hopes, it was not possible to analyse what their true views really were. Therefore, their expressed wishes could not be decisive when deciding the case. Noting that the case should be decided in accordance with the children’s best interests, it decided that, given the strained relations between L. and the applicant, custody should be awarded to the latter. It was evident that L. would not be able to encourage the relationship between the children and the applicant enabling them to stay in contact. Therefore, the District Court ordered that custody be awarded to the applicant.', '25.  Pending L.’s appeal against the decision, the enforcement of the order was suspended by the Court of Appeal on 22 December 1999. According to the evidence of various social workers, the children had reacted to his expressed intention of taking them to Switzerland by refusing to meet with him unless L. was present. The applicant allegedly refused to meet with the children under these terms. The applicant’s attempts to enforce contact visits also apparently failed due to the children’s refusal to see him.', '26.  On 3 April 2000, the Court of Appeal overturned the decision concerning the suspension and requested the Social Welfare Board and its Swiss counterpart to report on the case. During the period June-September 2000, pursuant to the court’s request, the children were interviewed five times by social workers, three times in the presence of L. and twice alone. The social workers’ efforts to arrange a meeting between the children and the applicant were unsuccessful due to the children’s opposition. It was reported by the social worker in later oral evidence that the children continued to express their wish to live with L. During the interviews, the children had turned to L. for support and been dependent on her. The children’s memories of the applicant were, however, good. Nothing suggested that the children would have had any reason to feel unsafe in the applicant’s company. According to one of the social workers at the meetings, the wishes that the children expressed were more dependent on the wishes of L. than their own will. According to the evidence given by other witnesses in the Court of Appeal, including other social workers, the children expressed their wish to be left alone and that they wanted to stay in Finland every time the applicant was brought up for discussion. They seemed to fear moving to Switzerland.', '27.  Meanwhile, it appears that the applicant applied to the District Court for its original order to be enforced. This request was refused on 31 August 2000. His appeal to the Court of Appeal was later rejected on 28 June 2001 as meanwhile it had reached a fresh decision in the case. An application by the applicant to have the children placed in a foster home away from L. was also dismissed by the Social Welfare Board on 5 April 2000 and his appeal rejected by the Administrative Court of Helsinki on 19 December 2000.', '28.  On 23 March 2001, after an oral hearing over four days during February and at which the applicant and L. were heard as well as eleven other witnesses from the District Court proceedings and four new witnesses, the Court of Appeal upheld the District Court’s judgment. It ordered that the children move to live with the applicant on 16 August 2001, after a transitional period during which the children could meet with the applicant one weekend per month and one week during the summer.', '29.  In its judgment, the Court of Appeal agreed that both L. and the applicant were fit to have custody: nothing suggested that they would not be fit. Given the ages of the children, it considered that their view had to be taken into account, but it was also evident that the strained relationship and litigation between the applicant and B., and later on L., had had influence on their view. It considered that the negative attitude towards meeting with the applicant was based on the fear of having to move to Switzerland. Nothing suggested that the children feared the applicant as such. Although the children were as mature as other children their age, they could not however be given the absolute right to decide on their future, particularly in light of their extremely difficult situation at that time. Notwithstanding the law on enforcement, the court did not consider that in deciding on custody it was bound to follow the opinion even of a child aged 12 or more. Concluding that the decision should be based on what was in their best interests, it found that the relationship between the children and the applicant was very important for a well-balanced development. It furthermore found that the fact that the applicant had said that he would allow the children to keep in touch with L. was in the best interests of the children. While it was true that the children appeared closer to L. and their environment (including their home, school, hobbies and close personal relations) would stay the same if custody was awarded to L., the Court of Appeal concluded, nonetheless, that the children’s views did not correspond to their best interests. A situation which would lead the children and the applicant drift further apart was not in their best interests. Accordingly, it ordered that the applicant be awarded custody from 16 August 2001 after a transitional period of increased contact with the children.', '30.  The applicant visited Finland in March, April and May 2001, requesting visits with his children. On 30 March 2001, the applicant arrived in Helsinki and requested to see the children the same day. The social worker contacted L. to inform her of this and reported that the children refused. They allegedly wanted L. or another person to be present whereas the applicant refused any third party involvement. On only one occasion, in May 2001, did a visit take place when it was agreed between the parties that the children see the applicant at their maternal grandmother’s. However, only T. appeared, accompanied by a friend and one of L.’s lawyers. On this occasion, an incident occurred, the accounts of which vary but to which the police were called. T. subsequently informed his social worker that he was afraid of his father, who had tried, T. alleged, to keep him in the grandmother’s apartment by force and stated that he did not wish to see him again. The children did not appear at the next meeting in May 2001. They had already informed him that it would serve no purpose for him to come to Helsinki as they did not wish to see him. The social workers had several meetings with the children during this period and also made contact with their school seeking to persuade the children to attend therapy sessions. The children were recorded as stating that the applicant only made critical comments and demands and held strong views that they did not wish to live their friends and the environment they knew and that they did not trust their father. T. stated that he feared that his father would attempt to force them to leave Finland.', '31.  L. applied for leave to appeal. On 20 June 2001, the Supreme Court granted L. leave to appeal and suspended the enforcement of the Court of Appeal’s order. L. applied for an oral hearing, requesting that the parties, and possibly also the children, be heard. In his submissions to the Supreme Court in reply, the applicant applied for interim visiting rights and for the current psychological state of the children to be examined. He also requested that if L.’s request for an oral hearing was granted the Supreme Court should rehear the evidence presented before the lower courts.', '32.  On 19 October 2001, the Supreme Court gave judgment on the outstanding issues (Supreme Court Reports 2001:110). It re-iterated that it had rejected the request for an interim order as being purposeless and the request for a psychological examination as being unnecessary. It also rejected the request for an oral hearing as unnecessary in the circumstances and for the reasons set out in its judgment.', '33.  The Supreme Court recalled that, according to the Custody Act, the issue of custody had to be decided with regard to the child’s best interests and that if the custodial parent of the children died, custody could be given either to the other parent or to another person, depending on where the best interests of the child lay. It agreed with both the lower courts that the applicant and L. were both fit to act as custodians. Both children however had said that they wanted to stay in the environment which they knew and with L. Their views had been thoroughly examined before both the District Court and the Court of Appeal and although the conflict between the adults had apparently disturbed the relationship between the children and the applicant, there was nothing to suggest that their wish to remain with L. was not their own independent opinion, in particular given their age and maturity.', '34.  The Supreme Court referred to section 2 of the Act on the Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody and Access Rights and recalling that T. was 14 and A. was 12, found that a custody decision which required the children to move would not be possible to enforce. Having regard to the purpose of awarding custody, it would not be in the children’s best interests to issue a custody order to a parent to whom they could not be transferred against their will. As the relations between the applicant and L. were bad, there was no reason to consider that it would be possible for the applicant to have custody while they continued to live with L. as that would render it impossible to take practical decisions concerning the children’s lives. In the circumstances of this case, it was therefore not in the best interests of the children to transfer custody to the applicant against their will but custody should be awarded instead to the person with whom they were currently living.', '35.  The Supreme Court went on to remark that future contact visits could be carried out under agreement or court order but that given the age of the children it would be dependent on their willingness to see the applicant. It underlined that according to the Custody Act, the custodian of children was under an obligation to co-operate in order to promote and maintain relationships between children and a parent. It did not make any order on the point. The applicant had not made any application in that regard.', '36.  The Supreme Court therefore overturned the decisions of the lower courts and awarded custody to L.', '37.  On 16 April 2002, the Administrative Court of Helsinki dismissed the applicant’s renewed request for the children to be placed in a foster home.']","facts":"The applicant, born in 1955 and residing in Switzerland, was involved in a lengthy custody dispute over his two children following their mother's move to Finland in 1993 with her new partner, L. After the mother's death in 1999, custody applications were lodged by both the applicant and L. Despite initial custody being awarded to the applicant by the District Court in 1999, the children expressed a strong wish to remain with L., citing a fear of moving to Switzerland. This preference was influenced by the strained relationship and litigation between the applicant and L. Upon appeal, the Finnish Court of Appeal maintained the decision that custody should be with the applicant but ensured a transitional visitation period. However, the Supreme Court eventually overturned this decision in 2001, granting custody to L. and emphasizing the children's mature unwillingness to move and the impracticality of enforcing such a transfer against their will. The applicant's requests for interim visits and psychological assessments of the children were deemed unnecessary, and the court highlighted the obligation of promoting a relationship between the children and their father under L.'s custody. Subsequent appeals by the applicant regarding foster home placement were dismissed, reaffirming custody with L. due to the best interests of the children.","a":"The Court notes that the lack of an oral hearing was an essential, and integral, part of its finding of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraph 58 above). In the circumstances of the present case no separate issue arises under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.","b":"Accordingly, the Court does not consider it necessary to ascertain whether the other requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 8 were complied with. Consequently the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.","c":"The Court observes, however, that it has examined essentially the same issues under Article 7 of the Convention. In the light of its finding of a violation of Article 7, it concludes that in the circumstances of the present case it is unnecessary to examine the applicant’s complaints under Articles 6, 13 and 17 of the Convention.","d":"Bearing in mind its finding of a violation of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine whether the facts alleged also constituted deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5.","label":"A","difficulty_signal_facts_len":0.5487804878,"difficulty_signal_context_len":0.3580742227,"difficulty_signal_option_similarity":0.2938918733,"difficulty_signal_overlap_ambiguity":0.9833632422,"difficulty_signal_negation_density":0.4820372809,"toughness_score":0.5365665817}

Initially, a 2000 article in the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper had disclosed details about O.T.'s personal life during a presidential election campaign, which resulted in the conviction of the original article's journalist and editor-in-chief for privacy infringement. Subsequently, in February 2002, Helsingin Sanomat published articles about the court proceedings and the Forssa District Court's judgment, including previously mentioned personal details about O.T. Following complaints by O.T., the prosecutor charged the applicants, leading to a Vantaa District Court verdict on 3 November 2005, which found them guilty of disseminating private information. Appeals by the applicants, claiming an infringement of their free expression rights under Article 10 of the Convention, were unsuccessful at both the Helsinki Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, which refused leave to appeal in December 2007.\nArguments: The Court has already noted that a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual to regulate his conduct: he must be able - if need be with appropriate advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may entail excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are a question of practice (see Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 49, Series A no. 30 and mutatis mutandis Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 40, Series A no. 260-A).\nAs concerns the provision in question at the relevant time, Chapter 24, section 8, of the Penal Code, the Court has already found in the Eerikäinen case (see Eerikäinen and Others v. Finland, no. 3514\/02, § 58, 10 February 2009), in which the earlier provision of the Penal Code was at stake, namely that of Chapter 27, section 3(a), that it did not discern any ambiguity as to its contents: the spreading of information, an insinuation or an image depicting the private life of another person which was conducive to causing suffering qualified as invasion of privacy. Furthermore, the Court notes that the exception in the second sentence of the earlier provision concerning persons in a public office or function, in professional life, in a political activity or in another comparable activity is equally clearly worded (see Flinkkilä and Others v. Finland, no. 25576\/04, § 66, 6 April 2010). The Court finds that the content of Chapter 24, section 8, of the Penal Code corresponds to the old Chapter 27, section 3(a), of the Penal Code as the amendments and clarifications made to the existing provision have been mainly technical (see and compare Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279\/02 and 36448\/02, § 42, ECHR 2007‑XI).\nWhile at the time when the articles in question were published, in February 2002, there were five Supreme Court decisions concerning the interpretation of the provisions in question, all of which concerned different aspects of private life, the Court finds that the possibility that a sanction would be imposed for invasion of private life was not unforeseeable. Even though there was no precise definition of private life in the preparatory works (see government bills HE 84\/1974 and HE 184\/1999), these works mentioned that the necessity of mentioning a person's name or other description of a person enabling identification was always subject to careful consideration. Had the applicants had doubts about the exact scope of the provision in question they should have either sought advice about its content or refrained from disclosing O.T.'s identity. Moreover, the applicants, who were professional journalists, could not claim to be ignorant of the content of the said provision since the Guidelines for Journalists and the practice of the Council for Mass Media, although not binding, provided even more strict rules than the Penal Code provision in question.\nContinuation options:\nA: This interference would contravene Article 10 of the Convention unless it was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10, and was “necessary in a democratic society” for achieving such aim or aims. The Court will examine each of these criteria in turn.\nB: The Court considers that, having regard to the circumstances of the present case, her complaint falls to be examined under Article 8 of the Convention (see X v. Finland, no. 34806\/04, § 230, ECHR 2012 (extracts)), the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life ...\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”\nC: The Court concludes therefore that the interference was “prescribed by law” (see Nikula v. Finland, no. 31611\/96, § 34, ECHR 2002-II; Selistö v. Finland, no. 56767\/00, § 34, 16 November 2004; Karhuvaara and Iltalehti v. Finland, no. 53678\/00, § 43, ECHR 2004-X; Eerikäinen and Others v.

In addition, it has not been disputed that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2.\n3.

The first and second applicants were born in 1963 and 1948 and live in Helsinki. The applicant company is based in Helsinki. The applicant company is the publisher of a daily newspaper called Helsingin Sanomat which has a circulation of approximately 430,000. The first applicant was a journalist and the second applicant the editor-in-chief of the publication at the relevant time.', '6.  On 3 February 2000, during the presidential election campaign, a short article was published in the newspaper Ilta-Sanomat, entitled “The ex-husband of [R. U.] and the person in charge of communications for the [E.A.] campaign have found each other”. The article stated that P.N., who was separated from his wife, had found a new partner, O.T. The wife of P.N. was known as a political reporter in the election-related TV debates and previously as a news reader. It was mentioned in the article that O.T. was in charge of communications for the E. A. campaign and that, in her civilian life, O.T. was the communications manager in a specified pension insurance company and a mother.', \"7.  The article went on to state that, before joining the campaign, O.T. had been active in the same political party as P.N. and that she had been involved in some “insider committees”. The article continued to note that P.N. worked as a director for F., a company promoting Finnish exports, and that in the 1990s he had been posted in New York, where his wife had followed him, taking leave from her own job. The article stated that P.N. and his wife had two children and that they had separated in the autumn of 1999. Pictures of O.T. and P.N.'s wife were included in the article.\", \"8.  On 1 February 2002 the journalist and the editor-in-chief of Ilta-Sanomat were convicted by the Forssa District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) for having violated O.T.'s private life by publishing the original article. On 12 December 2002 and 4 July 2005, respectively, the Turku Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten) and the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen) upheld the judgment. These proceedings were public.\", '9.  On 2 and 10 February 2002 the applicant company published two articles on the trial and the judgment of the Forssa District Court, written by the first applicant and approved by the second applicant.', \"10.  The first article summarised the judgment of the District Court, including O.T.'s full name and the court's sentence. It also described the court proceedings and stated that the decision had required a vote as one of the lay members of the court would have preferred to dismiss the charges. Moreover, the first article also included some of the details about O.T.'s private life already published in the original article of 3 February 2000.\", '11.  The second article was published as a legal column in a Sunday edition of the paper. The article reproduced the content of the original article without mentioning any names. It made reference to the trial and went on to explain the history of the Penal Code section concerning invasion of privacy that had been introduced in 1974. The article went on to state that the law did not define privacy, but left it to the courts to interpret on a case-by-case basis. The section was amended in 2000, but the only change in essence, according to the article, was the title of the section, now known as dissemination of information violating private life. The article further noted that the worst fears of the press had never materialised but there had been some surprises. The article made reference to a decision of the Supreme Court from 2001 to convict Alibi magazine for publishing a story with a picture and the name of a person who was at the time accused and later convicted of fraud on public pension funds. The article then reverted to the judgment in question pondering, without mentioning any names, as to who could be considered a private person and what was the responsibility of such a person with regard to his or her public performance and behaviour.', '12.  On 14 March 2002 O.T. requested that a criminal investigation be initiated against the applicants on the basis of the articles. The prosecutor pressed charges on 31 January 2003 and the applicants were summonsed on 31 March and 1 April 2003.', \"13.  As the original decision of 1 February 2002 by the Forssa District Court had been upheld by the Turku Court of Appeal on 12 December 2002 and was pending before the Supreme Court, the Vantaa District Court decided on 15 September 2004 to wait for the final decision in the original case before examining the applicants' case. It is stated in the decision of the Vantaa District Court that the request for adjournment was made by the applicants. This is contested by the first applicant.\", \"14.  On 4 July 2005 the Supreme Court gave a lengthy judgment in the case against Ilta-Sanomat (KKO 2005:82) wherein the question of whether the article had infringed O.T.'s privacy was thoroughly examined in the light of the national legislation and the case-law of the Court.\", \"15.  On 18 October 2005 the Vantaa District Court held a hearing in the applicants' case.\", '16.  On 3 November 2005 the District Court convicted the applicants of dissemination of information violating private life. The first applicant was ordered to pay 740 euros (EUR), the second applicant EUR 1,140, both amounts being 10 day fines as adjusted by their taxable income. All three applicants were ordered jointly to pay compensation to O.T. in the amount of EUR 6,000 plus interest for suffering and distress and EUR 11,845.95 plus interest for her legal costs.', '17.  The court found that as two years had passed since the publication of the original article, O.T. was now entitled to the total enjoyment of private life and that there had thus been no ground for the disclosure of her name. As to the legality principle, a Penal Code could not be drafted in a manner covering all possible situations that might be envisaged. The first applicant had been well aware of the legal situation, and the interpretation of the provision in question had been well established and foreseeable. When a court found that private life has been invaded, another offence will be committed if that judgment is reported by mentioning the very same details of private life. The court was not unanimous as one of the lay judges dissented.', '18.  By letters dated 30 November and 1 December 2005 the applicants appealed to the Helsinki Court of Appeal claiming, inter alia, that the conviction and sanctions imposed on them violated Article 10 of the Convention and that no grounds had been presented to show why it had been necessary in the present case to restrict their freedom of expression. Confidential information could only be disclosed once. The District Court judgment was public and everyone had a constitutional right to have information about a public document. The information had also been published twice before. The applicants had lacked intent as they had not realised that they were committing a crime when publishing the articles.', \"19.  On 20 April 2007 the Court of Appeal upheld the Vantaa District Court's judgment. The applicants were obliged to cover O.T.'s legal fees before the Court of Appeal in the amount of EUR 2,623 plus interest. The court found that the present case was about conflicting fundamental rights, namely the core areas of protection of private life and the margins of the freedom of expression. It was not juridically relevant whether the disclosed information was based on court case files or whether somebody else had earlier disclosed that information. As the Forssa District Court had on 1 February 2002 already found that the information disclosed in the original article had invaded O.T.'s privacy and as she was no longer in the same position as in 2000, the applicants had had no right to disclose her name when reporting on the Forssa District Court judgment.\", '20.  By letters dated 24 May and 13 June 2007 the applicants appealed to the Supreme Court, reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the Court of Appeal.', '21.  On 28 December 2007 the Supreme Court refused the applicants leave to appeal.']","facts":"The case involves two applicants, a journalist and an editor-in-chief from the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper, and their publishing company, who were convicted for violating the privacy of a woman, O.T., by disseminating personal information in articles concerning a 2002 court judgment.

The family sought asylum in Bulgaria in 2001 and was granted refugee status. The first applicant, the father, was later ordered to be expelled from Bulgaria on national security grounds in 2006 without detailed evidence provided at the time. This decision was based on allegations of involvement in drug trafficking, connections with extremist organizations, and other crimes. Despite attempts to contest the expulsion legally, including appeals to the Supreme Administrative Court, the order was upheld, citing national security. Subsequent requests for judicial review of his detention were mostly unsuccessful as the decisions were viewed as non-reviewable administrative actions. Eventually, attempts to deport him were halted due to inability to receive a travel document from the Lebanese Embassy and the applicant's inability to suggest a third country for removal.

There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well‑being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”\nThe Government submitted that the measures taken against the first applicant pursued a legitimate aim and were necessary. The Contracting States were entitled to expel an alien regardless of his or her level of integration. The first applicant’s removal from Bulgaria would not impose a disproportionate burden on the applicants, because they would be able to continue their family life outside the country. The circumstances in which the first applicant’s expulsion had been ordered showed that the authorities had not failed to strike a balance between the applicants’ rights and the public interest; they had carried out their duty to protect public order and national security. The expulsion order had not yet been put into effect, and the applicants’ family life could not therefore be regarded as already affected by it. The first applicant’s detention pending removal had not been disproportionate either, because the other applicants had been able to visit him in custody.\nThe applicants did not comment on the effects of the enforcement of the order for the first applicant’s expulsion on their family life. They submitted that the first applicant’s detention, which had lasted in total more than twenty‑two months, had been in breach of their right to respect for their family life, because it had been unlawful, in particular because of the first applicant’s refugee status; too lengthy; unnecessary; and not subject to judicial review. The first applicant had at all times remained at the authorities’ disposal and had not tried to flee. He could have been simply required to report to the police on a daily basis instead of being detained.

The first applicant was born in 1970 in Lebanon. The second applicant, his wife, was born in 1971 in Kuwait. The third and the fourth applicants, who are children of the first and second applicants, were born in 1991 and 1993 respectively in Lebanon. The fifth applicant, who is also a child of the first and second applicants, was born in 2002 in Bulgaria. All of the applicants currently live in Sofia, Bulgaria.', '8.  All of the applicants, except for the fifth one, who acquired Bulgarian nationality by virtue of being born on Bulgarian soil, are stateless.', '9.  On an unspecified date the first, second, third and fourth applicants came to Bulgaria. On 11 September 2001 the first applicant requested asylum. On 20 September 2001 the second, third and fourth applicants also requested asylum. In two decisions of 6 November 2001 the State Refugees Agency granted refugee status to all of them. The applicants did not provide any information about the reasons underlying the Agency’s decisions.', '10.  In 2002 the first and second applicants set up a limited liability company.', '11.  On 10 February 2006 the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs’ National Security Service made an order for the first applicant’s expulsion on the ground that he represented a serious threat to national security. He also barred him from residing in Bulgaria and entering its territory for a period of ten years. The order relied on section 42 of the Aliens Act 1998 (see paragraph 36 below). No factual grounds were given. The order went on to say that the first applicant was to be detained until it could be enforced, in line with section 44(6) of the same Act (see paragraph 46 below). Lastly, it stated that it was subject to appeal before the Minister of Internal Affairs, but not subject to judicial review, as provided by section 46(2)(3) of the Act, and that it was immediately enforceable, in accordance with section 44(4)(3) of the Act (see paragraphs 37 and 39 below).', '12.  The order was based on a classified proposal of 27 January 2006. The proposal, an excerpt of which was provided by the Government in the proceedings before the Court, stated that the first applicant had been subjected to surveillance in connection with information that three persons of Arab origin who had no identification documents and had contacts with representatives of Palestinian and Lebanese extremist organisations from southern Lebanon were residing in Burgas. The proposal also stated that in 2002 the first applicant had organised a drug trafficking channel from Brazil through western Europe to Bulgaria. It referred to the interception at Sofia Airport on 12 September 2002 of a shipment which originated from Sao Paulo, was addressed to the applicant, and contained 8.64 kilograms of almost one hundred per cent pure cocaine. A criminal investigation had been opened into this matter. The proposal went on to say that, having failed to complete that transaction, the first applicant had “not given up his attempts to find a quick way of making money”. There existed operative information that in 2005 he had tried to organise the shipment of 300 kilograms of cocaine from Brazil to the Netherlands. It had also been established that he was a member of an international gang engaging in the forgery of securities, frauds, and criminal banking operations. There was information that he had contacts with Bulgarian and foreign nationals residing in Bulgaria, as well as with persons from England, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Syria and Lebanon. Also, there existed operative information that on 11 September 2004 he had tried to convince several persons to kill a person residing in Germany. He also maintained regular contacts with persons abroad who were privy to his criminal activities. Lastly, there existed information that on 2 December 2005 he had telephoned the United States embassy in the Hague, making false assertions that a terrorist act had been planned against it, and had given details implicating a cousin of his, in order to frame him and thus exact revenge for the refusal of his cousin’s father to lend him money. All of those incidents showed that it was necessary to expel the first applicant in order to prevent him from carrying out activities that could imperil national security, such as the laundering of money of terrorist organisations, drug trafficking, forgery of securities and money, criminal banking operations involving large amounts, and the organisation and management of an international gang carrying out “wet jobs”. That was also necessary to prevent the establishment in Bulgaria of sleeper terrorist cells.', '13.  The first applicant was presented with the order on 16 March 2006, but was apparently not given a copy of it. The same day the police searched his home and a storage facility where he was working, and detained him in a detention facility in Burgas.', '14.  On an unspecified date the first applicant appealed against the expulsion order to the Minister of Internal Affairs. He also requested the suspension of the order’s enforcement. Apparently the appeal was unsuccessful.', '15.  On an unspecified date the first applicant sought judicial review of the order by the Sofia City Court. He also requested the suspension of the order’s enforcement. The case was classified. On 10 May 2006 the court decided to accept the application for examination. It went on to say that it would rule on the request for suspension of the order’s enforcement after it had received a copy of the classified proposal on which it had been based.', '16.  In a decision of 7 June 2006 (опр. от 7 юни 2006 г. по адм. д. № С‑61\/2006 г., СГС, ІІІ „д” с‑в.) the Sofia City Court decided to suspend the order’s enforcement. The first applicant was released the same day. However, on an appeal by the National Security Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in a final decision 24 July 2006 (опр. № 8‑82 от 24 юли 2006 г. по адм. д. № ЗС‑250\/2006 г., ВАС, V о.) the Supreme Administrative Court quashed that decision. It held that the courts were not entitled to suspend the enforcement of administrative decisions which were immediately enforceable by operation of law, such as the one under consideration. However, the first applicant was not re‑arrested.', '17.  In the course of the proceedings the authorities submitted the excerpts of the proposal for the first applicant’s expulsion. They also submitted excerpts of other documents in support of the assertions in the proposal. The applicant was not able to present copies of any of those documents to the Court because they were classified.', '18.  In view of amendments to the Aliens Act 1998 making expulsion orders subject to review by the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraph 41 below), on an unspecified date after 10 April 2007 the Sofia City Court sent the case to the Supreme Administrative Court.', '19.  On 27 February 2008 the first applicant requested the court to direct the authorities to adduce evidence in support of their allegations against him; apparently the court did not accede to his request, but gave him leave to obtain a certificate from the prosecuting authorities in relation to the existence or otherwise of criminal proceedings against him. The applicant obtained two such certificates and presented them to the court. The first one, issued by the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office, stated that the drugs shipment intercepted at Sofia Airport in 2002 (see paragraph 12 above) had been addressed to a company owned by two individuals different from the first applicant; that after that criminal proceedings had been opened against an unknown perpetrator and had been suspended because the perpetrator’s identity could not be established; and that between 2002 and 2008 that office had not opened criminal proceedings against the first applicant. The second certificate, issued by the Sofia District Prosecutor’s Office, stated that between 2002 and 2008 that office had not opened criminal proceedings against the first applicant.', '20.  In a memorial submitted to the Supreme Administrative Court, the first applicant argued that the expulsion order had been issued in breach of the rules of administrative procedure because he had not been informed of the proceedings or allowed to make objections or representations. Moreover, the order had been served on him without an interpreter and he had not been given a copy of it. The order was also in breach of the substantive law because it was not based on genuine evidence that he represented a national security risk. The case file contained a redacted copy of the proposal on which the order had been based, and excerpts from documents which contained allegations that the first applicant had committed various criminal offences and other breaches of the law. However, some of the allegations lacked detail, and there was no indication that he had been criminally prosecuted in relation to any of them. The certificate issued by the prosecuting authorities showed that there were no pending criminal proceedings against him, and that he had nothing to do with the drugs shipment intercepted at Sofia Airport in 2002. The documents presented by the authorities could in effect be characterised as unsupported assertions. The first applicant went on to point out that he was a refugee and to argue that his expulsion to an Arab country would put his life at risk. Lastly, he stated that he had a wife and children, and maintained that the enforcement of the expulsion order would separate him from them for a long time, in breach of Article 8 of the Convention.', '21.  In a final judgment of 2 June 2008 (реш. № 8‑9 от 2 юни 2008 г. по адм. д. № ЗС‑162\/2007 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.) the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s legal challenge to the expulsion order. It held that the order had been issued by a competent authority and in due form. There had not been any material breaches of the rules of administrative procedure. It was true that the authorities had not notified the first applicant of the proceedings against him and had not given him an opportunity to make objections and representations. However, that omission had not been material, because the first applicant had had the opportunity of putting forward his arguments against expulsion in the judicial review proceedings. The fact that the expulsion order had been served on him without an interpreter was not a problem either, because there existed evidence that he understood and spoke Bulgarian. The court went on to say that on the basis of the materials adduced in the proceedings, which had in effect not been disputed by the first applicant, it considered it established that in 2002 he had taken part in the organisation of a drug trafficking channel from Brazil through western Europe to Bulgaria, and in 2005 a drug trafficking channel from Brazil to the Netherlands; that he was an active member of an international gang engaging in the forgery of securities and financial frauds; that he maintained intensive contacts with persons in and out of the country who carried out criminal and terrorist activities; and that he had given the Embassy of the United States of America in the Hague false information that others would try to organise a terrorist act against it. In those circumstances, the authorities’ conclusion that the first applicant’s continued presence in Bulgaria would pose a threat to national security was correct. His arguments that he had not been convicted of criminal offences were irrelevant, because the measure taken against him was preventive. It was admissible to resort to such a measure if there existed enough information that he might carry out a serious offence. Moreover, there existed information that he had already committed narcotic drugs offences and that he was a member of an international criminal organisation. The arguments that the expulsion order fell foul of the Convention and the 1951 Refugee Convention because it was inadmissible to expel the first applicant to a country where his life and health might be at risk and because the expulsion would separate him from his family were likewise unavailing. The expulsion had been lawfully ordered, and the first applicant had been able to challenge it before an independent and impartial court. The expulsion order did not specify the country to which the first applicant should be removed, and the law did not require that it should spell that out. The arguments on that point were therefore irrelevant.', '22.  On 31 July 2008 the head of the Migration Directorate at the Ministry of Internal Affairs issued an order for the applicant’s detention pending the enforcement of the order for his expulsion. He referred to the need to make arrangements for the first applicant’s removal to his country of origin. He went on to say that in view of the grounds for the order and the risk that its enforcement might be hindered, it was immediately enforceable. Lastly, he instructed the competent officials to make arrangements for the first applicant’s expulsion within six months, and to report on their actions.', '23.  The first applicant was given a copy of the order on 1 August 2008. He refused to sign it, as was certified by two witnesses. He was arrested the same day and apparently placed in a special detention facility in Sofia.', '24.  On 8 August 2008 the first applicant requested the head of the Migration Directorate not to expel him as it would expose his life to risk. He referred to section 44a of the Aliens Act 1998 (see paragraph 43 below) and to his refugee status. On 11 September 2008 the head of the Migration Directorate stated that the actions of the authorities had been lawful and that they had requested the Embassy of Lebanon to issue a travel document for the first applicant.', '25.  On 8 August 2008 the first applicant also sought judicial review of the detention order and its immediate enforcement. In a decision of 21 August 2008 (опр. № 1959 от 21 август 2008 г. по адм. д. № 4919\/2008 г., АССГ, І о., 6 с‑в) the Sofia City Administrative Court refused to deal with the legal challenge to the order itself, and in a decision of 22 August 2008 (опр. от 22 август 2008 г. по адм. д. № 4783\/2008 г., АССГ, І адм. о., 2 с‑в) it refused to deal with the legal challenge to the order’s immediate enforcement. In both of those decisions it held that since the order was subordinate to the expulsion order and had been issued within the framework of the expulsion proceedings, it could not be regarded as an administrative decision subject to judicial review.', '26.  The first applicant appealed against both decisions. In a final decision of 27 November 2008 (опр. № 12873 от 27 ноември 2008 г. по адм. д. № 12213\/2008 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.) the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the lower court’s decision relating to the order’s immediate enforcement, fully agreeing with its reasoning. However, in a final decision of 20 December 2008 (опр. № 14332 от 20 декември 2008 г. по адм. д. № 14165\/2008 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.) it quashed the lower court’s decision relating to the order itself, holding that the order was subject to judicial review, and remitted the case.', '27.  On remittal, in a judgment of 27 February 2009 (реш. № 8 от 27 февруари 2009 г. по адм. д. № 4919\/2008 г., АССГ, І о., 6 с‑в) the Sofia City Administrative Court examined the application on the merits, but upheld the detention order. It held that the authorities had been entitled to detain the first applicant following the order for his expulsion, and that their discretionary assessment as to whether it was necessary to detain him was not subject to judicial review. It was sufficient that they had referred to the need to make arrangements for his removal. The court went on to say that no evidence had been presented that the first applicant was a refugee or had applied for asylum.', '28.  The first applicant appealed. In a final judgment of 27 November 2009 (реш. № 14330 от 27 ноември 2009 г. по адм. д. № 4856\/2009 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.) the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the lower court’s judgment, fully agreeing with its reasoning.', '29.  In the meantime, a parallel application by the first applicant for judicial review of the detention order was declared inadmissible by the Sofia City Administrative Court in a decision of 25 August 2008 (опр. № 1977 от 25 август 2008 г. по адм. д. № 4784\/2008 г., АССГ, І. о., 16 с‑в). The first applicant’s appealed. In a final decision of 10 November 2008 (опр. № 11923 от 11 ноември 2008 г. по адм. д. № 13404\/2008 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.) the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the lower court’s decision, on the basis that the order was subordinate to the expulsion order, had been issued within the framework of the expulsion proceedings, and could not be regarded as an administrative decision subject to judicial review.', '30.  On 28 January 2010 the Sofia City Administrative Court, acting in the exercise of its powers under the newly enacted section 46a(3) and (4) of the Aliens Act 1998 (see paragraph 51 below), reviewed the first applicant’s detention of its own motion and decided that he should be released, which the authorities did on 1 February 2010.', '31.  The Migration Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs wrote to the Lebanese Embassy in Sofia with requests for it to issue a travel document allowing the first applicant to enter Lebanon on 20 August 2008, 19 December 2008, 23 January 2009 and 13 November 2009. The Lebanese Embassy did not issue such a document. It appears that the Bulgarian authorities also asked the first applicant to specify a safe third country to which he could be removed, but he did not do so.']","facts":"The applicants in this case are a family born in Lebanon and Kuwait, except for the fifth applicant, who was born in Bulgaria and holds Bulgarian citizenship.

B, who suffered from psychiatric disorders due to his traumatic experiences during the Homeland War, subjected the applicant to verbal and physical abuse between 2003 and 2005. He was arrested in November 2005 and indicted for violent behavior but released in December 2005. The applicant moved to a women's shelter with C in January 2006 for safety. B continued his abusive behavior, leading to further legal proceedings, including charges of making death threats against the applicant and a police officer, for which he was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment in 2006. A restraining order was issued, and subsequent appeals by B and the State Attorney's Office were dismissed in 2007, though the sentence was not enforced. Multiple other criminal and minor offenses cases were initiated against B over the years for domestic violence and threatening behavior. Meanwhile, the marriage of the applicant and B was dissolved in November 2006. The applicant faced difficulties in securing safe accommodation due to B's continued harassment, including hiring a private detective to locate her. The legal proceedings against B were ongoing, with several hearings adjourned due to B's absence, and no psychiatric treatment had been ensured despite recommendations. Overall, the applicant struggled with legal enforcement and protective measures against B's continued threat and harassment, affecting her and her daughter's safety and stability.\nArguments: The Court notes that in Opuz, on the basis of reports submitted by the applicants and prepared by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) Committee, the Diyarbakır Bar Association and Amnesty International, it found that general and discriminatory judicial passivity in Turkey, albeit unintentional, had mainly affected women, and considered that the violence suffered by the applicant and her mother could be regarded as gender-based violence which was a form of discrimination against women. Despite the reforms carried out by the Government in recent years, the overall unresponsiveness of the judicial system and the impunity enjoyed by the aggressors, as found in that case, indicated that there had been insufficient commitment to take appropriate action to address domestic violence (see Opuz, cited above, § 200).\nIn support of these findings the Court relied on the Turkish Government's recognition of the general attitude of the local authorities, such as the manner in which the women were treated at police stations when they reported domestic violence, and judicial passivity in providing effective protection to victims (see Opuz, cited above, § 192). Furthermore, the reports submitted indicated that when victims reported domestic violence to police stations, police officers did not investigate their complaints but sought to assume the role of mediator by trying to convince the victims to return home and drop their complaint. In this connection, police officers considered the problem as a family matter with which they could not interfere (see Opuz, cited above, §§ 92, 96, 102 and 195). The reports also showed that there were unreasonable delays in issuing injunctions and in serving injunctions on the aggressors, given the negative attitude of the police officers. Moreover, the perpetrators of domestic violence did not seem to receive dissuasive punishments, because the courts mitigated sentences on the grounds of custom, tradition or honour (see Opuz, cited above, §§ 91-93, 95, 101, 103, 106 and 196).\nThe Court notes at the outset that in the present case the applicant has not submitted any reports in respect of Croatia of the kind concerning Turkey in the Opuz case. There is not sufficient statistical or other information disclosing an appearance of discriminatory treatment of women who are victims of domestic violence on the part of the Croatian authorities such as the police, law-enforcement or health-care personnel, social services, prosecutors or judges of the courts of law. The applicant did not allege that any of the officials involved in the cases concerning the acts of violence against her had tried to dissuade her from pursuing the prosecution of B or giving evidence in the proceedings instituted against him, or that they had tried in any other manner to hamper her efforts to seek protection against B's violence.\nContinuation options:\nA: The Court finds on the material before it that the applicant’s complaints are unsubstantiated and that there is no basis on which to find that she was subjected to discrimination on the ground of her religion or nationality.\nB: The Court observes that the applicant has failed to show that she was treated differently compared to other persons in analogous situations. There is nothing to suggest that the authorities’ decisions were motivated by discrimination. This part of the application is thus unsubstantiated and should be rejected as manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.\nC: Starting from the arguments submitted by the applicant (see paragraphs 89-92 above), the Court will proceed to examine whether they disclose prima facie evidence of discrimination on the basis of gender.\nD: In view of the facts of the instant case, the Court finds that the available evidence is insufficient for it to conclude that the applicant has indeed been discriminated against on any of the grounds prohibited by Article 14.

B, who suffered from psychiatric disorders due to his traumatic experiences during the Homeland War, subjected the applicant to verbal and physical abuse between 2003 and 2005. He was arrested in November 2005 and indicted for violent behavior but released in December 2005. The applicant moved to a women's shelter with C in January 2006 for safety. B continued his abusive behavior, leading to further legal proceedings, including charges of making death threats against the applicant and a police officer, for which he was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment in 2006. A restraining order was issued, and subsequent appeals by B and the State Attorney's Office were dismissed in 2007, though the sentence was not enforced. Multiple other criminal and minor offenses cases were initiated against B over the years for domestic violence and threatening behavior. Meanwhile, the marriage of the applicant and B was dissolved in November 2006. The applicant faced difficulties in securing safe accommodation due to B's continued harassment, including hiring a private detective to locate her. The legal proceedings against B were ongoing, with several hearings adjourned due to B's absence, and no psychiatric treatment had been ensured despite recommendations. Overall, the applicant struggled with legal enforcement and protective measures against B's continued threat and harassment, affecting her and her daughter's safety and stability.\n\nThe Court notes that in Opuz, on the basis of reports submitted by the applicants and prepared by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) Committee, the Diyarbakır Bar Association and Amnesty International, it found that general and discriminatory judicial passivity in Turkey, albeit unintentional, had mainly affected women, and considered that the violence suffered by the applicant and her mother could be regarded as gender-based violence which was a form of discrimination against women.

The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Z.', '5.  On 21 April 2001 the applicant married B and on 14 May 2001 a daughter, C, was born of the marriage. On 13 December 2005 the applicant brought a civil action in the Z. Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Z.), seeking a divorce from B. On 7 November 2006 the court dissolved the marriage of the applicant and B.', \"6.  For the purposes of criminal proceedings instituted against him in 2003, B, who was still the applicant's husband at the time, underwent a psychiatric examination. The relevant part of the report drawn up by two psychiatrists on 6 December 2004 indicated that B had been captured during the Homeland War and detained in a concentration camp from 3 April to 14 August 1992, where he had been tortured and had sustained serious bodily injuries. It also indicated that since 1992 he had been suffering from mental disorders such as anxiety, paranoia, epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\\nThe relevant part of the report reads:\\n“The patient is primarily an emotionally immature person who shows symptoms of chronic PTSD (lowered tolerance of frustration, egocentrism, latent aggressiveness, a tendency towards depressive reactions in stressful situations, as well as a worsening of his condition and impaired social functioning, in particular in family life).\\n...”\", \"7.  On 21 November 2005 B was arrested and detained on suspicion that he had committed the criminal offence of violent behaviour within the family. On 20 December 2005 the Z. State Attorney's Office indicted B in the Z. Municipal Court on charges of violent behaviour within the family. The indictment alleged that from 12 November 2003 to 21 August 2005 B had verbally insulted and threatened the applicant, prevented her from leaving the house and physically assaulted her; on 12 November 2003 he had physically assaulted her by punching her in the belly, throwing her on the floor and continuing to hit and kick her in the body and head; on 7 August 2005 he had hit the applicant in the face, back and hands, causing lacerations; and on 21 August 2005 he had kicked her in the leg.\", \"8.  On 20 December 2005 B was released, after his mother gave a statement saying that she would immediately take B to their house in P. However, after having been released, he continued abusing the applicant and therefore on 9 January 2006 the applicant, together with C, moved to a women's shelter in Z. (hereinafter “the shelter”) run by a non-governmental organisation.\", '9.  The first hearing scheduled before the Z. Municipal Court for 29 March 2006 was adjourned because B did not appear. The second hearing was held on 25 April 2006.', \"10.  On 22 May 2006 the Z. State Attorney's Office extended the indictment to the criminal offence of neglecting and molesting a child or a minor. The extended indictment alleged that between November 2003 and February 2006 B had continually abused the applicant, both verbally and physically, in front of their daughter C, as well as using inappropriate language in respect of C, and had on several occasions punched and kicked C. Consequently, the case was transferred to the juvenile division (odjel za mladež) of the Z. Municipal Court.\", \"11.  Further hearings scheduled for 7 December 2006 and 20 February 2007 were adjourned because B did not appear. A hearing scheduled for 17 April 2007 was adjourned until 9 May 2007 at the request of B's legal representative. At that hearing the judge ordered a psychiatric examination of B.\", '12.  The psychiatric examination established that B suffered from several mental disorders, including PTSD. The report of 2 January 2008 concluded:\\n“In view of his mental state and the need for continued control and supervision, I would recommend that the court order a security measure of psychiatric treatment.\\nTreatment may be carried out in a day hospital and without detention.\\nThis would enable him to follow a regular programme of therapy which would preserve his current relatively stable mental condition and hence diminish the likelihood of his repeating the criminal offences and, in practical terms, remove the risk to his environment.”', '13.  Another hearing was held on 12 March 2008, at which the expert psychiatrist was questioned. The expert stated that, owing to his difficult war experiences, B suffered from PTSD; he was a neurotic person with a slightly below-average intellectual level, reduced emotional capacity and a passive-aggressive personality. For those reasons his understanding of his own actions and his ability to control his impulses were significantly reduced. The expert repeated his recommendation that a security measure of compulsory psychiatric treatment be applied.', \"14.  A hearing scheduled for 29 April 2008 was adjourned until 4 June 2008 at the request of B's legal representative. That hearing was also adjourned because B did not appear. Hearings scheduled for 14 July and 3 October 2008 were adjourned because one of the witnesses, an employee of the Z. Social Welfare Centre, did not appear.\", '15.  At a hearing held on 19 November 2008 the applicant gave evidence and the court accepted proposals by both parties to call further witnesses. At a hearing held on 10 December 2008 four witnesses gave evidence. Further witnesses were called for the hearing scheduled for 21 January 2009, but the hearing was adjourned until 4 March 2009 since B and one prosecution witness did not appear. The hearing scheduled for 4 March 2009 was also adjourned because B did not appear and the hearing scheduled for 2 April 2009 was adjourned because neither B nor the prosecutor appeared.', '16.  On 6 April 2009 judge M.B. asked to be allowed to step down from the case, since in March 2009 B had threatened her and she had reported B to the police (see paragraph 23 below). The president of the Z. Municipal Court granted her request on 21 April 2009.', \"17.  On 9 March 2009 B was admitted voluntarily to a psychiatric hospital, where he stayed until 6 April 2009. On 18 April he again went to a psychiatric hospital voluntarily. On 13 May 2009 the new judge ordered an additional psychiatric examination of B, in order to establish whether he was fit to stand trial. The expert concluded that, even though B's mental condition had deteriorated somewhat, he was still capable of standing trial. B left the hospital on 28 May 2009. Owing to the change of presiding judge in the proceedings, all the evidence had to be presented again. The first hearing in front of the new judge was held on 11 November 2009. A hearing scheduled for 14 December 2009 was adjourned until 13 January 2010 at the request of B's legal representative. A hearing was held on 16 February 2010. The criminal proceedings are still pending.\", \"18.  On 1 March 2006 the Z. State Attorney's Office indicted B in the Z. Municipal Court on charges of making death threats against the applicant on 1 March 2006.\", \"19.  Further to that, on 30 June 2006 B was arrested and detained on suspicion of the criminal offence of making death threats against the applicant and a police officer, I.G. On 27 July 2006 the Z. State Attorney's Office indicted B on charges of making death threats against the applicant and I.G.\", \"20.  On 8 September 2006 the two sets of proceedings were joined. On 16 October 2006 B was found guilty of three counts of making death threats and sentenced to eight months' imprisonment. The relevant extracts from the operative part of the judgment read:\\n“B ...\\nis guilty\\non the grounds that 1. in the period from 29 May to 12 June 2006 ... on the official premises of the Social Welfare Centre, during meetings with minor child C, in order to incite feelings of fear in his former wife A, he whispered several times in her ear that she was a villain, that he was going to get rid of her, that she knew what he was capable of and that she would be swallowed up by darkness; on 14 June 2006 after the meeting with his minor child, he approached A on the street in front of the building of the Social Welfare Centre and whispered in her ear to beware of him and that he was going to get rid of her, which caused in A feelings of anxiety and fear for her own life... 2. during November 2005, in Z., on the premises of ... police station during an interview [with the police conducted] following a criminal complaint against him on allegations of having committed the criminal offence of violent behaviour within the family ... told a policewoman ..., in order to incite in her feelings of fear, that she brought shame upon the Croatian police, that she was conspiring against him with his former wife, that he knew the head of the police ... and Minister ... that these were her last days in police service and that he was going to get rid of her; on 19 January 2006 in the Zagreb Minor Offences Court during her testimony, he repeated that she brought shame upon the Croatian police, that she was conspiring against him with his former wife and that he was going to get rid of her, that he was not going to beat her but would have done with her and would remember her, which caused in her feelings of fear and of a risk to her own life... 3. on 21 November 2005 in Z., on the premises of ... police department, in order to incite in her feelings of fear and fear for her personal safety, called wife A several times on her cellular phone, telling her to withdraw her criminal complaint against him and, when she refused, told her that she would be swallowed up by darkness, to beware of him, that nothing was going to be as before and that he was going to put her in jail, which caused in A feelings of fear and fear for her personal safety...”\", '21.  On 24 October 2006 B was released from detention. On the same day the Z. Municipal Court issued a restraining order against B, prohibiting access to the applicant at a distance of less than three hundred metres, and prohibiting contact with the applicant.', \"22.  Both the Z. State Attorney's Office and B lodged appeals against the first-instance judgment. On 22 May 2007 the judgment was upheld by the Z. County Court and thus became final. The judgment has not yet been enforced.\", \"23.  On an unspecified date the Z. State Attorney's Office indicted B in the Z. Municipal Court on charges of making death threats against judge M.B. and her minor daughter (see paragraph 16 above). In the course of the proceedings B was arrested on 4 September 2009 and placed in pre-trial detention. On 19 October 2009 the Z. Municipal Court found B guilty as charged and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment and also ordered his compulsory psychiatric treatment. It seems that B is still in detention but no information has been provided as to where and whether any psychiatric treatment has been provided.\", '24.  On 7 January 2004 a police station lodged a request with the Z. Minor Offences Court (Prekšajni sud u Z.) for minor offences proceedings to be instituted against B. It was alleged that on 12 November 2003 B had assaulted the applicant and pushed her onto the floor, while kicking her in the body and head.', '25.  At a hearing held on 8 June 2004 the applicant refused to give evidence and the proceedings were discontinued.\\n(b)  The second and third sets of proceedings', '26.  On 14 November 2005 a police station lodged two requests with the Z. Minor Offences Court for minor offences proceedings to be instituted against B.', '27.  In the first request, it was alleged that on 21 August 2005 B had verbally abused the applicant in front of C and had kicked the applicant in the leg. In a decision of 20 November 2006 the court found B guilty of domestic violence and imposed a fine in the amount of 2,000 Croatian kuna (HRK). There is no indication that this fine has been enforced.', '28.  In the second request it was alleged that on 7 August 2005 B had first forcefully stopped the applicant from taking a bath and had hit her in the face, back and hands, causing lacerations. In a decision of 19 July 2007 the court found B guilty of domestic violence and imposed a fine in the amount of HRK 7,000. However, this decision did not become final because the proceedings were discontinued on 28 November 2007, having become time-barred.\\n(c)  The fourth set of proceedings', '29.  On 26 March 2006 the applicant lodged a request with the Z. Minor Offences Court under the Protection against Domestic Violence Act, for minor offences proceedings to be instituted against B. She alleged that since 29 March 2005 B had repeatedly assaulted her in front of C and caused her bodily injuries. These were described in the enclosed medical reports of 29 March and 16 August 2005 as contusions to the upper lip, right calf and right foot. The injuries were classified as minor bodily injuries. He had further threatened to kill her on 1 February 2006.', '30.  The applicant also requested that protective measures be immediately imposed in the form of prohibiting access to her proximity, a prohibition on harassing or stalking her and compulsory psycho-social treatment. The applicant explained that B had been diagnosed with several mental disorders and had been undergoing treatment for years. She requested that the proceedings be instituted as a matter of urgency.', \"31.  The court held a preliminary hearing (pripremno ročište) on 27 June 2006, and subsequent hearings on 19 September 2006 and 26 September 2006. In a decision of 2 October 2006 the court found B guilty of domestic violence and imposed a fine in the amount of HRK 6,000. A protective measure prohibiting access to the applicant at a distance of less than one hundred metres for a period of one year was also ordered, as well as a protective measure of compulsory psycho-social treatment for a period of six months. The relevant extracts from the operative part of the decision read:\\n“B\\nis guilty\\non the grounds that\\non 1 February 2006 in their flat ... he threatened his wife with the following words: 'I will kill you, you won't walk again ... you will never see your child again' in the presence of their minor child C ... which acts of violence he repeated on several subsequent occasions causing her physical injuries also ...”\", '32.  On 30 October 2006 the applicant lodged an appeal, arguing that a protective measure in the form of a prohibition on harassing or stalking her and C and a protective measure of prohibition of access to C should have also been applied. She argued further that the measure of prohibition on access to her was not sufficiently precise because the court had failed to specify the date on which the measure was to be implemented. B also lodged an appeal.', '33.  The appeals of B and the applicant were dismissed on 31 January 2007 by the High Minor Offences Court.', '34.  B paid HRK 1,000 of the fine. The remaining fine in the amount of HRK 5,000 was supplemented by a prison term which B has not served. The Government explained that this was because Z. Prison was full to capacity. Furthermore, B has not undergone the compulsory psycho-social treatment because of the lack of licensed individuals or agencies able to execute such a protective measure. Execution of the sentence became time-barred on 31 January 2009.', '35.  On 10 December 2007 the applicant informed the Z. Minor Offences Court that B had violated the restraining order and that in October 2007 he had hired a private detective who had come to her secret address where she had been living after leaving the shelter. The applicant reiterated her request for the application of an additional protective measure in the form of a prohibition on harassing and stalking a victim of violence. Her request was dismissed in a decision of the Z. Minor Offences Court of 12 December 2007 on the ground that she had not shown an immediate risk to her life. On 17 December 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision. The court dismissed her appeal on 7 January 2008. The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against that decision on 18 February 2008. On 19 March 2008 the Constitutional Court found that it had no jurisdiction in the matter.', \"36.  On an unspecified date the applicant and C left the shelter and went to live at a secret address. On 14 October 2007 an unknown man appeared at their door. The applicant's partner opened and the man at the door introduced himself as a private detective hired by B to find out the whereabouts of the applicant and C.\", '37.  The applicant moved out and lived in a nearby village for five months. According to the applicant, she was not able to find new accommodation elsewhere because all the landlords she had approached answered that they had no wish to deal with her violent ex-husband.', '38.  In the course of the divorce proceedings between the applicant and B, the Z. Municipal Court issued an interim measure on 9 March 2006 and ordered contact between B and C twice a week for one hour on the premises of the Z. Social Welfare Centre, under expert supervision. The applicant did not comply with the decision, so on 23 May 2006 the court threatened her with a fine unless she complied with the order. After that decision the applicant complied with the interim measure until mid-June 2006.', '39.  On 7 November 2006 the Z. Municipal Court dissolved the marriage of the applicant and B and also ordered B to pay child maintenance for C. It further prohibited B from contacting C. Both parties lodged appeals, and on 11 September 2007 the Z. County Court (Županijski sud u Z.) upheld the divorce but quashed the first-instance judgment concerning the amount of maintenance to be paid in respect of C and the ban on contact between B and C, and remitted the case in that part.', \"40.  On 7 October 2008 the Z. Municipal Court gave a fresh judgment on the amount of maintenance and ordered contact between B and C twice a month for two hours in a children's play centre in Z., under the expert supervision of the Z. Social Welfare Centre. Both parties lodged appeals, and on 27 January 2009 the Z. County Court upheld the part of the judgment concerning contact between B and C, quashed the decision on maintenance and remitted the case in that part. The proceedings on the child maintenance are still pending.\"]","facts":"The applicant, born in 1979, married B in April 2001, giving birth to a daughter, C, shortly after.

She became the personal assistant to the College Principal in 1995 and worked closely with the newly appointed Deputy Principal from late 1995. Starting in 1998, the applicant's telephone, email, and Internet usage were monitored at the behest of the Deputy Principal, allegedly to determine if she was misusing College resources for personal reasons. This monitoring activity involved detailed records of her communications and was contested both in scope and in legality. The applicant suspected inappropriate surveillance, including intrusions into her personal calls, emails, and even her movements. She provided evidence, including email printouts, and learned from colleagues about similar surveillance activities. Despite the lack of an explicit policy on monitoring at the College, the Deputy Principal had initiated the investigation into her communications, causing the applicant to question the legitimacy and motives of such actions. Following complaints, the College Principal ordered a halt to the e-mail monitoring due to impending legislation prohibiting unauthorized surveillance. The applicant, still employed at the College, was informed of the Deputy Principal's suspension after staff corroborated the intrusive monitoring claims.\nArguments: The applicant did not accept that her e-mails had not been read and that her telephone calls had not been intercepted but contended that, even if the facts were as set out by the Government, it was evident that some monitoring activity had taken place amounting to an interference with her right to respect for her private life and correspondence.\nShe referred to legislation subsequent to the alleged violation, namely the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and the Telecommunications (Lawful Business Practice) Regulations 2000 (see paragraph 20 above), which she claimed were an explicit recognition by the Government that such monitoring amounted to interference under Article 8 and required authorisation in order to be lawful. Since these laws came into force in 2000, the legal basis for such interference post-dated the events in the present case. Thus, the interference had no basis in domestic law and was entirely different from the position in Peck (see paragraph 34 above), where the local authority was specifically empowered by statute to record visual images of events occurring in its area. In the present case there was no such express power for the College to carry out surveillance on its employees and the statutory powers did not make such surveillance reasonably foreseeable.\nThe applicant asserted that the conduct of the College was neither necessary nor proportionate. There were reasonable and less intrusive methods that the College could have used, such as drafting and publishing a policy dealing with the monitoring of employees’ usage of the telephone, Internet and e-mail.\nContinuation options:\nA: The Court observes that it has found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in that the national courts failed to establish the relevant facts and to perform an adequate balancing exercise between the applicant’s right to respect for his private life and correspondence and the employer’s interests. It does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged, and therefore dismisses this claim.\nB: The Court notes the Government’s acceptance that the College is a public body for whose acts they are responsible for the purposes of the Convention. Thus, it considers that in the present case the question to be analysed under Article 8 relates to the negative obligation on the State not to interfere with the private life and correspondence of the applicant and that no separate issue arises in relation to home or family life.\nC: The Court considers that the complaint should be examined under Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”\nD: The Court reiterates that it is the master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of a case (see, for instance, Aksu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 4149\/04 and 41029\/04, § 43, ECHR 2012). In the present case, it considers that the applicant’s complaint concerns exclusively the remedies available to her against her stepfather, not those available against the State to enforce the substance of a Convention right or freedom at the national level. The complaint is therefore to be examined under Article 8 of the Convention alone, which provides as follows:\n“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2.

The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Llanelli, Wales.', '7.  In 1991 the applicant was employed by Carmarthenshire College (“the College”). The College is a statutory body administered by the State and possessing powers under sections 18 and 19 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 relating to the provision of further and higher education.', '8.  In 1995 the applicant became the personal assistant to the College Principal (“the CP”) and from the end of 1995 she was required to work closely with the newly appointed Deputy Principal (“the DP”).', '9.  In about July 1998, whilst on annual leave, the applicant visited another campus of the College with a male director. She subsequently became aware that the DP had contacted that campus to enquire about her visit and understood that he was suggesting an improper relationship between her and the director.', '10.  During her employment, the applicant’s telephone, e-mail and Internet usage were subjected to monitoring at the DP’s instigation. According to the Government, this monitoring took place in order to ascertain whether the applicant was making excessive use of College facilities for personal purposes. The Government stated that the monitoring of telephone usage consisted of analysis of the College telephone bills showing telephone numbers called, the dates and times of the calls, and their length and cost. The applicant also believed that there had been detailed and comprehensive logging of the length of calls, the number of calls received and made, and the telephone numbers of individuals calling her. She stated that on at least one occasion the DP became aware of the name of an individual with whom she had exchanged incoming and outgoing telephone calls. The Government submitted that the monitoring of telephone usage took place for a few months up to about 22 November 1999. The applicant contended that her telephone usage was monitored over a period of about eighteen months until November 1999.', '11.  The applicant’s Internet usage was also monitored by the DP. The Government accepted that this monitoring took the form of analysing the websites visited, the times and dates of the visits to the websites and their duration, and that this monitoring took place from October to November 1999. The applicant did not comment on the manner in which her Internet usage was monitored but submitted that it took place over a much longer period of time than the Government had admitted.', '12.  In November 1999 the applicant became aware that enquiries were being made into her use of e-mail at work when her step-daughter was contacted by the College and asked to supply information about e-mails that she had sent to the College. The applicant wrote to the CP to ask whether there was a general investigation taking place or whether her e-mails only were being investigated. By an e-mail of 24 November 1999, the CP advised the applicant that, whilst all e-mail activity was logged, the information technology department of the College was investigating only her e-mails, following a request by the DP.', '13.  The Government submitted that monitoring of e-mails took the form of analysis of e-mail addresses and dates and times at which e-mails were sent and that the monitoring occurred for a few months prior to 22 November 1999. According to the applicant, the monitoring of e-mails occurred for at least six months from May to November 1999. She provided documentary evidence in the form of printouts detailing her e‑mail usage from 14 May to 22 November 1999 which set out the date and time of e‑mails sent from her e-mail account together with the recipients’ e‑mail addresses.', '14.  By a memorandum of 29 November 1999, the CP wrote to the DP to confirm the contents of a conversation they had had in the following terms:\\n“To avoid ambiguity I felt it worthwhile to confirm my views expressed to you last week, regarding the investigation of [the applicant’s] e-mail traffic.\\nSubsequent to [the applicant] becoming aware that someone from [the College] had been following up her e-mails, I spoke to [ST] who confirmed that this was true and had been instigated by yourself. Given the forthcoming legislation making it illegal for organisations to examine someone’s e-mail without permission, I naturally felt concerned over recent events and instructed [ST] not to carry out any further analysis. Furthermore, I asked you to do likewise and asked that any information you have of concern regarding [the applicant] be forwarded to me as a matter of priority. You indicated that you would respond positively to both requests, whilst reaffirming your concerns regarding [the applicant].”', '15.  There was no policy in force at the College at the material time regarding the monitoring of telephone, e-mail or Internet usage by employees.', '16.  In about March or April 2000 the applicant was informed by other members of staff at the College that between 1996 and late 1999 several of her activities had been monitored by the DP or those acting on his behalf. The applicant also believed that people to whom she had made calls were in turn telephoned by the DP, or those acting on his behalf, to identify the callers and the purpose of the call. She further believed that the DP became aware of a legally privileged fax that was sent by herself to her solicitors and that her personal movements, both at work and when on annual or sick leave, were the subject of surveillance.', '17.  The applicant provided the Court with statements from other members of staff alleging inappropriate and intrusive monitoring of their movements. The applicant, who is still employed by the College, understands that the DP has been suspended.']","facts":"The applicant, born in 1950 and living in Llanelli, Wales, was employed by Carmarthenshire College, a state-administered educational institution, starting in 1991.

Her properties, located in Turkish-occupied areas, included land partially built with a two-storey house, funded entirely by the applicant as her former husband was unemployed. She attempted to return to her property in 1989 but was blocked by Turkish military authorities. During a peaceful anti-Turkish demonstration on 19 July 1989, marking the anniversary of the intervention, the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment and arrest by Turkish soldiers. Although the demonstration was largely peaceful, the Turkish-Cypriot authorities claimed it was violent and provocatively aimed at dismantling the \"Green Line\" in Nicosia. The applicant was charged, tried without adequate legal representation, and sentenced to three days' imprisonment and a fine. She provided medical documentation substantiating her claims of physical and psychological harm due to the ill-treatment she sustained during detention. Despite allegations by the Turkish government of a violent demonstration, no independent UN report confirmed these claims. The applicant's case is one of several brought to international attention, highlighting ongoing tensions and human rights violations in the region.\nArguments: The applicant argued that she had submitted sufficient proof of ownership. She adopted the observations submitted by the Government of Cyprus (see below).\nAccording to the Government of Cyprus, the burden of proof was on the respondent Government to prove that the applicant did not own the relevant land. In the absence of evidence showing that in July 1974 another individual owned the properties claimed in the present application, the Government should be estopped from denying the applicant's title.\nThe Court first observes that the applicant has never been the registered owner of the properties described in paragraph 8 above. The property belonged to a limited company, of which the applicant's husband was a shareholder. The company subsequently started procedures to transfer this property by way of gift to the applicant's husband. It follows that the applicant herself was neither a shareholder of the company owning the land nor the person who was to benefit from the gift. Therefore, the properties were not her “possessions” (see, mutatis mutandis, Gavriel v. Turkey, no. 41355\/98, § 24, 20 January 2009). It is true that the applicant alleges that she bore the costs of building and furnishing the house that was built on the land. However, no evidence supporting this assertion has been submitted to the Court. In any event, the simple fact of having contributed to the construction works on somebody else's land cannot, in itself, give rise to a legitimate expectation to become the owner of the building and the land on which it stands. It follows that, as far as the property described in paragraph 8 above is concerned, there was no interference with the applicant's rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nContinuation options:\nA: The Court further notes that the documents submitted by the applicant (see paragraph 10 above) provide prima facie evidence that she had title to the land described in paragraph 9 above. As the respondent Government have failed to produce convincing evidence to rebut this, the Court considers that this land was a “possession” of the applicant within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nB: The Court first notes that the documents submitted by the applicants (see paragraphs 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 42, 44 and 45 above) provide prima facie evidence that they had a title to the properties at issue. As the respondent Government have failed to produce convincing evidence to rebut this, the Court considers that these properties were “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It also observes that applicant no. 16 has produced written proof that his father had died before the Turkish invasion and that he had been appointed administrator of his estate (see paragraph 44 above). As far as applicant no. 12 is concerned, it is noted that he was the owner of some of the properties (notably, those described in paragraph 36 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) above) only until 28 July 1998, when they were transferred to his wife and daughters (see paragraph 37 above).\nC: The Court first notes that the applicant has submitted certificates issued by the Departments of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus providing prima facie evidence that he had a title of ownership (in the share of ¼) over the “field with trees” located in the village of Ayios Epiktitos (see paragraph 9 above). As the respondent Government failed to produce convincing evidence in rebuttal, the Court considers that the applicant had a “possession” over this field within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nD: The Court notes, first, that the house in question was acquired and renovated by the first applicant to provide residence for the whole family. It follows that all applicants had a vested pecuniary interest in continuing to live there. Accordingly all applicants may claim that the house constituted their “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court notes, next, that the transfer of the house to the former owner constituted an interference with their right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions.

The company secretary was authorised to take all necessary steps on behalf of the company to effect the transfer. On 11 June 1973 the relevant declaration of transfer was submitted to the Kyrenia District Lands Office. However, the process of transfer and registration was not completed owing to the Turkish military intervention. Meanwhile, in view of the proposed gift of the land, the applicant and her former husband proceeded to build a two-storey house (with a surface area of approximately 200 sq. m.) on it. As at the relevant time Mr Ioannis Vrahimis had no income, the applicant bore the costs of building and furnishing the property. In April 1974, when the house was completed, she moved into it with her family. They intended to live there initially for long periods and then permanently.', '9.

G80; description: field; area: 5,342 sq. m; share: ½;\\n(b) Nicosia, Yerollakkos, plot no. 189, sheet\/plan: XXI\/43.W.I, registration no. G170; description: field; use: development; area: 5,575 sq. m; share: ½;\\n(c) Famagusta, Akanthou, plot no. 327, sheet\/plan: XIV\/2 E1, registration no. 23218; description: field near the sea with water perforation; area: 4,683 sq. m, share: ½.', '10.  In support of her claim to ownership, the applicant submitted copies of the relevant certificates of title of Turkish-occupied immovable properties issued by the Republic of Cyprus.', \"11.  The plots of land described in paragraph 9 (a) and (b) above were registered in the applicant's name until 15 January 1998, when she transferred them by way of gift to her son, Mr Laris Ioanni Vrachimi. The plot described in paragraph 9 (c) above was registered in the applicant's name until 28 March 2000, when she transferred it by way of gift to her other son, Mr Roberto Ioanni Vrachimi (declaration of transfer no. D477). The applicant stated that she intended to divide the plots described in paragraph 9 (a) and (b) above into approximately 16 building sites.\", '12.  The applicant alleged that since the 1974 Turkish intervention she had been deprived of her property rights, as her properties were located in the area that was under the occupation and control of the Turkish military authorities. She had made an attempt to return to her home and property on 19 July 1989, but was not allowed to do so by the Turkish military authorities. They had prevented her from having access to and from using her house and property.', '13.  In 1994 the applicant divorced her husband. In 1996 she made an application to the local tribunal in which she claimed, inter alia, her rights as beneficial owner of the house and the plots of land described under paragraph 8 above. Her claim was based on the fact that she had borne all the expenses for the construction of the house and all the other financial obligations undertaken to secure the grant of the plots of land to her husband.\\nII.  DEMONSTRATION OF 19 JULY 1989', '14.  On 19 July 1989, the applicant joined an anti-Turkish demonstration in the Ayios Kassianos area in Nicosia in which the applicants in the Chrysostomos and Papachrysostomou v. Turkey and Loizidou v. Turkey cases (see below) also took part.', '15.  According to an affidavit sworn by the applicant before the Nicosia District Court on 1 August 2000, the demonstration of 19 July 1989 was peaceful and was held on the fifteenth anniversary of the Turkish intervention in Cyprus, in support of the missing persons and to protest against human-rights violations.', \"16.  The applicant was a member of the co-ordinating Committee of the Pancyprian Women's Movement, Epistrophi and one of the organisers of the demonstration. The demonstrators, mainly women, entered the grounds of the Ayios Kassianos school in Nicosia; one of them climbed a water tank and hung two flags from it, one Cypriot, the other Greek. UNFICYP officers instructed the demonstrators to leave. A little later Turkish soldiers and Turkish policemen carrying shields and electric batons arrived. Their commander shouted in Greek that the demonstrators should leave. They replied that the land belonged to them and that they would not leave; some of them sat on the ground.\", '17.  While the dialogue between the demonstrators and the Turkish forces was continuing, the peacekeepers created a cordon around the women who were sitting near the water tank. When this cordon opened the applicant suddenly felt a powerful blow in the face delivered by a Turkish army officer with whom she had been talking earlier. She was violently seized by the hair, thrown to the ground and beaten by a number of Turkish soldiers. She received, inter alia, a powerful punch in the abdomen and a boot kick to the inner left leg.', '18.  She and other Greek-Cypriots who had taken part in the demonstration were subsequently put in a room with only a small opening that was used as an entrance. She was then taken by bus with other detainees to the so-called “Pavlides Garage”. The crowd outside the garage was swearing, shouting abuse and threats and throwing stones, some of which came through the roof. She was not given any medical attention despite her serious injuries. She complained about her ill-treatment to two members of the UN forces present at the garage. She also asked them to investigate the fate of other women detainees. A Turkish officer denied the facts and shouted at her. Being a lawyer and a spokesperson, the applicant was made to suffer particularly harsh and humiliating treatment at the garage, where she was interrogated. The interrogator, who spoke Greek, tried to imply that somebody had incited the applicant and the other women to demonstrate. The applicant refused to sign a paper written in Turkish, a language which she could not understand. She offered to write her statement in Greek on a blank sheet of paper, but none was given to her.', '19.  At one point in the early hours of the morning she made a request to be allowed to sit on the stands in the garage. The officers ordered her to sit on the floor in front of one of them between the iron bars that supported the basketball net and to stretch her legs over a small wall. She refused and was violently dragged to a car and transported to Seray Police Station. Her left wrist was twisted painfully. During the journey she was beaten and sneered at. She was then put in a very small, filthy cell; owing to the intense heat the air was suffocating. Turkish policemen in civilian clothes continually entered the cell and beat her with an electric baton, harassed her and laughed at her. As a result, she had terrible pain in the abdomen and was unable to eat. The next morning she received an assurance from a Greek-speaking police sergeant that no more ill-treatment would be tolerated. In spite of this, she was visited by three individuals in civilian clothes who warned her not to complain to the court about ill-treatment and to comply with whatever the judge ordered.', '20.  On 20 July 1989 the applicant was taken to court where she attempted to complain about the ill-treatment; however, the judge did not respond to her complaints. She asked for the services of a lawyer registered with the Cyprus Bar Association, but was told that she could only use the services of a Turkish lawyer. The translation provided was very short and in summary form. The court remanded her in custody for three days and ordered her transfer to hospital. She was taken to hospital and medicines were prescribed, but not given to her. Then she was taken back to the police station where she was detained in the same cell and subjected to interrogation of a political nature. After the interrogation she was taken to the central prison. She was given a questionnaire, which she filled in; it was written in English and contained 6 or 7 questions of a political nature and\/or concerning the movement she had joined.', '21.  On 21 July 1989 she was taken back to court. She had no legal representation or proper interpretation. Being a lawyer, she asked to be allowed to represent herself and the other women with her but her request was refused. She was therefore unable to raise two preliminary objections concerning the unlawfulness of her arrest and the invalidity of the trial court. The charges were translated orally to the accused, who pleaded “not guilty”. No written documents stating the charges were given to the accused. The applicant tried to object to the admission of some of the evidence adduced in court, but was not allowed to do so. The translation was partial and incomplete. At no stage were the accused informed of their rights. They were not asked to give sworn testimony or whether they wanted to call witnesses. Only after the prosecution witnesses had been examined did the trial judge ask the accused whether they wanted to say anything.', '22.  The applicant was subsequently taken back to prison. She was interviewed by a television crew and talked about the unlawfulness of her arrest, the ill-treatment she had endured and the absence of borders in Cyprus.', \"23.  On 22 July 1989, late at night, she was again taken to court. An angry crowd, which had gathered outside the courtroom, was booing and insulting the accused. The crowd was very menacing but security measures had been taken. The translator announced that the accused had been convicted on both counts. One young woman shouted “This is not a court, this is a circus”. Immediately afterwards, the judge rose from her seat and retired. When she returned to the bench the applicant informed her that the young woman was a minor and should have been tried by a juvenile court. The judge made no reply. The applicant was sentenced to three days' imprisonment and to a fine of 50 Cyprus pounds (CYP – approximately 85 euros (EUR)) – with five additional days in prison in default of payment within 24 hours.\", '24.  She was taken back to prison. After an incident between one of the other women detainees (Mrs Marianna Petrakidou – see application no. 16081\/90) and some Turkish photographers, the applicant was put in an isolation cell. She remained there until she was released later that day. She was examined by a UN doctor and a Turkish doctor, who took notes and disagreed on the extent of her bruises. The next day she visited the Casualty Department of Nicosia General Hospital, where she was examined by another doctor. The marks from the blows the applicant had received took more than one month to fade. Some photographs showing these marks were produced to the Court.', '25.  In support of her claim of ill-treatment, the applicant produced three medical certificates. The first was issued on 25 July 1989 by Dr Costas Antoniades, a doctor practising in the Casualty Department of Nicosia General Hospital. It reads as follows:\\n“Bruises over medial aspect (L) Thigh, lateral aspect (L) Humerus, posterior aspect (R) Humerus, (L) Scapula region, lateral aspect (R) Thigh. Abrasions both lower legs.\\nX-Rays: (L) Ribs Chest: N.B.D.”', '26.  The second certificate, issued by the same doctor on 10 July 2000, states:\\n“It is certified that the above person was examined by me in the Casualty Department of the Nicosia General Hospital on 25 July 1989 at 4:10 p.m.\\nDuring the examination the following were observed:\\nBruises over medial aspect L Thigh, Lateral aspect L Humerus, posterior aspect R Humerus, Scapula region, lateral aspect R Thigh.\\nAbrasions in both lower legs.\\nX-Rays of L Ribs and Chest showed no bone damage.”', '27.  The third certificate was issued on 12 November 2002 by Dr Th. Constantinides, a cardiologist specialised in internal medicine. It reads as follows:\\n“I first examined Mrs Eleni Vrahimi in June 1998. At the time, Mrs Vrahimi was complaining of chest-pain and super ventricular tachycardia.\\nFrom the medical history of the patient, it transpires that since 1989 she has been suffering from 1) Phobia (Claustrophobia), 2) Headaches and 3) Chest-pain with recurrent episodes of SVT (Super ventricular Tachycardia) and ventricular Extrasystoles. The symptoms first appeared in 1989.\\nThe investigation of the headaches showed normal Brain Computer Tomogram.\\nFor the period of nine years before she first visited me, the patient had visited a number of doctors about the phobia and episodes of arrhythmia. The patient described the episodes as events of palpitations and feeling of running of her heart with chest-pain during her sleep and while and after dreaming.\\nOn the basis of the history of the patient and of the examination I have conducted, I have diagnosed the patient as suffering from psychological trauma which was directly connected to the events of 1989 when she was seized and imprisoned by Turkish forces. The patient has been influenced in her psyche and subconscious by the traumatic experiences as a result of her seizure, imprisonment and ill-treatment at the hands of the Turkish forces. She is now under medical therapy for the above-mentioned diagnoses and she also undergoes complementary psychological therapy.\\nDespite her therapy, the patient is still suffering from:\\n1) Nightmares and sleep disturbances;\\n2) Episodes of arrhythmia during the night, during and after sleep;\\nThese symptoms have a direct adverse effect on her personal, social and professional life.”', '28.  The Government alleged that the applicant had participated in a violent demonstration with the aim of inflaming anti-Turkish sentiment. The demonstrators, supported by the Greek-Cypriot administration, were demanding that the “Green Line” in Nicosia should be dismantled. Some carried Greek flags, clubs, knives and wire-cutters. They were acting in a provocative manner and shouting abuse. The demonstrators were warned in Greek and English that unless they dispersed they would be arrested in accordance with the laws of the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (the “TRNC”). The applicant was arrested by the Turkish-Cypriot police after crossing the UN buffer zone and entering the area under Turkish-Cypriot control. The Turkish-Cypriot police intervened in the face of the manifest inability of the Greek-Cypriot authorities and the UN Force in Cyprus to contain the incursion and its possible consequences.', '29.  No force was used against demonstrators who did not intrude into the “TRNC” border area and, in the case of demonstrators who were arrested for violating the border, no more force was used than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances in order to arrest and detain the persons concerned. No one was ill-treated. It was possible that some of the demonstrators had hurt themselves in the confusion or in attempting to scale barbed wire or other fencing. Had the Turkish police, or anyone else, assaulted or beaten any of the demonstrators, the UN Secretary General would no doubt have referred to this in his report to the Security Council.', '30.  The applicant was charged, tried, found guilty and sentenced to a short term of imprisonment. She pleaded not guilty, but did not give evidence and declined to use the available judicial remedies. She was asked if she required assistance from a lawyer registered in the “TRNC”, but refused and did not ask for legal representation. Interpretation services were provided at the trial by qualified interpreters. All the proceedings were translated into Greek.', \"31.  In his report of 7 December 1989 on the UN operations in Cyprus, the UN Secretary General stated, inter alia:\\n“A serious situation, however, arose in July as a result of a demonstration by Greek Cypriots in Nicosia. The details are as follows:\\n(a) In the evening of 19 July, some 1,000 Greek Cypriot demonstrators, mostly women, forced their way into the UN buffer zone in the Ayios Kassianos area of Nicosia. The demonstrators broke through a wire barrier maintained by UNFICYP and destroyed an UNFICYP observation post. They then broke through the line formed by UNFICYP soldiers and entered a former school complex where UNFICYP reinforcements regrouped to prevent them from proceeding further. A short while later, Turkish-Cypriot police and security forces elements forced their way into the area and apprehended 111 persons, 101 of them women;\\n(b) The Ayios Kassianos school complex is situated in the UN buffer zone. However, the Turkish forces claim it to be on their side of the cease-fire line. Under working arrangements with UNFICYP, the Turkish-Cypriot security forces have patrolled the school grounds for several years within specific restrictions. This patrolling ceased altogether as part of the unmanning agreement implemented last May;\\n(c) In the afternoon of 21 July, some 300 Greek Cypriots gathered at the main entrance to the UN protected area in Nicosia, in which the UN headquarters is located, to protest the continuing detention by the Turkish-Cypriot authorities of those apprehended at Ayios Kassianos. The demonstrators, whose number fluctuated between 200 and 2,000, blocked all UN traffic through this entrance until 30 July, when the Turkish-Cypriot authorities released the last two detainees;\\n(d) The events described above created considerable tension in the island and intensive efforts were made, both at the UN headquarters and at Nicosia, to contain and resolve the situation. On 21 July, I expressed my concern at the events that have taken place and stressed that it was vital that all parties keep in mind the purpose of the UN buffer zone as well as their responsibility to ensure that that area was not violated. I also urged the Turkish-Cypriot authorities to release without delay all those who had been detained. On 24 July, the President of the Security Council announced that he had conveyed to the representatives of all the parties, on behalf of the members of the Council, the Council's deep concern at the tense situation created by the incidents of 19 July. He also stressed the need strictly to respect the UN buffer zone and appealed for the immediate release of all persons still detained. He asked all concerned to show maximum restraint and to take urgent steps that would bring about a relaxation of tension and contribute to the creation of an atmosphere favourable to the negotiations.”\", '32.  The applicant produced 21 photographs taken at different times during the demonstration on 19 July 1989. Photographs 1 to 7 were intended to show that, notwithstanding the deployment of the Turkish-Cypriot police, the demonstration was peaceful. In photographs 8 to 10, members of the Turkish-Cypriot police are seen breaking up the UNFICYP cordon. The final set of photographs show members of the Turkish-Cypriot police using force to arrest some of the women demonstrators.', '33.  The English translation of the judgment given on 22 July 1989 by the “TRNC” Nicosia District Court indicates that the applicant, together with 24 other women, was charged with two offences: entering “TRNC” territory without permission (contrary to sections 2, 8 and 9 of Law no. 5\/72 – see paragraph 40 below) and entering “TRNC” territory other than through an approved port (contrary to subsections 12(1) and (5) of the Aliens and Immigration Law – see paragraph 41 below).', \"34.  The judgment was given in the presence of the accused and of an interpreter. The trial judge noted the following:\\n(i) the accused did not accept the charges against them and stated that they did not wish to use the services of a lawyer registered in the “TRNC”;\\n(ii) the public prosecutor called seven witnesses, whose statements were translated into Greek for the accused's benefit;\\n(iii) the witnesses (mainly police officers on duty at the time of the demonstration) declared that the accused had illegally entered the “TRNC” buffer zone, shouted abuse at the Turkish-Cypriot forces and resisted arrest by pulling and pushing; knives and other cutting objects had been found in the bags of some of the demonstrators who had been arrested;\\n(iv) the accused had been told that they could cross-examine witnesses in turn and, if they so wished, choose one of their number to cross-examine the witnesses on behalf of all the accused; the applicant was chosen to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses on behalf of all the accused. She put to two of the witnesses questions concerning the area in which the events took place and the objects allegedly found in the arrested persons' bags;\\n(v) the applicant made the following statement: “I do not accept the charges. I was in the territory of the Republic of Cyprus. My arrest was illegal. I was subjected to ill-treatment in a bad manner. If there were no spectators here, I could show my wounds. ... it is indecent. Send away the spectators and let us show you our wounds”;\\n(vi) the accused did not call any defence witnesses;\\n(vii) relying on statements by the prosecution witnesses, the “TRNC” District Court came to the conclusion that the accused had crossed the borders of the “TRNC” at an unapproved entry point and without permission and had resisted by various means the UN and Turkish forces which had tried to stop them; the statements made by some of the accused had not undermined the statements of the prosecution witnesses;\\n(viii) the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, so that the accused were guilty on both counts;\\n(ix) in deciding on the sentence, the “TRNC” District Court had taken into account the seriousness of the offence, and the fact that the accused had shown no remorse and continued to deny the validity of the “TRNC”.\"]","facts":"The applicant, born in 1939 and residing in Nicosia, claimed to have been deprived of her property rights after the 1974 Turkish intervention in Cyprus. Her properties, located in Turkish-occupied areas, included land partially built with a two-storey house, funded entirely by the applicant as her former husband was unemployed. She attempted to return to her property in 1989 but was blocked by Turkish military authorities. During a peaceful anti-Turkish demonstration on 19 July 1989, marking the anniversary of the intervention, the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment and arrest by Turkish soldiers. Although the demonstration was largely peaceful, the Turkish-Cypriot authorities claimed it was violent and provocatively aimed at dismantling the \"Green Line\" in Nicosia. The applicant was charged, tried without adequate legal representation, and sentenced to three days' imprisonment and a fine. She provided medical documentation substantiating her claims of physical and psychological harm due to the ill-treatment she sustained during detention. Despite allegations by the Turkish government of a violent demonstration, no independent UN report confirmed these claims. The applicant's case is one of several brought to international attention, highlighting ongoing tensions and human rights violations in the region.","a":"The Court further notes that the documents submitted by the applicant (see paragraph 10 above) provide prima facie evidence that she had title to the land described in paragraph 9 above. As the respondent Government have failed to produce convincing evidence to rebut this, the Court considers that this land was a “possession” of the applicant within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.","b":"The Court first notes that the documents submitted by the applicants (see paragraphs 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 42, 44 and 45 above) provide prima facie evidence that they had a title to the properties at issue. As the respondent Government have failed to produce convincing evidence to rebut this, the Court considers that these properties were “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It also observes that applicant no. 16 has produced written proof that his father had died before the Turkish invasion and that he had been appointed administrator of his estate (see paragraph 44 above). As far as applicant no. 12 is concerned, it is noted that he was the owner of some of the properties (notably, those described in paragraph 36 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) above) only until 28 July 1998, when they were transferred to his wife and daughters (see paragraph 37 above).","c":"The Court first notes that the applicant has submitted certificates issued by the Departments of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus providing prima facie evidence that he had a title of ownership (in the share of ¼) over the “field with trees” located in the village of Ayios Epiktitos (see paragraph 9 above). As the respondent Government failed to produce convincing evidence in rebuttal, the Court considers that the applicant had a “possession” over this field within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.","d":"The Court notes, first, that the house in question was acquired and renovated by the first applicant to provide residence for the whole family. It follows that all applicants had a vested pecuniary interest in continuing to live there. Accordingly all applicants may claim that the house constituted their “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court notes, next, that the transfer of the house to the former owner constituted an interference with their right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions. This was indeed not in dispute between the parties.","label":"A","difficulty_signal_facts_len":0.4573170732,"difficulty_signal_context_len":0.2668004012,"difficulty_signal_option_similarity":0.3979107068,"difficulty_signal_overlap_ambiguity":0.8935585397,"difficulty_signal_negation_density":0.6887488657,"toughness_score":0.5292955277}
